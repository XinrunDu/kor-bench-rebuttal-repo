We need to simplify `(p & q) | (p & !q)` to check if it is equivalent to `p`.\n2. According to Basic Equivalence (5), we know that:\n   - `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)`\n3. Applying this, we have:\n   - `(p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p | (q & !q)`\n4. Now, according to Basic Equivalence (9), `q & !q ::=:: 0`.\n5. Substituting this into the equation:\n   - `p | (q & !q) ::=:: p | 0`\n6. According to Basic Equivalence (8), `p | 0 ::=:: p`.\n7. Hence, `(p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p`. This equivalence is valid.\n\n### For (2) (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q))\n\n1. Let's simplify the left-hand side `(p & !q) | (!p & q)` first:\n   - We cannot simplify this immediately into a known form based on our rules, but we aim to match the right-hand side.\n2. For clarity, let's consider the right-hand side `(p | q) & (!(p | q))`:\n   - `(p | q) & (!(p | q))` can be understood as p|q AND NOT (p|q).\n   - According to the rules of logic, this is `0`.\n\n3. Check the structure of the left-hand side to see if it can be equivalent to `0`:\n   - This equation does not directly simplify using one of the given equivalences in a straightforward manner to a final `0`.\n\n- Based on these observations, we try to test a few plausible values for p and q.\n- When p = 1 and q = 0: `(1 & 1) | (0 & 0) ::=:: 1 :::: 1` matches the left side. Right side yields `1|0 & !(1|0) ::=:: 1 & 0 ::=:: 0`.\n- Therefore, any value doesn't directly yield the same equivalence as the right-hand side, meaning the actual left-hand side formula isn't addressed this way equivalently.\n\nTherefore, (1) is valid and (2) is not.\n\nThe answer is [[A];[B]]."}

Express `>` using negation and disjunction:\n   - `p>q` can be rewritten as `!p | q` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n   - So, `((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))`\n2. Similarly, `p>(q|r)` can be rewritten as `!p | (q | r)` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n3. Now, let's compare `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` with `!p | (q | r)`:\n   - We can use equivalence (5) to simplify and compare.\n   - By equivalence (5), `!p & (!p | (q & r))` is simplified to `!p | (q | r)`.\n   - But the original expression is `(p>q)&(p>r)` which represents `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   - Analyzing further using Basic Equivalences doesn't simplify to `!p | (q | r)` directly.\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (1) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question (2)\nThe expression given is: `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`\n1.

((!p | q) & (!q | p))`\n   - Using De Morgan's Law (6 from Basic Equivalences), `!(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B`\n   - This gives us `! (!p | q) | ! (!q | p)`\n   - Applying De Morgan's Law again, `!!p & !q | !q &!!p`\n   - Simplifying `!!` by (1), `p & !q | !q & p`\n   - Which can be interpreted as `!(p&q) | (p|q)`\n   - This expression is equivalent to `(p | q) & !(p & q)`\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (2) is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer adhering to the given format would be: [[B];[A]]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n(2) (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the given equivalence based on the specified rule, let's first translate the expressions from NAND and NOR to their equivalent forms using `!`, `&`, and `|`.\n\n1. Recall that `p\u21d1q` is defined as `!p | !q` and `p\u21d3q` is defined as `!p & !q`.\n\n2. For (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r, it becomes `(!(p\u21d3q)) & !(r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d3` for `p\u21d3q`, we get `(!(!(p & q))) & !(r)`.\n   - Simplifying `!(!(p & q))`, we get `p & q`.\n   - So, `(p\u21d3q)\u21d3r` becomes `(p & q) & !(r)`.\n\n3. For p\u21d3(q\u21d3r), it becomes `!(q\u21d3r) & !(p)`.\n   - Similarly, substitute the definition of `\u21d3` for `q\u21d3r`, we get `!(!(q & r)) & !(p)`.\n   - Simplifying `!(!(q & r))`, we get `q & r`.\n   - So, `p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)` becomes `!(p) & (q & r)`.\n\nComparing `(p & q) & !(r)` with `!(p) & (q & r)`:\n- They are not identical by direct comparison. Hence, as a simple answer format, (1) does not hold with direct equivalence as all terms cannot be transformed directly to match the structure of one another under the given logical operators.\n\n4. For (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r, it becomes `!((p\u21d1q) | r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d1` for `p\u21d1q`, we get `!( !p | !q | r )`.\n   - Similarly, for p\u21d1(q\u21d1r), it becomes `!(p | !(q\u21d1r))`.\n   - Substitute the definition for `q\u21d1r`, we get `!(!(q | !r) | p)`, which simplifies logically to `!( !p | !q | !r )`.\n\nSince both expressions simplify to the same form: `! (!p | !q | r)` for the first and `!( !p | !q | !r )` for the second under derivation, they indeed hold the same logical equivalence under the rules provided, considering De Morgan's laws and the definition of NOR operator.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

Each disjunction contains propositions and their negations. In fact, if we rewrite the formula, we see that it\u2019s already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses (disjunctions).\n\nGiven the definition provided, however, we have to confirm whether the given formula can be part of a PCNF or PDNF. A principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) is a disjunction of all paired conjunctive terms, while a principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) consists of all paired disjunctive terms.\n\nUpon examination, the given formula is:\n\\[\n(p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly in conjunctive normal form (CNF) because it is a conjunction of disjunctions. The question now is to determine if it can be represented as a PCNF.\n\n**Step 3: Check if this formula fits the PCNF criteria.**\n\nThe formula given \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) needs to be examined against the specifications of PCNF.

But the next question is to check if this represents every possible paired conjunctive term (the correct term would be disjunctive in this case based on the structure of PCNF).\n\nThis particular formula seems to cover a set of clauses that do not constitute all possible disjunctive terms required to represent a complete PCNF for three variables (p, q, r) which would require all possible combinations and closures (or openings) of these variables to cover all cases.\n\nSince \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) does not form all possible clauses for three variables \\( (p, q, r) \\), and strictly following the specified rule, it does not meet the definition of a PCNF as it does not cover every situation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if it can be denoted in the described form.**\n\nGiven the analysis, since the formula does not cover all paired disjunctive terms for a full PCNF of three variables, it does not fit the full PCNF criteria.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[B]}\n\\]"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "For a formula A that contains 4 propositional variables to be a basic form, it must include the paired conjunctive term *m0*, representing the basic assignment where all propositional variables and their negations are false. In the context of the question, this means that the formula must be true for the binary assignment 0000 (which corresponds to hexadecimal 0).\n\nFor A to also be an all-even formula, all the paired conjunctive terms in its principal disjunctive normal form must have even indices (in hexadecimal), which means the binary representation of these indices must end in 0.\n\nGiven that there are 16 (2^4) possible truth assignments for 4 propositional variables, the even hexadecimal numbers in this range are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A (10), C (12), and E (14) in hexadecimal, corresponding to binary numbers ending in 0. There are 8 such even hexadecimal numbers.\n\nHowever, since we already know one of those terms must be *m0* for the formula to be a basic form, there is only one way to select *m0* and the rest of the 7 even terms must all be included in the formula to maintain the all-even property. That means there is only one unique formula that satisfies both being a basic form and an all-even form with the given conditions.\n\nThus, the answer is [[1]]."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statement \"All pencils are not pens\" can be understood as asserting that every pencil does not have the property of being a pen. This fits the form of a Universal Negative proposition, where the universal quantifier \"all\" is used and the negative connective \"are not\" is employed.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the specified format is:\n\n[[SEP]]"}

The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked."}

This implies that it's not necessary for a person to pull their own hair and leave the earth at the same time, which aligns with the modal logic inference formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p. Since we negate the necessity, the formula is applied in its direct form, indicating that if something is not necessarily true (#p \u2192 !#!p), it can infer that it's not necessarily necessarily true, which closely corresponds to the given inference. However, finding the formula that matches the inference of possibility ($p) requires looking at the contraposition and relationships between necessity and possibility directly, aligning closely with deduction rule (5) but aimed at showing the transition to possibility as presented."}

For this question, we're only comparing the two statements to each other based on the rules we have. Since there's no direct time-related statement contrast provided here, and the question asks for an implicit relationship using the same logic framework, we may infer that they're independent statements, falling under a non-interactive relationship which is closest represented by the \u2042 Relationship (Rule 4) where both statements (or lack thereof) can be true or false independently.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[D]]"}

Specifically, \"It is not true that Xiao Lin will never win\" can be understood as a negation that overcomes the never, thus leaving us with a positive statement about the future - \"Xiao Lin will win\". Since we're dealing with the negation structure, in terms of time relations, this takes the form of \"\u00acG\u00acp\", which by formula (16) is equivalent to \"Fp\".\n\nTherefore, for the first pair, we're dealing with \"Fp\" and \"Fp\", which, however, was not directly included in the given relationships but follows the logic implied by relationship (3) \u26ad, as it states that \"Fp and F\u00acp cannot both be false.\" The direct application here can be tricky, as it implies a self-relation that is true by the \u26ad rule, meaning it can both be true.\n\n(2) For \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\", we denote this as \"Gp\", a future period statement.\nFor \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\", which is more about a future point in time, we denote this as \"Fp\".\n\nLooking at the relationships defined:\n- The pair \"Gp and Fp\" fits the description of the fourth relationship (4) \u2042 which allows both statements to either be true or false simultaneously.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1) The first pair (Fp \u2194 Fp) falls under the \u26ad Relationship as they can both be true (as per (3)).\n(2) The second pair (Gp \u2194 Fp) fits the \u2042 Relationship as per rule (4).\n\nFinal Answer: [[C];[D]]"}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A]\n\nExplanation: The scenario described aligns with Method \u2e2e. It is observed that multiple work areas showed ground subsidence, but these areas had varying conditions such as layout of workplaces and geographical conditions. The only common factor was the presence of a higher concentration of textiles, with associated high numbers of deep wells and underground water usage. Different cases (A, B, C, etc.) represented different workplace conditions where subsidence (P) occurred in all despite the variance in other conditions, leading to an inferred causal connection between the higher concentration of textiles and the subsidence. This pattern fits the description given in Method \u2e2e, suggesting that S (a higher concentration of textiles) may have a causal relationship with P (ground subsidence)."}

The positive group shows that when salivary glands are present (S), the wounds heal at a normal rate (P). The negative group shows that when salivary glands are absent (S'), the wounds heal slower (P'). Since the groups are identical in all other respects (A, B, C, D, E, F differing only in the salivary glands condition), the method is applied correctly, leading to the inference that salivary glands may have a causal relationship with the rate of wound healing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[C]]."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The causal derivation described in the passage corresponds to the identification of an unexpected outcome after the removal of a known factor (uranium in this case), leading to the discovery of another factor (the radioactive element radium or polonium) contributing to the observed phenomenon (radioactivity). This matches the characteristic of the \ua66e method, where the absence of one factor (S) leads to the absence of the effect (P) in the negative group, indicating a causal link.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n[[C]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nThere are two types of analogical reasoning:\n\n1. \u03a8 Method:\n    Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n    Object B has attributes a, b, c;\n    Therefore, Object B also has attribute d.\n    Here, attributes a, b, c are referred to as #\u03a8 attributes, and d is referred to as the +\u03a8 attribute.\n    \n2. \u2318 Method: \n    Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n    Object B does not have attributes a, b, c;\n    Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d.\n    Here, attributes a, b, c are referred to as -\u2318 attributes, and d is referred to as the +\u2318 attribute.\n\n### Question:\nH University can reach a new level after reform. Since F University is an established school with strong faculty and a good academic atmosphere, it has reached a new level after reform; and H University is also an established school with strong faculty and a good academic atmosphere as well, the basic conditions of the two schools are the same.\n\nThis reasoning follows the \u03a8 Method, where \"being an established school\" is what kind of attribute?\nA. #\u03a8 attribute   B. +\u03a8 attribute\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nIn this scenario, the reasoning follows the \u03a8 Method as outlined in the logic rule provided. The argument suggests that since H University and F University share similar conditions (\"being an established school with strong faculty and a good academic atmosphere\"), and F University has reached a new level after reform, H University is also expected to reach a new level after reform.\n\nThe similar conditions here are the shared attributes between F University and H University which in the context of the \u03a8 Method are the #\u03a8 attributes, while \"reaching a new level after reform\" would be the +\u03a8 attribute. Thus, \"being an established school\" is one of the #\u03a8 attributes."}

Thus, strictly adhering to the definition, it represents a step toward the BC Paradox but does not fully represent it on its own.\n\nGiven the exact phrasing of the question and the strong expectation to match the demonstration exactly with the definition:\n[[B]] \n\nBut it's noteworthy that this statement is a component part of what could lead to the demonstration of the BC Paradox under the described logical framework."}

However, the question appears to expect a categorization. Given that the minimalization criterion could suggest a slight relationship with C% due to the statement involving the minimal information \"the beer is warm,\" but ultimately expanding the definition of what \"food\" is, the closest alignment would be with the principle that aims for clarity and relevancy of information conveyed rather than a direct inference jump. \n\nStill, considering options and the alignment that could loosely frame the minimal informativity of the statement, the answer should be considered in terms of the closest logical fit within provided constraints.

To prove: p (The original proposition we want to prove is \"p.\")\n2. Assume: Not p (We start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, which is \"not p.\")\n3. Prove: If Not p, then q (We determine what would follow if \"not p\" were true.)\n4. Not q (We then show that what follows under the assumption of \"not p\" is not true, i.e., \"q\" is not true.)\n5. Therefore, Not (Not p) (Since the assumption of \"not p\" leads to a contradiction (Not q when we assumed If Not p, then q), we conclude that the assumption \"not p\" cannot be true.)\n6.
