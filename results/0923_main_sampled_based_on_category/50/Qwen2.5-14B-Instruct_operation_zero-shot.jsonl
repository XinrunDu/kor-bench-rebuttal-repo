However, since 3 is odd, our calculation starts with the next even number, which is 4, and ends with X (which needs to be even because the average needs to result in an integer, in this case, 6).\n\nThe average of these even numbers is given to be 6. \n\nLet's denote the sequence of even numbers from 4 to X as E1, E2, ..., EN. The formula for the average of these numbers is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{E1 + E2 + \\ldots + EN}{N} = 6 \\]\n\nFirst, figure out the sequence of even numbers whose average is 6:\n- The sequence is 4, 6, 8, ..., X.\n- To find X, we observe that if the sequence is 4, 6, and 8, their average is \\((4+6+8)/3 = 6\\).\n\nThus, X must be such that the average of the even numbers from 4 to X equals 6. Working through:\n\n- For X=4, the average of the sequence {4} is not 6.\n- For X=6, the average of the sequence {4, 6} is \\((4+6)/2 = 5\\).\n- For X=8, the average of the sequence {4, 6, 8} is \\((4+6+8)/3 = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, X must be 8.\n\nThe answer is [[8]]."}
