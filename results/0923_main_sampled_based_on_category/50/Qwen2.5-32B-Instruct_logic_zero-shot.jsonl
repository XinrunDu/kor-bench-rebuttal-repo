A. Yes B. No\n(1) p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)\n(2) (p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer the question, we need to individually check if the given equivalences are valid according to the provided logical rules.\n\n### Checking (1) p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q)\n\n1. Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4. From the identity of AND with a true statement, we know that p&1 is logically equivalent to p itself.\n5. Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8. Thus, this equivalence cannot be universally proven as valid according to the given equivalences rules since the right-hand side simplifies to a contradiction which does not capture the variability of the left-hand side correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A];[B]]"}

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n(2) (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the given problem, let's break it down into the two parts and analyze them according to the specified logical operations and equivalences.\n\n### Part 1: (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n\n1. By equivalence (16), \\(p\u21d3q ::=:: !p & !q\\).\n2. Let's replace the NOR operations with AND operations: \\((p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: (!p & !q)\u21d3r\\).\n3. Using the equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p & !q) & !r\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\(!!p | !!q & !r\\).\n5. Using equivalence (1) (\\(A ::=:: !!A\\)), this simplifies further to \\(p | q & !r\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand side.\n1. By the same process, \\(q\u21d3r ::=:: !q & !r\\).\n2. Thus, \\(p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) ::=:: !p & !(q\u21d3r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d3r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5. Simplifying again using equivalence (1), we get \\(!p & (!q | r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) \\) translates to \\(p | q & !r ::=:: !p & (!q | r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p\u21d1q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: (!p | !q)\u21d1r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) \u21d1 r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)\u21d1r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6. Applying De Morgan's law, this simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\), which further simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n\nFor the right-hand side:\n1. \\(q\u21d1r ::=:: !q | !r\\).\n2. So, \\(p\u21d1(q\u21d1r) ::=:: !p | !(q\u21d1r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d1r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p | !(!q | !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p | (q & r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\\) translates to \\((p | q)\u21d1r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\), or more accurately, \\(!(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent either. Hence, this equivalence is also not valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince neither of the equivalences is valid, the answers are both negative.\n\nThe final answer is: [[B];[B]]"}

This expression already is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) because it is the disjunction of two basic conjunction terms. The next step is to identify the true assignments that make these conjunctions true and then denote them according to the given rules.\n\nThe expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) simplifies to \u00acp^r because for the conjunction \u00acp^\u00acq^r to be true, p must be false and r must be true. Similarly, for \u00acp^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true.

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form given that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, we need to understand the specific conditions for these forms.\n\n1. **Basic Form**: A formula is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\). This means there is at least one true assignment which corresponds to 0000 in binary or 0 in hexadecimal (indicating that all variables and their negations are false, which is the assignment \\(m_0\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. That is, the binary representations corresponding to these hexadecimal numbers are:\n   - 0 (0000)\n   - 2 (0010)\n   - 4 (0100)\n   - 6 (0110)\n   - 8 (1000)\n   - A (1010)\n   - C (1100)\n   - E (1110)\n\nSince a basic form must include \\(m_0\\) (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0), and for it to also be an all-even form, we must include 0000 and can include any combination of the remaining even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).\n\nThe question is how many combinations of the remaining 7 even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) we can have along with 0. This is simply the number of subsets of a set with 7 elements (including the empty subset, which corresponds to only having \\(m_0\\)).\n\nThe number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, for 7 elements, we have \\(2^7 = 128\\) subsets.\n\nThus, the answer to the question of how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form is:\n\n[[128]]"}

The expression is (p\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2228r) and we are looking for inputs which would result in the output \"-\". This means the entire expression must evaluate to false.

(p \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr): This term is true only when p, q are true and r is false.\n2. (\u00acp \u2227 q): True only when p is false and q is true, regardless of r.\n3. (p \u2228 r): True whenever p or r or both are true.\n\nFor the output \"O\" to be \"-\", the entire expression must be false, so all three terms must be false. Thus, we need:\n1.

Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38;\n2. Replace entity constants a in \ud835\udc35 with a\u2032;\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with g\ud835\udc3d;\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\n\nThe resulting formula is denoted as \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3d, termed as the implementation of \ud835\udc35 under \ud835\udc3d.\n\n### Question:\n(a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n(b) a\u2032 = 0.\n(c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n(d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nWrite down the implementation of the following formulas under J:\n\u2203xF(f(x,x),g(x,x))\n\nPlease provide the answer in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the conditions and the logical rule outlined, we can translate the formula under the interpretation \ud835\udc3d as follows:\n\nThe formula before interpretation: \u2203xF(f(x,x),g(x,x))\n\n1. The entity set \ud835\udc38 is the set of natural numbers N.\n2. Entity constant replacement is not directly applicable as there are no specific constants in the given formula.\n3. Replace function symbols with their respective implementations in \ud835\udc39:\n   - Replace f with f\ud835\udc3d which is addition (+).\n   - Replace g with g\ud835\udc3d which is multiplication (*).\n4. There are no predicate symbols directly to replace in the outermost formula for \ud835\udc39, but we need to pay attention to how they are used internally.\n\nThe formula, therefore, becomes:\n\u2203x F((f\ud835\udc3d(x,x)), (g\ud835\udc3d(x,x)))\n\nSubstituting the values for f\ud835\udc3d and g\ud835\udc3d:\n\u2203x F((x + x), (x * x))\n\nThe predicate F\ud835\udc3d(x, y) denotes x = y. However, in this case, since F is used to encapsulate the structure of the formula rather than directly acting as a predicate between two terms, the notation simply suggests the application of terms defined by f\ud835\udc3d and g\ud835\udc3d.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the given formula under \ud835\udc3d is:\n\n[\u2203x F((x + x), (x * x))]"}

However, this relationship does not stipulate any constraints that both propositions cannot be true, cannot be false, or must necessarily be in any exclusive state relative to truth or falsity as all four relationships imply differently. Since there is no inherent restriction on the possible truth values listed in the definitions of the * and x relationships, and it does not strictly necessitate that at least one of them must be true as per the @ relationship, it stands that the only defined relationship in our rule set that allows for both propositions to potentially be true and false is the % relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[D]]."}

Hence, Fp and \u00acG\u00acp.\n\nFor the second pair:\n3. \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" can be represented as Gp, indicating a future period.\n4. \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\" can be more loosely understood as Fp, a future point in time.\n\nNext, we match these interpretations to the given relationships to determine which one they fulfill:\n\nFor (1) - (2) relationships:\n- Fp and \u00acG\u00acp correspond to the relationship Gp \u2194 \u00acF\u00acp (which is rule 15). Therefore, they are related as in the rule (15).\n- Since the rules given do not provide an exact match for this derived relationship, we examine the complex relationships (\u203b, \u21a6, \u26ad, \u2042).\n\nSince Fp \u2194 \u00acG\u00acp does not directly tell us the type of relationship between Fp and \u00acG\u00acp, we can infer that Fp and \u00acG\u00acp follow the properties of the relationship between Fp and G\u00acp, which is not covered under the standards given directly. However, when considering the principles of (13) Gp \u2194 F\u00acp and by negation relationships, we deduce the contradicting but possible truth yet impossible falsity which points to a \u26ad relationship.\n\nFor (3) - (4) relationships:\n- Gp and Fp fall under the rule (21) Gp \u2192 Fp, which also indicates a future time point relationship. A bidirectional relationship not directly given but aligned with the future time points relationship among properties that can both be true or false, adhering to the nature of the future propositions which can lead to multiple interpretations but fits better within the type that does not state mutual exclusion (nor implies mutuality) fully but gives grounds to the truth and falsehood under posteriority or simultaneity which is \u2242 relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be:\n\n[[C];[D]]\n\nHowever, given the tight logical relationships and their persistence rules from the provided instructions, aligning the sentence to the rule should indeed overtly lean towards specific designation under which the direct match is needed. If no direct match, the best understood fit with given options married with deduced logical validity suggests the nature of properties.\n\nHence, considering the overarching principles [[C];[D]] gives the inferred relationship from available options aligning most logically."}

Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the conditions:\n- Proposition `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, implying `G_p`.\n- Alice (`i`) doubts the proposition `p`, implying `H_ip`.\n\nAccording to the Logic Rule and particularly the Definition of Common Belief, if `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then every member of the group `G` believes `p`, denoted as `B_ip` for every member `i` in the group. \n\nHowever, if Alice doubts `p`, it implies `H_ip`, from which we can derive `\u00acB_ip` by the Introduction of Doubt axiom (`H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`).\n\nTherefore, this scenario suggests a conflict: on one hand, `p` is supposed to be a common belief in `G` meaning Alice must believe `p`, and on the other hand, Alice doubts `p` and therefore does not believe `p`. \n\nGiven the problem statement, the logical expression that best represents the given situation in the context of the provided logical rule is:\n\n[[G_p \u2227 H_ip]]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the logical method consistent with the derivation of cause and effect in the passage, let's analyze the context provided:\n\nThe passage talks about the relationship between the number of deep wells, the amount of underground water used, and the rate of ground subsidence. It mentions specific years and the corresponding number of deep wells, water usage, and the level of subsidence. The claim is that as the number of deep wells increased and more water was extracted underground, the land subsided faster. This implies that there is a relationship where the intensity of the cause (number of wells and water extraction) is related to the effect (land subsidence).\n\nGiven these points, the logical method that fits best would be:\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of deep wells (S) and the use of underground water (S) changed over time, corresponding to changes in the level of land subsidence (P).\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n[[D]]"}

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)\u2227B(a) confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b) also confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- R(a)\u2227B(a)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\u2261\u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x))\n- \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nThe given expression ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5) conforms to the LS Paradox's structure. According to the LS Paradox, if the conjunction of reasonably accepted hypotheses (r_1 and r_2 in this case) leads to a contradiction (\u22a5), then there needs to be a reassessment of the reasonableness of these hypotheses. The expression represents a scenario where the logical consequence of accepting both hypotheses leads to a contradiction, which aligns with the definition and rules of the LS Paradox."}

Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
