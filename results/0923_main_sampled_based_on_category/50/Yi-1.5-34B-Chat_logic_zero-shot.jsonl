Then, we'll analyze which assignments make the formula false based on the rules provided.\n\n1. **Formula (1):** (~(~p1 & p2) || ~p3)\n   - This is a Level C Formula, with logical connectives \"not\", \"and\", and \"or\".\n   - To find the falsity values, we need to identify when the formula is false. The formula is false when the entire expression evaluates to \"x\".\n   - The formula is false when (~p1 & p2) is true and ~p3 is false, which results in (p1 & p2 & p3).\n   - The falsity value is therefore: [F: \u2713|\u2713|\u2713].\n\n2. **Formula (2):** (~p2 || p3) & (p1 =::> p2)\n   - This is also a Level C Formula, with logical connectives \"not\", \"and\", and \"or\", as well as an \"if...then\" statement.\n   - To find the falsity values, we need to identify when the formula is false. The formula is false when (~p2 || p3) is false or when (p1 =::> p2) is false, but not both, since the formula is the conjunction of these two parts.\n   - The first part, (~p2 || p3), is false when p2 is true and p3 is false, which gives us [F: x|\u2713|x].\n   - The second part, (p1 =::> p2), is false when p1 is true and p2 is false, which gives us [F: \u2713|x|x].\n   - Since the formula requires one of these two parts to be false, both falsity values are valid for the entire formula.\n   - The falsity values are therefore: [F: x|\u2713|x], [F: \u2713|x|x].\n\n3. **Formula (3):** (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n   - This is a Level C Formula, with logical connectives \"not\", \"and\", \"or\", and \"if...then\".\n   - To find the falsity values, we need to identify when the formula is false.

(p>(p|q))&r\n\n1. Apply the equivalence (10): p > q ::= ! p | q to the sub-expression p > (p | q), which becomes ! p | (p | q).\n2. Apply the equivalence (4): (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C) to the sub-expression ! p | (p | q), which simplifies to ! p | p | q.\n3. Apply the equivalence (7): A | (A & B) ::=:: A to simplify ! p | p, which is always true (1), so we can simplify that part to 1.\n4. The expression now is 1 | q & r, which, by the nature of OR and AND operations, keeps the AND part as it is, due to the identity A | 1 ::=:: 1. The simplified expression is effectively just the original AND part, as the OR with a true condition is dominant, but we retain the original for the AND part: q & r.\n\n### Expression 2: p&(((p|q)&! p)>q)\n\n1. First, simplify the sub-expression (p|q)&! p. This uses the equivalence (6): ! (A & B) ::=:: ! A | ! B, applied to ! ((p|q)&! p), which becomes ! (p|q) | p.\n2. Next, apply the equivalence (6) again to ! (p|q), which becomes ! p & ! q.\n3. Now, we have the sub-expression simplified to (! p & ! q) | p.\n4. Apply the equivalence (10): A > B ::=:: ! A | B to the entire expression's core, ((p|q)&! p) > q, which, substituting our simplified sub-expression, becomes (! p & ! q) | p > q.\n5. Apply the equivalence (10) again, inside the parentheses, to ! q > ! ((! p & ! q) | p), which flips to: ! ! q & ! (! (! p & ! q) | p), simplifies to q & ((! p & ! q) | p) by the double negation.\n6. Given our goal is to simplify to `|`, `&`, and `!`, we recognize that multiplying by q through the AND operation keeps the structure of the OR part but doesn't simplify further with immediate identities given. The focus here is to simplify the complex nested structure into something manageable by the rules given, ideally to just express its nature truthfully under the constraints of our basic operations.\n\n### Final Simplifications and Comparison\n\nFor Expression 1, we simplified to `q & r`.\n\nFor Expression 2, the simplification process led us to `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`, which, given the complexity in fully simplifying the OR part due to the nested structure and no direct simplification identity to reduce `((! p & ! q) | p)` further to a simple form using only `|`, `&`, and `!`, suggests that any further simplification would involve problem-specific logical deductions not solely based on the basic equivalences but how `p` and `q` relate in context, which the basic rules alone don't fully simplify to a basic `|`, `&`, and `!` structure without retaining some complexity in the OR component.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expressions, focusing strictly on the operation to `|`, `&`, and `!`, with the understanding that Expression 2 retains a form that is simplified under the strict application of the given logical equivalences to the point it doesn't simplify further under these basic rules to a form equally simple in composition as Expression 1 in terms of removing the `>` and `=` in favor of `|`, `&`, and `!`, are represented as:\n\n- Expression 1: `q & r`\n- Expression 2: `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`\n\nGiven the format `[[];[]]`, the answer is: [`q & r`; `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`]."}

Here, $A$ is $p$ and $B$ is either $q$ or $!q$:\n\n1. $(p & q) | (p & q) ::=:: p & q$\n2. $(p & !q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p & !q$\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equivalence as:\n\n\\[ p ::=:: (p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p & q | p & !q \\]\n\nThis simplifies directly by the distribution of $p$, using equivalence (5):\n\n\\[ p = (p & q) | (p & !q) = (p | p) & (q | !q) = p & (q | !q) = p & 1 = p \\]\n\nSo, equivalence (1) is effectively correct because $p = p$ is always true, which adheres to equivalence (8), stating $A | !A ::=:: 1$, implying $p | !p = 1$, and thus $p$ simplifies to itself under the conditions given.\n\n**For equivalence (2):**\n\n\\[ (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q)) \\]\n\nWe can first analyze the right side of the equivalence:\n\n\\[ (p | q) & (!(p | q)) \\]\n\nAccording to equivalence (6), $!(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B$, so:\n\n\\[ !(p | q) = !p & !q \\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[ (p | q) & (!p & !q) \\]\n\nNow, using equivalence (5), $A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)$, where $A = (p | q)$, $B = !p$, and $C = !q$, we get:\n\n\\[ (p | q) & !p | (p | q) & !q \\]\n\nGiven the structure we're comparing, let's directly assess its equivalency step:\n\n1. Start with the original: $(p & !q) | (!p & q)$.\n2. Rearrange using (3) for clarity, though it's already in a form that directly matches through decomposition:\n   - $(p | !p) & (q | !q) & (!p | p) & (!q | q)$ simplifies via (8) and (9) to $1 & 1 = 1$, which is not directly comparable to the structure of the right side without explicit distribution that leads to a form not easily matching $(p | q) & (!p & !q)$ due to the nature of how distribution over the initial terms $(p & !q)$ and $(!p & q)$ doesn't directly map to $(p | q) & !(p | q)$ without violating the scope of direct application of the equivalences in a straightforward manner.\n\nHowever, the direct assessment shows that the distribution and simplification do not map the left side directly to the structure of the right side in a manner that's intuitively or directly through simple application of the given equivalences to the form $(p | q) & (!(p | q))$. The correct interpretation involves recognizing that the initial formulation of the left side, through any direct simplification, does not lead to a match with the right side's structure without deeply embedding into the logic of NAND or NOR operations implicit in the behavior of negating an OR operation directly through De Morgan's, which isn't directly cited in the simplifications allowed.\n\nGiven the structure and the aim to match $(p | q) & (!(p | q))$ through direct logical simplification from $(p & !q) | (!p & q)$ without deeply engaging in the implicit transformation via De Morgan's to directly compare the negation of the OR through AND operations directly specified, the equivalences provided do not straightforwardly confirm the equivalence without engaging in a deeper, non-explicitly-allowed transformation.\n\nTherefore, for the strict application of the provided basic equivalences to directly confirm or refute the equivalence:\n\n**The answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;. The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].**\n\nGiven the limitation in directly confirming the equivalence through the strictly provided basic equivalences without engaging in a deeper, non-explicitly-approved transformation for direct simplification:\n\n**Answer: [B];[B]** (indicating \"No\" for both, as the direct application of simplifications provided does not confirm the equivalence given the form of the second statement and the constraints on transformation)."}

For \\(n = 4\\), this number is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n**Being a Basic Formula:**\nA formula is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\), which corresponds to the truth assignment where all propositional variables are false. In terms of our notation and the given rule, this means including the paired conjunctive term that represents the hexadecimal number 0, which is \\(m_0\\) in binary form (since \\(0_{16}\\) in binary is \\(0000\\), and \\(m_0\\) corresponds to this binary representation).\n\n**Being an All-Even Formula:**\nA formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have indices that are even. In the context of hexadecimal numbers used to denote these terms (where \\(m_i\\) or \\(M_i\\) corresponds to hexadecimal numbers), an even index translates directly to the binary representation ending in an even number of 1s. This is because even hexadecimal numbers (except zero) in binary start with 1 and have an even number of 0s following (or are 0 itself, which in binary is \\(0000\\)).\n\n**Intersection of Basic and All-Even Forms:**\nFor a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must include \\(m_0\\) (corresponding to the all-false assignment) and no other terms except those with even indices in their hexadecimal to binary correspondences.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables:\n- The only form that includes \\(m_0\\) and satisfies the all-even condition without including any other paired conjunctive terms (to adhere to the definition of being both a basic and an all-even formula simultaneously) is \\(m_0\\) itself. This is because including any other term, either from odd-indexed paired conjunctive terms (which would violate the all-even condition) or from even-indexed terms beyond \\(m_0\\) (which are necessarily included due to their pairing in the binary/hexadecimal scheme and the need to exclude all others for the formula to be basic), would contradict the criteria of being a basic or an all-even formula.\n\nThus, the only formula that satisfies both conditions is one that essentially represents the disjunction with no variable truth assignments beyond the all-false case, which is distinctly represented by \\(m_0\\). There are no other formulas under 4 propositional variables that can simultaneously be both a basic form and an all-even form due to the exclusivity of the conditions when applied strictly to their definitions as outlined.\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form with 4 propositional variables is 1.\n\n### Answer:\n[1]"}

The format reflects the attempt to fully resolve the question's direct request into a single, straightforward output matching the expected output format for a resolution result, acknowledging the context of the resolution algorithm's iterative process. \n\nFor clarity in a strictly defined logical output as requested and given the immediate operation, the focus is on illustrating the direct application of the resolution step rather than the full algorithm's broader, iterative contradiction search or simplification towards \"Plausible\" or \"Implausible\" conclusions."}

Identify relevant properties and objects:\n   - Proposition 1 (p): A person can pull their own hair.\n   - Proposition 2 (q): A person can leave the earth.\n   - Necessity (#) and Possibility ($): Implied relationships.\n\n2. Apply the logical operations:\n   - The statement asserts that a person cannot necessarily do both actions (pulling their own hair and leaving the earth) simultaneously. This means that it is not necessarily true that both actions occur.\n   - We can express this situation with the negation of the necessity for both actions to occur together: !#(p + q).\n\n3. Find the corresponding truth-value modal reasoning formula:\n   - The given statement corresponds to an assertion that it is not necessary for both propositions to be true at the same time. This does not directly match one of the provided formulas but can be related to the idea that if something is not necessarily true, its opposite could be considered possible. Therefore, we look for a formula that best captures this nuance.\n   - Formula (9) #p \u2192 $p comes closest in the sense that if something is necessarily possible, then it is just plainly possible. However, to directly align with the given scenario, we need to adjust our understanding of the relationship between # and $ as described in the Four Modal Proposition Relationships. Specifically, relationship (1) applies where #p and $\u00acp cannot both be true or false, indicating a strict separation between necessity and possibility for the same proposition.\n   - Given the structure of the initial scenario involves the interplay of two actions (pulling hair and leaving the earth) rather than a single proposition's necessity and possibility, we need to focus on how the negation of necessity intertwines with possibility. The closest conceptual match in the operations and relations provided, considering the interplay and the negation involved, is more aligned with understanding the implications of necessity and possibility relationships as outlined but not directly matched by the numbered formulas.\n\nHowever, the direct inference from \"A person cannot necessarily pull their own hair and leave the earth\" to \"A person cannot possibly pull their own hair and leave the earth\" isn't straightforward from the provided formulas as structured. The inference involves a shift from negating necessity to asserting impossibility, which is a stronger claim than merely stating what is possible. \n\nGiven the structure and the aim to find a direct match or the most conceptually aligned formula from the provided, the process involves inferring a stronger claim (from not necessarily true to impossible) which doesn't have a direct numerical match in the provided modal logic inference formulas. \n\n### Answer:\nWhile the question aims to find a direct match from the provided formulas, the inference and its alignment to the given logical operations and relationships highlight a nuance not directly encapsulated by the listed modal logic inference formulas. The closest conceptual alignment in the context of discussing the interplay between necessity and possibility without a direct numerical match suggests a recursive application of the principles, especially around negation and the implications of necessity (#) and possibility ($):\n\n- The inference from \"cannot necessarily\" to \"cannot possibly\" involves a leap from negating necessity (#) to asserting impossibility (which can be seen as !$, given that \"cannot possibly\" negates \"possible\").\n\nGiven the focus on finding a formula that corresponds to the direct inference asked in the question, the exercise underscores the need for a formula that explicitly bridges the negation of necessity to the assertion of impossibility in a single step, which is not directly provided in the list. \n\n### Answer (Approximate conceptual match):\n[[(1)]]$ - This is not a direct match but conceptually, the transformation from necessity to possibility in the context asked, considering the aim to find a closest principle, indirectly involves recognizing that if something is not necessarily possible (negating the necessity of the conjunction), it implies a different level of possibility discourse, which, while not formulaically matched in the provided, conceptually aligns with exploring the implications of # and $ relationships and their negations. The closest practical application would be related to how negations interplay with # and $, guiding toward understanding the implications rather than a direct numerical [[number]] match."}

This means that when the first statement (Gp - Ap) is true, the negation of the second statement (A\u00acp - Hp) cannot be true.\n\nSo, for the second sentence, the relationship is A. \u203b Relationship.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given that proposition `p` is the consensus of the group `G`, we can write this as `G_p`. According to the definition of common belief, if `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nHowever, it's stated that the individual Alice doubts this proposition, which can be represented as `H_p`.\n\nFrom the Axioms of Doubt, specifically the Introduction of Doubt, we know that `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`. This means that if Alice doubts the proposition `p`, she does not firmly believe `p`.\n\nSince `G_p` implies that every member, including Alice, believes `p`, and we have `H_p` for Alice, we encounter a contradiction according to the Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`.\n\nHowever, to directly address the question without contradiction (assuming we are not violating the given that `G_p`, which is a simplification for problem-solving here), the logical expression that can be written according to the definition of consensus, considering Alice's doubt, would focus on her relationship with the group's consensus. Given the structure of the cognitive logic model and the axioms, specifically her doubt not aligning with the group's common belief, we can express this as a violation of what would be expected from `G_p` due to her doubt.\n\nThus, the logical expression, focusing on the expected common belief and the introduced doubt by Alice, can be represented as a contradiction or inconsistency in the belief system for Alice given the group's consensus:\n\n`G_p` and `H_p` lead to `\u22a5` (Contradiction)\n\nIn symbolic format, this can be written as:\n\n`[G_p, H_p] \u2192 \u22a5`\n\nThis expression captures the scenario where Alice's doubt of `p` introduces a logical inconsistency given the group's consensus on `p`. It highlights the interaction between the collective belief of the group and the individual doubt, leading to a contradiction in the cognitive logic model for Alice's beliefs."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "C"}

According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]"}
