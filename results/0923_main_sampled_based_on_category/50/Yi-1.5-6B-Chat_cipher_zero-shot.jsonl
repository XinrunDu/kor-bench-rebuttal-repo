The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\" using the given cipher rules, we follow the steps outlined in the encryption rules.\n\n1. **Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters.** Since the plaintext only has one character, \"G\", it is considered a single character block.\n\n2. **Determine the grid for the current block.** For a single-character block, the block number \\(i = 0\\). So, we calculate the grid index as \\(grid\\_index = (0 // 5) \\mod 8\\). Since \\(0 // 5 = 0\\), and \\(0 \\mod 8 = 0\\), we use the first grid for encryption.\n\n3. **Encrypt the character \"G\" using the selected grid.** Grid 0 starts with the characters:\n   ```\n   Grid0: | P | H | I | L | S | ...\n   ```\n   The character \"G\" is not in this grid, so it is treated as is and added to the encrypted block. Therefore, the encrypted block is:\n   ```\n   Encrypted block: G\n   ```\n\n4. **Connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.** Since there's only one character, no further connection is needed.\n\nThe encrypted plaintext is \"G\" itself, as \"G\" is not encrypted according to the rules.\n\nTherefore, the answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n```\n[[G]]\n```"}

That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"PR\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Moving one grid to the upper left from (0, 0) results in (-1, -1), which is outside the grid. In a wrap-around manner, this would be equivalent to (4, 4), which corresponds to letter \"K\".\n   - The position of \"R\" in Grid0 is (1, 0). Moving one grid to the upper left from (1, 0) results in (0, 4), which corresponds to letter \"S\".\n\n4. **Decrypted Block:** \"KS\"\n\n5. **Final Decrypted Message:** \"KS\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n```\n[[KS]]\n```"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"EV\" and following the encryption rules, let's encrypt the text step by step.\n\n1. **Cleaning up the plaintext:** The plaintext \"EV\" is already in uppercase letters and does not have any spaces or non-alphabetic characters. No changes are needed.\n\n2. **Adjusting for odd length:** The plaintext is of odd length (2 letters), so we add a letter 'X' to make it of even length. Now, the plaintext is \"EVX\".\n\n3. **Splitting into double-letter groups:** The plaintext is already in double letters, so we directly proceed to step 4.\n\n4. **Using the Girds for encryption:**\n   - In Gird1 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'E') and Gird4 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'V'), we find the letters in the respective positions marked by arrows.\n   - In Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters corresponding to these two positions marked by arrows.\n\n   Plaintext: | **E** | **V**\n               | (1,1) | (3,2)\n               | **↑**  | **↑** \n\n   Gird1:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n   Gird2:    | E  C  H  O  A | B  D  F  G  I | J  K  L  M  N | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z |\n   Gird3:    | V  O  R  T  E | X  A  B  C  D | F  G  H  I  J | K  L  M  N  P | S  U  W  Y  Z |\n   Gird4:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n\n   - From Gird1 and Gird4, the positions of 'E' and 'V' are (1,1) and (3,2) respectively. Corresponding to these positions in Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters 'K' and 'X'.\n\n5. **Concatenating:** The encrypted double-letter group is \"KX\".\n\n6. **Final ciphertext:** The final ciphertext, after encrypting the double-letter group \"EV\", is \"KX\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[KX]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"IX\" using the provided rules, we will follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. **Input**: Ciphertext: \"IX\"\n2. **Preparation**: Four 5x5 grids are the same as the encryption.\n3. **Decryption Steps**:\n    - Clean up the ciphertext: \"IX\" doesn't contain spaces or non-alphabetic characters, and we don't need to add 'X' as it's already of even length.\n    - Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups: We have \"IX\", which is already a two-letter group.\n    - For the double-letter group \"IX\" of the ciphertext:\n        - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter 'I' and the second letter 'X'.\n        - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these positions.\n          - The position of 'I' in Gird2 is (0, 2).\n          - The position of 'X' in Gird1 is (4, 0).\n  \nGiven these positions, we look at the corresponding letters in the grids:\n- Gird2[0,2] (row 0, column 2) is 'A'.\n- Gird1[4,0] (row 4, column 0) is 'K'.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the process. The decryption steps as described don't directly match the grids because the positions calculated (0,2 for 'I' and 4,0 for 'X') are out of the grid's range. This indicates that the decryption process might be looking for the underlying letters rather than the specific positions within a grid that doesn't directly correspond to the ciphertext letters 'I' and 'X'.\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"IX\" and the decryption rules, the correct decryption involves finding the letters in the grids that correspond to the letters 'I' and 'X' directly.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we will follow the encryption rules step-by-step for the plaintext \"KN\". \n\n1. **Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.**\n   - The input plaintext is \"KN\". After removing spaces and punctuation, it remains \"KN\". Since all characters are already capital letters, no further conversion is needed.\n\n2. **Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters:**\n   - The plaintext is now hardcoded as it has been converted to \"KN\" which is only 2 characters long, so we pad it with \"#\" to make it a group of 6 characters. Therefore, we have \"N#N#\".\n   - This will be cut into 2 groups of 6 characters each, so we have \"N#N#N#\".\n\n3. **Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.**\n   - We have \"N#N#N#\", which we split into \"NNN#N#N#\". This gives us 2 binary groups, \"NNN\" and \"#N#\".\n\n4. **For each binary group (L1, L2) do the following:**\n   - For \"NNN\":\n     - Determine the row number of \"N\" in `grid1` (3x9). The row numbers are (0,1,2). So, `l1_row` (L1 row number) is 2.\n     - Determine the column number of \"N\" in `grid2` (9x3). The column numbers are (0,1,2). So, `l2_col` (L2 col number) is 0.\n     - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` (3x3) from 2 and 0, which is (5,0). The corresponding number is 5.\n   - For \"#N#\":\n     - Determine the row number of \"#\" in `grid1` (3x9). There is no row \"#\" in `grid1`. We consider the row below \"N\", which is 3. So, `l1_row` (L1 row number) is 3.\n     - Determine the column number of \"N\" in `grid2` (9x3). The column number for \"N\" is (0,1,2). So, `l2_col` (L2 col number) is 1.\n     - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` (3x3) from 3 and 1, which is (6,2). The corresponding number is 6.\n\n5. **Output the triples (l1_col, num3, l2_row) of the three numbers.**\n   - For \"NNN#N#N#\":\n     - The triples are (4, 5, 0) and (0, 6, 2).\n\n6. **After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information.**\n   - The encrypted information is the concatenation of the numbers from the triples: 450062.\n\n### Answer:\n```\n[[450062]]\n```"}

According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"RWALHVXZEEZ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the ciphertext \"WBWBMBGIBBGHMHBEGTGEKB,\" we will follow the decryption steps provided in the rules to decrypt it.\n\nDecryption Steps:\n1. Take two letters c1, c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n2. The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row where c1 is the row header.\n3. The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n4. Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1, c2 decrypted message p.\n\nLet's decrypt the ciphertext:\n\n1. c1 = W, c2 = B\n   - W is the row header of the 4th row.\n   - B is the bottom of the 4th row. This doesn't match any letter, so we move to the next pair.\n\n2. c1 = B, c2 = W\n   - B is the row header of the 1st row.\n   - W is the bottom of the 1st row. This doesn't match any letter, so we move to the next pair.\n\n3. c1 = W, c2 = B\n   - W is the row header of the 4th row.\n   - B is the bottom of the 4th row. This matches the 3rd letter in the grid, which is G.\n   So, GW decrypted to G.\n\n4. Continue this process for the entire ciphertext:\n\n   WBWBMBGIBBGHMHBEGTGEKB -> GWBMBGIBGHMHBEGTGEKB -> GKBMBGIGHHMHEGTGEKB -> GKJBGIGIOHMHEGTGEKB -> GKJDOHIMHMHEGTGEKB -> GKJDOHIBEWTGEKB -> GKJDOHIBEGHKB -> GKJDOHIB\n\nThe decrypted message is \"GKJDOHIB.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[GKJDOHIB]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\", let's apply the specified encryption rules step by step to obtain the encrypted message.\n\nFirst, we divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters each:\n- \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nSince the length of the plaintext is 16 letters, we only have one block. Now, we'll follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. **Filling the Grid and Rotating the Template:**\n   - Place the template on a blank grid with the holes aligned.\n   - Start filling the grid with the letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the template.\n   - After filling the first letter, rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n\n2. **Repeating the Filling and Rotation Process:**\n   - Continue filling the grid with the next letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the rotated template.\n   - Rotate the template again after each fill until the grid is completely filled. If the message is shorter than 16 letters, fill the remaining positions with filler characters (e.g., '#').\n\n3. **Reading the Grid:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line.\n   - This will give us the encrypted message for that block.\n\nGiven the complexity of the operation and the need to visualize the grid and template movements, I'll demonstrate the encryption process with the first few letters:\n\n- **First Letter (K):** Place 'K' in the top-left hole of the template and fill it. Rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n- **Second Letter (G):** Place 'G' in the first hole of the next row, filling it. Rotate again.\n- **Continuing this process:** Continue placing letters and rotating until the grid is filled.\n\nAfter following these steps for the entire plaintext, we get the following encrypted grid:\n\n```\n[\n  ['N', 'R', 'P', 'Z'],\n  ['I', 'D', 'F', 'G'],\n  ['O', 'A', 'K', 'H'],\n  ['F', 'V', 'X', 'E']\n]\n```\n\nNow, read the contents of the grid line by line to get the encrypted message: \"NIRPZIDFGIOAKHFVXE\"\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n```\n[[NIRPZIDFGIOAKHFVXE]]\n```"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"DGVX\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"DGVX\" according to the given rules, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"DG\" and \"VX\".\n2. For each decryption binary, translate the number of rows and columns back to the corresponding character in the 6x6 matrix.\n3. Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\nLet's start with the first binary, \"DG\".\n\n**For \"D\"**\n- The position of \"D\" in the encrypted character set is 0, which corresponds to the row 0 in the matrix.\n- The matrix row 0 contains the characters ['R', 'U', 'A', '0 ', 'Q', 'B']. The character at position 0 (counting from 0) is 'R'.\n- So, \"D\" decrypts to \"R\".\n\n**For \"G\"**\n- The position of \"G\" in the encrypted character set is 2, which corresponds to the column 2 in the matrix.\n- The matrix column 2 contains the characters ['U', 'A', '0 ', 'Q', 'B']. The character at position 2 (counting from 0) is 'A'.\n- So, \"G\" decrypts to \"A\".\n\nNow we have two decrypted characters: \"R\" and \"A\".\n\nNext, we move to the second part of the ciphertext, \"VX\".\n\n**For \"V\"**\n- The position of \"V\" in the encrypted character set is 4, which corresponds to the row 4 in the matrix.\n- The matrix row 4 contains the characters ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7 ', 'L']. The character at position 4 (counting from 0) is 'X'.\n- So, \"V\" decrypts to \"X\".\n\n**For \"X\"**\n- The position of \"X\" in the encrypted character set is 2, which corresponds to the column 2 in the matrix.\n- The matrix column 2 contains the characters ['U', 'A', '0 ', 'Q', 'B']. The character at position 2 (counting from 0) is 'A'.\n- So, \"X\" decrypts to \"A\".\n\nNow we have two more decrypted characters: \"X\" and \"A\".\n\nFinally, concatenate all the decrypted characters: \"RAXA\".\n\nThe decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[RAXA]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's break down the given ciphertext and the encryption/decryption process step by step, applying the decryption rules as described:\n\nGiven Ciphertext: \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\"\n\n1. **Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal string back to bytes.\n\n2. **Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise XOR operation:**\n   - The key is the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\" which we'll assume is provided as '73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 ' (but since this is a simulated scenario, we'll use the actual SHA-256 hash value for confidentiality).\n   - Each byte of the ciphertext is XORed with the corresponding byte of the key.\n\n3. **The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string:**\n   - The resulting bytes are concatenated and converted back to uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nLet's decrypt the ciphertext:\n\nGiven Ciphertext: \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\"\n\nAnd the Key (SHA-256 hash): '73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 '\n\n1. Convert Ciphertext to bytes:\n   - \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\" becomes [0x27, 0xb8, 0x73, 0x03, 0x8, 0xe2, 0x02, 0x7, 0xf8, 0x5, 0xfb, 0xa0, 0xb]\n\n2. Decryption using the key:\n   - For each byte of the key, XOR with the corresponding byte of ciphertext.\n   - Key bytes: [0x73, 0xef, 0x2a, 0xed, 0xda, 0xfb, 0xf0, 0xf6, 0xfa, 0xf9, 0x96, 0x74, 0xdc, 0xc2, 0x5a, 0x02, 0xfd, 0x74, 0xc2, 0x21, 0xf4, 0xc3, 0x58, 0x49, 0xe5, 0xc0, 0xfB3]\n   - Calculate the decrypted bytes:\n     - 0x27 XOR 0x73 = 0x5a\n     - 0xb8 XOR 0xef = 0x7f\n     - ...\n     - 0xb XOR 0xfB3 = 0x8b\n   - Decrypted bytes: [0x5a, 0x7f, 0x6f, 0x19, 0x1, 0x3f, 0x64, 0x28, 0x43, 0x2, 0x6d, 0x5c, 0x4c, 0x7f, 0x9b, 0x10, 0x8c, 0x1f, 0x82, 0x27, 0x65, 0x43, 0x9d, 0xdf, 0x76, 0x1f, 0xfb]\n\n3. Convert Decrypted bytes back to plaintext:\n   - Plaintext: \"ZOFQIDWXVWQCPVIQKXXZIBVNLCUCXCAQPVV\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n[[ZOFQIDWXVWQCPVIQKXXZIBVNLCUCXCAQPVV]]"}
