It is important to ensure that the keywords do not contain repetitive patterns and that they do not overlap significantly. The longer the keyword, the more effective the encryption will be, but it is still possible to detect and crack even larger ciphertexts with modern techniques.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

The Pahlavi alphabet introduced a new quasi-consonantal -a vowel sign for the long front vowel ā, as well as a retroflex vowel sign -ʦ for ʦ, and a three-bar rule for placing vowels above and below consonants \"\"\"\n\n# pip3 install khomeini\nfrom khomeini import Pahlavi, DePersian, Persian\nnum_text = 'نصف قانون‌ها کاش رضایی آنها و رأي اوامر رضا که در طول تولد خود بیان شود احب شناسی براساس کاش غرره بود قیصرفه رضا آثارش برای من ها در طول اجتنابی اولین تخصیص رضا بر شرایط مسیر زمین در آزمار او کشف شد اما چراغ‌طلا رآبرای ˘ هیچ ابجکت سخت نیست هرچنقه ناپدید می شود احکام رضا آثارش در قوم پدری را برای حکومتان نشان می دهد خوب آن کار او در سخنرانی و اصلاحات با چشم رضا برایت آزاد شد باز این خوب کاملا تموم شد در حین خواندن سخنرانی و اصلاحات جلی دعوت پذیرایت شد پونای رضا در آزادی خود از موجودات بر اساس جنگ دودی آزاد شد چشم رضا از این پونه سرجوشی در در رابطه با بیگ و چنگالاسما یک چشم رضا را به سراشی B‌یافت که برای دعوت تموم شد پونه من را جنگلا K‌یافت در آزادی آن وز شد چهانگوشش رضا در آزادی به صورت گویایی دست؛ زنه‌بندان تموم شده اوست غواصت توی عرق سرجوشی در آزادی چشم رضا و بادبزن صدا نزد لوح رضاد و هفت تا زنه‌بندان رضاد پنجاه سالم بین خود تا دعوت آزاد شد انها به وجود آمدن رضا ربوت اثر ملا صدس در ظاهرات رضا باوجود سرمایش رضا ان آنها همچنان ذخیره شده می‌گردوند و داخل فرازمین در صفحه ذخیره ان آنها ایستاده است پس از آن مشکل خالق رضا باجایت آنها در می آورد. \"\"\"\n\n# print(num_text.replace(\"چشم \",'ی'))\n\n# print(num_text)\n# pl = DePersian(num_text)[15].jad9s\n# pl = DePersian(num_text)\n\n# max_len = min(len(pl), len(us))\n# ch = False\n# pl = pl[:max_len]\n# us = us[:max_len]\n# max_len = sum([len(i)+2 for i in pl])\n# plm = max_len\n\nfor i,j in enumerate(us):\n    if us[i]['shortened'] and j == '҃':\n        us[i]['shortened'] = False\n        print(i)\n    elif us[i]['shortened'] and not j =='҃':\n        us[i]['shortened'] = False\n        us[i - 1]['shortened'] = True\n        print(i)\n\nfor i,j in enumerate(us):\n    if us[i]['shortened']==True:\n        continue\n    elif us[i]['encrypted']=='҃:':\n        continue\n    elif us[i]['encrypted']=='҂ł.҃:':\n        us[i]['e_type'] = 15\n        us[i]['encrypted'] = us[i]['file_text'][3:]\n    elif us[i]['encrypted']=='Ґ́łł.҂:':\n        us[i]['e_type'] = 5\n        us[i]['encrypted'] = us[i]['file_text'][3:]\n    elif us[i]['encrypted']=='҆́:':\n        us[i]['encrypted'] = us[i]['file_text'][1:]\n    elif us[i]['encrypted']=='ҏ́łłł̂:':\n        us[i]['e_type'] = 7\n        us[i]['"}

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This is consistent with the rules of the cipher, as A is mapped to D, and X is mapped to G. The decryption steps would be:\n1. A maps to the next letter D in Reel2 (encoded as 1).\n2. Follows the direction of the ciphertext, going to Reel9 (encoded as 2).\n3. X maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n4. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n5. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n6. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n7. J maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n8. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n9. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n10. Moves to Reel22 (encoded as 21).\n11. O maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n12. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n13. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n14. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n15. W maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n16. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n17. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n18. Moves to Reel20 (encoded as 19).\n19. N maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n20. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n21. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n22. Moves to Reel17 (encoded as 15).\n23. J maps to G in Reel10 (encoded as -2, meaning -2 for wraparound).\n24. Moves to Reel12 (encoded as +2).\n25. L maps to U in Reel19 (encoded as -1).\n26. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n27. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n28. Moves to Reel18 (encoded as 17).\n29. V maps to G in Reel17 (encoded as 0).\nThus, the decrypted answer is \"GU\".\n\nBecause this is not a computer program, I am unable to format the output in a specific way.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[./.]]\nBased on the information provided, here's a simplified version of the rules:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Blue: Prepare the morse_code Table and Numerical-Index Mapping Table.\n2. Blue: Take the plaintext and convert each character to its corresponding Morse code, adding a / between each character.\n3. Blue: Divide the Morse code into two pairs of characters. Convert them into their corresponding numeric strings using the Mapping Table.\n4. Purple: Join the numeric strings into a single string, adding an extra .. if the input text length is odd.\n5. Green: Divide the ciphertext into pairs of digits.\n6. Green: Convert each pair to its corresponding character pair using the Mapping Table.\n7. Green: Combine the character pairs to form the final morse_code, adding an extra / if the input ciphertext length is odd.\n8. Purple: Convert each character pair of morse_code to its Uppercase counterpart using the morse_code table.\n9. Green: Join the plaintext characters to form the final output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThese rules represent the simplified workflow of the cipher. The steps are clear and concise. However, for greater clarity and precision, adding the functions used to improve understanding can be helpful. For instance, a \"convert_morse\" function could be defined for step 9 (Purple) to demonstrate how the characters are converted back to their uppercase counterparts in the plaintext.\n\n### Rule Variations:\n\n1. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in decryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n2. The character i '.' maps directly to 7 in the decryption step, bypassing the numeric-index mapping table.\n3. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in encryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n4. Adding an additional step in the decryption process to handle the extra '/' symbol if the input ciphertext has an odd number of digits doesn't impact the accuracy of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Changes in Explanation:\n\n1. The rule variations no longer apply to the simplified rules, as they are beyond the scope of the simplification process.\n\nThe modified rules and explanation clarify the simplified workflow of the Keyword Exclusive _Tagram Cipher, while ensuring they adhere to the question restrictions."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
