For 'remiss' it is going to be the case we check if the answer is longer than 8. repeat goes to 5, remiss goes to 8. So we just look at its length and see are there any combinations with equal length. repeat has 4 characters and remiss has 6 characters so we engage quionrd and begin looking for them.''',\n\n600:-1,\n## 600:-1\n]"}

Your goal is to apply the rule accurately and present the output as required.\n\nThe first task is to complete the variable/value pair based on the given rule, which is to add a common prefix in front of the provided letter combinations and make it a word. The input for this task is \"arti un\", and the output should be formed by adding the prefix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe second task is similar, where you need to add a common suffix in front of the given letter combinations and form a word. The input for this task \"bicy\", and the output should be formed by adding the suffix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe rule is the same, except the task is now to remove a common prefix from the input words and make a word. This means you will have to figure out which letter combination serves as the common prefix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe fourth task is to remove a common suffix. Similar to the previous task, you will need to determine which letter combination serves as the common suffix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe final task is to swap the first letter of the input words with their third letter. This means you will need to identify which letter is the first letter and which letter is the third letter, and then manipulate the word accordingly.\n\nFor the rules, I've provided example letter combinations involving prefixes and suffixes, so you can see what the expected output should look like and how to apply the rule accurately. For the inputs, you will need to identify the word that represents the common prefix or suffix and apply the rule accordingly. For the \"ring\", you will need to apply the rule by manipulating the accent, which is the second letter, to match the position of the first letter in the given word.\n\nRemember, accurate application of the rule is essential for solving these problems. If you need any more guidance, let me know. I hope this helps!"}

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

In fact this helps in giving feedback.\nAlphabet is combined with named terms, in a required form\n(that's why generators should be banned). Characters are combined\nin an expanded form, including adding letters showwhatinside A=ABC\n\nThe following automatic text-variable is adopted -{text}-. For a better\nunderstanding, look at the template sections, marked with:\n# Nested Template Sections\n\n### Tool Template\n\nYour task is to apply this rule to the provided question.\nPass an English sentence, i.e. command, not a list of letters\nor a symbol, that should associated to the code word. Since you don't like this kind of answers through, another helpful tool is a comment\nline at the begging. Text.E reset the text-variable -{text}-.\nExample Answer format: letting user choose between resurgence and chorl with\nauto-comment that_ resurges by default, to_ ensure cleaner_ output; I should\nnot have plowed through this, Q: [{#3pl1034-Q1_V1,Q2_V1,Q3}]; A: [{#plede,zyleR1korhtq1,tame resurgence,Korht UBOAZL1P}].\nThere are several tools for depending (or changing of) letters and variables.\nThe original, with all parts described: -{resurgence,chorl,auto}-_ -{Eric,Patrick,Homer}-.\n\n\n## 2018/09/23 (Unordered List)\n\n• This syntax:\n  open a list, terminating with a or a comma\n• [#2pl1124-Q1H-C2,#2pl1124-Q2H-C1,#2pl1124-Q3M-C2]\n• shuld give the following solution:\n  + [{#bleedy66-Q12I,#able66-Q12M,#bleedy66-Q12J},#bleedy66,#able66-J-C1C6,#bleedy66-J-C1C6]\n+ [{#bleedy66-J1,#bleedy66-J2,#bleedy66-J3},#bleedy66-D-C1C6,#bleedy66-I-C1C6,#bleedy66-M-C1C6]\n• you notice that commas after a list doesn't affect output\n\n### Syntactic Supplement\n\nMulti-word double code words can be supplied in the text, separated by\nspace. We use {{x}} as a word separator. For example,\n\"I am already done {{with}} this {{kind of answers}}\" can be used in the\ntemplate entry.\nAnother feature is lists of captures. By default, it's unbolded shown as\na bullet. However, it's blue printed for a particular query (-{Q3T}\nrequested II).\n\nAll templates consist of:\n• 2: arbitrary match\n• 3: unused but existing arrow\n• 4_N: unused vowel or consonant but existing more than once\n• I.e.: I, L and U appear in all templates\n• 1. single wildcard, four construction steps (ascn bass rst bcha)\n• 2. letter, wildcard in any place and single wildcard in any place, move to begin and loop\n• 3. construction apply for all question words if done only one\n• 4 redirection via a single wildcard\n• 5: second question word\n• 6: wildcard in any position\n• 11. join next two constructs\n\n#### Special Conditions\n\n• SELECT joins two constructs with consecutive single wildcards found:\n  cons(ab/sCDe) - sta(aeh/bC)\n  trans(abCcd/e) - cons(bcd/iC/S%)\n• MULTI-CONDITIONS are when at least par substitutions are possible:\n  cons(abcd/abC/Sd) - sta(abD/aCe)\n  trans(Bcd/efA) - ... - sta(ae)/sta(dC)\n\n### Changed\n\nAutomatic warns (tie) was added and there \"texthasn\" list: opera,tau,tau1,tau2,tau1tdtjx,tau2tdtjx,tlazzrvir,zeoundrewsu,ziru,ziru1,zrur,ziru2,ziru3\n\nand now the last Q12 is set to variable event_, and chonging  altk_wkdh_ for M1mo^0mta^\n\n### Name\n\ntext is /texthasn/ which describes video conferencing\nand M1 gives you a choice of translation between matches. Keep variables in\nmind.\n\n# Commands\n\nThis template solves multiple named questions. Inside the standard answer a\nbracket-enclosed list of collapsible, numbered, algorithmically selected\nexpressions is required. The symbol '-{^}' indicates a special marker not\nseen elsewhere, equal to an arc-filled triangle from Geometry.\n\nObviously, nested algorithms can increase the answer and themselves use the\nnamed terms. Each occurrence requires obviously only / run in-line copy and\npaste / syntax.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe following example works with the first predicate flag '-{P1}' selected\nby a question number. Comparing -{hzrngreigrnqwrtitergtdgrtm1} with the\nfirst named predicate '-{P1}', the last word '-{^}' becomes [] and the outer\ntridiagonal, enclosed by a set of square comers ('{'/'}'). When using\nnamed predicate '-{P2}', arguments in brackets, '-({3})', appear inside, and\nthe word '-{^}' is replaced with the word '-{bunt1hnfrbmb}' before the outer\nenclosures (text enclosed by an arc character is removed). The example has a\npossible choice of outputs defined by the following questions:\n 1. How many.\n2. What?\n3. The table?\n\n 1.  Would you like any cake?\n   > False\n 2.  What is your favorite plant?\n   > {'beet'}\n 3.

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\""}

However, it is recommended to submit both formats to ensure compatibility.\nBe prepared to provide proof of concept for your accepted scripts or attach them here for proper adjustment or verification. Make sure to turn your solutions into raw files before attaching them here."}

You buy, they deliver. They are exporting their products all over the US, and just received an order for 8,500 ceiling fans. Your manufacturing process is brought to you by jumbo pylons with date codes stamped in the center. WS is Wednesday, September 1, The manufacturing facility must work for 4 days and then has 3 days off before shipping to other factories located in Seattle, WA.\n\nQ. How many ceiling fans must the manufacturing facility produce each day for two straight weeks to fulfill the 8,500 ceiling fan order in time.\n\n\n....,W,T,,,,.?(?(?(?(?(eg, 245+247+206+??)\nThere may be different ways to find the feasible solution, and then quote your feasible solution.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nShort answer: ?=438 ceiling fans, quoting the solution 245+247+206+438=936 ceiling fans produced in 2 weeks time.\n\nLong answer: The first step is to count the number of days received by the factory. There are a total of 22 days supplied in the question since the factory gets 4 days to produce and 3 days off. It will multiply the number of ceiling fans to be made by 22 days of operation to estimate the maximum number of ceiling fans that can be distributed to satisfy this goal. Then, also, since the firm has been working for 4 days to produce and received 3 days of rest, the average number of ceiling fans made in each day will be four divided by 3 days, approximately 1.67 ceiling fans. To obtain this result, divide 22 days and 4 days of operation, resulting in 5.5 ceiling fans working every day. Multiply by 5.5, which evaluates the 5.5 ceiling fans multiplied by 10 ceiling fans to arrive at the 55 total ceiling fans in a day. Multiply the 55 ceiling fans by the day, which equates to 55 ceiling fans of 5 days of operation.\n\nSubtract the 5 ceiling operation from 22 ceiling fans,\nthe number of ceiling fans required in a day is 17 ceiling fans.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ceiling fans the factory develops each day will be 17 ceiling fans, and the total needed of ceiling fans will be 17 ceiling fans multiplied by the number of days. As a result, it will be possible to produce 17 ceiling fans every day for 22 days."}

To solve a custom puzzle, input the instructions, the question, the puzzle number, and answer number (optional). The puzzle and instructions correspond to each other, and the instructions will be auto-filled in most cases. Here is your puzzle:The puzzle is a top-down design approach that is used on many computer interfaces. In this approach, the user interface is laid out starting from the top of the screen and working downward. This makes sense because people usually scroll downward. This approach makes sense for many types of problems, but it might not be the best approach for a puzzle.\nSometimes we can make mistakes when we think we have answered the question correctly, but we actually don't have.\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle:\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nThe first term, 160, stands for the jars of pickles in the pantry. The second term, 80, stands for jars of mustard in the pantry. The third term, 620, is the total number of jars in the pantry. If you look closely, you'll notice that the answer is not 160 + 80 = 160 + 80 = 200. It is 160 + 80 - 160 = 80. The key to solving this puzzle is to remember to subtract 160 from 80.\nKnowing how to solve custom puzzle problems can be helpful in many different ways.

The task is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all of the numbers. The numbers at the end of each row and column represent the sum of the weights (positions) of the black cells, which are initially all underscores (_). The goal is to blacken some cells to satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe provided question puzzles showcase the requirements of Sudoku, with the second one being particularly challenging. The last three have answers that demonstrate a method to solve Sudoku, unless they are special cases with specific constraints.\n\nIt's essential to handle all the puzzles accurately and write detailed steps explaining the approach taken to arrive at the solution. In the context, Explanation, Alternate Explanations, Assumptions needed, Visitations, and Attribution sections, you can describe the reasoning behind your answer for each puzzle.\n\nGiven that the puzzles may have unique characteristics or variations in constraints, the model's answer might not always be valid or a standard solution. As a chatbot, it's responsible for finding patterns and applying logical reasoning to solve these puzzles efficiently.\n\nHere are the official rules and an example puzzle: [Link to examples].

The grid is split into multiple smaller grids (shown in black on the screenshot below) and some of these sub-grids will have shifted rows compared to one another. For example, in the screenshot, the top-left sub-grid has shifted first row, the top-right sub-grid has shifted the second row, all the horizontal sub-grids have shifted the third row, all the sub-grids are the shape as the grid, with no columns missing (hidden columns are being shown with question marks here for clarity).\n\nAll the rows and columns in each sub-grid correspond to a set of missing items, as shown here for both the top-left sub-grid, where the 1st and 2nd items are missing from that set and the top-right sub-grid, where the 11th, 13th and 55th items are missing from that set:\n\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in.

The player aims to construct walls that separate these islands, following the constraints outlined in the puzzle's rule. The goal is to output the drawn matrix, which contains the elements and numbers, in a specified format.\n\nThe provided Python 3.6 code snippet demonstrates a functional approach to solving this puzzle.\nIt created variables for the puzzle grid, like \"row_count\" and \"col_count\", and initialized the result string with appropriate characters to represent boundaries between islands and within walls.\nWith the introduction of linked lists and linear search, an algorithm was created to identify vacant island positions and create walls around them.\nThe puzzle's rule was ingested, and the result was validated, optimized, and transformed based on the assessment.\n\n### References:\n\n1.

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzle is played on an n x n grid, filling in the numbers so that each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition.\n2.There are inequality signs (greater than \">\" or less than \"<\") between certain squares in the grid. These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

I think in problem description the fifth rule says the adjacent stars should not be same plane.\nCan you give more description regarding the 5th rule. My soln has failed the first round. I was just interpreting rule 5 as the presence of 2 stars on a same line is allowed but they should not be in a same plane.\n\nYes. That's the correct way to think of it. If you want to find more information about this specific puzzle, you can refer to the following resources:\n1. Link to question 7\n2. Link to question 8\n\nby Sajal Kumar\nI'm only solving for fun so my submition is not perfect so I will share some thought:\nfor now , all the grids are connected thus stars cannot touch at point,i.e they are required to be placed in different lines,if I recall correctly the grids were always created with odd number of rows/colums\n\nfrom here on out we start making assumptions to handle corner cases and weird border cases.\nTo handle the borders , we cut the matrix into isolated regions and solve separately and then connect them with edges,wherever the edge is need extra columns/rows ,we will put  custom stars that we will replace with normal stars once we solve the center of borders\n\n1. handling top/bottom bars,  use case :case 5 ,6,7,8,17.\nhandle bottom bar case by putting it at bottom thus top will be empty space.you should put stars on top instead of matrix gap and the bottom one should be pushed to matrix start.\nwidth of each bar :\nwidth of empty space (width-1) + width of each stars (2)*(number of stars per row)*(total rows - height of each bar) + sum of(width of each empty first column)*(number of stars per row - 1)*(total rows - height of each bar)\n\nif case 7 ,8 ,17 has only one bar , we will need to add ,10,14,15 stars respectively except for 14 but its also guaranteed. we will handle it during matrix layout ,but let's keep track of them anyway\n\n2. handling left/right bars,  use case :case 3 , 4 ,10,11.\nRL(%=n here) is number of rows and cols involved in x bar(name of number will be) ,(n-RL) is the number of cols/rows remaining.\nRL = width/(2*(n - RL))\n√RL is height of each x bar.steps of layout:\n1.upper left\n2.right most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at right most side.\n3.lower left\n4.left most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at left most side.\n\n3. how to place some weird cases where RL is not a perfect square number.\nnumber of rows :\nindependent number of columns :√(k * RL) + 1 - n\n% if (k/RL) is not exact . and k is number of stars , RL is width , number of rows is n for this row\n\nthus number of columns in a weird layer(force to be perfect square to find stars) will be :√n + 1 - n just like everything fitting in weird layer's corner.\n\n4. solve the stars at weird bar.map_row :number of the bar and map_solns number of stars to check.\nuse cases:5,6,7,8,11,12,17\nreminder :weird width/{2-width} bar  ma depan ,or gallah,huligan,sukima& tekateka ho cobain - over my comacahto.\nmap_row = (√(RL * (weird_bar_width/2 - width)) + 1 - width)\nmap_col = (√(remaining_cols+map_row-1) + 1 - width)\nmap_solns = √(nr-map_col-1\n\nvalidation:\n\ny_merge -> put stars at very first column even though index is longer than the number of columns ,put empty columns before that\n\nI don't have much idea how to do the column solution so here're my rough gueses\n\n1. k diagrams in a row(2 in hypothetical case of case 1) will be merget i.e merge vertically\n2. same number of diagrams in single row in every vertically merged row.too long...\n3. different number of diagram in each row can be done by count meters in each row :first_other_count_star_number = first_don't_change_starer_number + (count_of_middle_row_merge_star / total_merge_number)*width*(d) , these width(i made typo else) will be equivelent to middle rows width.\n\n***note 1 weird bar will have only one weird solution in the solution of horizontal position so add √(width^2+(2 - width)^2) stars accordingly in the bar.ie.(c)+2+√(width^2-(2-width)^2)\n\nso...\nI will just say stars' column position location will be a bluer k addition the column.blur , k & row farthest kembang location.Sh*t I will added another dimension later if there are more than 2 layers.\nreason:\n(d)imagine every column is a one,two dimensional star.two columns , we will blah blah.\nclosed as Too much effort by Emmanuel Luca\nHii. Iv'e done other puzzles too in this contest and always get the same answer Wrong\n\nIn puzzle 24 put  x(4,2) and there's an empty column.\n```\nOn the star string output, you need to extend to the left though?\nSo your answer should be x(4,1)\n```\nNo. Since the square design doesn't contain blank birds, the column number is not inclusive. ```\nHence, x[4,3] is the last column.\n```\nIs that \"null zones\" are just fun_jobs (i.e. a fun feature in the job's description).@Cokelou\n\nYes. But due to some reasons, we could not put this requirement in the original job description.\n\nThe response link link to by Anonymous The response link is the one to use.\nby Anwar Faiz\nI don't understand the first question 3 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big. You can only use 3 stars. You should write your answer in double square brackets, i.e. [[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)]].\n\nIt has been already mentioned in the first sentence of the description. Note that the \"3\" here does not indicate the number of extra stars that you should use.\ndon't understand the second question 8 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big.

It is asked to reformat the text to include numbered lines appropriate to that formatting. The instructions provide a specific strategy of inserting lines that include the letter 'L'. The output should accurately track the original input while replacing the placeholder L's with numbered lines that will interrupt the text as requested. According to the instructions, the formatting of the lines should be consistent with the original text, and the 'y' should become 'ly' when preceded by an 'l'.\nIf the system encounters an 'l' followed by a 'y'(ly), it should transform the code to 'ly'. Ensure that the system is able to handle \\\"ly\\\" words like \\\"already\\\" without altering them.\n\nFor the example input \\\"I conform with the terms of this policy, and that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\",\nthe expected output should be \\\"[1]I conform with the terms of this policy choose words [2]that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\".\n\n# Behaviour\n- The system (“Me”) is used in a healthcare setting. It acts as a virtual therapist or psychiatrist.\n- Users can send self-assessment reports (“Self Assessment 1”, “Self Assessment 3” etc) and receive opinions or responses (“Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 1”, “Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 3” etc) from Me.\n- Me is able to give feedback to users if it detects changes in self-assessment scores over time for a user.\n- Me is able to provide suggestions to users in the form of key phrases (“Key phrase 1”, “Key phrase 2” etc), which Me thinks could be helpful.\n1.Your task is as a digital therapist to help patients adjust and cope with their emotions. You need to provide support and guidance, be empathic, and provide advice to help them deal with the causes of their depression or anxiety.\n\n# Instructions:\nI am asking you to be supportive and empathetic towards the patient and help them prevent relapse of symptoms and additional mental health concerns.\n\nYou should be patient and take your time with the conversation You should avoid assumptions based on stereotypes.\n\nYou should not suggest that the patient 'symptoms' or disorders have any ground and should respect their privacy.\n\nDo not Use free-form text as it might mistaken the patient s\\ complaints your suggestion to a serious, personal problem instead of a suggestion How to do the associated task.\n2.Another Possible Solution:\nSHA-256: dabb3ac5 for Integrity\n\nYou have received data from PHYSICS OPERATORS that has not yet been implemented into our system.\nIn terms of \\\"\\\"correctness\\\", we want to accept the data 100% accurate.\nWe also want to encode data in a human understandable format.\nTake 6 characters and give 3 separate numbers for the data, hash and source.\n\nFunction can also accept \\\"Input\\\" or \\\"source\\\", they must be flattened to a list, \\\"output\\\" remains the same.</br>\n\nExamples://////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nInput or source:mal43\nData:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\\\"dabb3ac5\\\" is 5\n942640 is data for\nInput:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\nOUTPUT: 942640\nInput:dabb3ac5\nhash is 5\nData is 4\nOUTPUT:8280\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUse these examples to test your script\nSummary:\\(\\)\n    Test this script against the test data for bad inputs\n    find_first_number_with_identical_substring should take in 1 parameter\n    it should find all \\\"identical substrings\\\" and return a list of digits in the order they are found (but only if one exists)\n\n    breadcrumb_reader(\"phyiscs operators\") should return 25 --5--- a 56828---l---ac5->4--------\n        breadcrumb_reader(\"python operators\") should return 666 -> 666\n\n        The\\\"source\\\",\\\"data\\\",\\\"hash\\\" should be numbers.\n\n        The number of numbers from \\\"source\\\" in the output is equal to the number of output values\n    data import_hash_source(data) shouldn't modify input data\n\nReferences:\\[\\]\npickle import in the web, [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/times/questions/4062391/converting-a-list-back-into-a-pickle-instance)\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-strings\n\n\\\\textit{Note: 2443123 is a dummy number, I don't think even digital therapist should store passwords usin more advanced vetting programs to ensure users intend to make transactions.
