Simplify the equations:**\n\n* 9(7x + 2y) = 180  =>  63x + 18y = 180\n* 5(2x + 3y) = 65   =>  10x + 15y = 65\n\n**3. Solve the system of equations:**\n\nOne way to solve is using elimination:\n\n* Multiply the second equation by -6.3:  -63x - 94.5y = -414.5\n* Add this modified equation to the first equation: -76.5y = -234.5\n* Solve for y: y = 3.066...\n\nSince we need integer values for x and y, we made a mistake somewhere.
