Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the ciphertext.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,"}

In his 1904 speech, he stated \"those crafty people in Spain are opposed to us, not Germans.\" The speech was turned into an opera in 1909. In 1910 he made the first recorded journey to Antarctica, to see Antarctic glaciers. On 29 April 1912, during a month and a half war with Germany, he claimed to have been forced to fly under false colors, shortly after arriving back in the United States from his month and a half stay in Tangier, where he took its flags from a German submarine. After being taken to the fleet's headquarters in Italy, he then sailed to Tangier, another British-controlled naval base. The mission was initially successful, but the Germans soon took an active part in the attack, sending in airships to attack him, supposedly taking him and his ship back to Germany. Contrary to his orders, aviators began bombarding the Russian airfield in Seville (which was subsequently destroyed by the Allies) with a new experimental 75mm bomb called the \"Muniz bomb\". This bomb contained 400kg of a highly toxic poison, and had a 70% death rate among the entire population of the town. The bomb proved very effective in destroying the Russian airfields and was dropped over the capital buildings of Seville. Some of those attacked had already been killed or had gone underground; those who survived were killed, and as a psychological effect, the civilian population was devastated. In the Battle of Safra Mahmoud Hamoud, the commanding officer assigned Manning as his principal assistant. While commanding the air arm of the rebel army, Manning had a number of air strikes on Russian cities, as well as an Italian front. During the summer tour, he flew a Suchie artillery piece over the bridge at Anzio, using it as a self-propelled transport.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of seventeen, Manning joined the Massachusetts Military Academy, a private officer's club that was regarded as one of America's most prestigious military academies. It was run by George Washington, who later became the commander of the U.S. Army. He did not enjoy school, and spent many days and nights staying away from home, studying military books. In 1925, he decided to leave the school and join the U.S. Army Air Corps as a pilot. He later received the bulk of military training as a navigator, but rather than immediately board a ship he went into a small squadron at home. In time, he learned the intricacies of flight procedures, such as avoiding aircraft by being a one-year apprentice in a foreign military position.\n\nWhile serving in America too, he became a member of The American Legion, the first African American military group to hold formal training in the use of aircraft. In his first year of training he had been granted permission to use the Spitfire XK7567 as his personal fighter plane. While still in his first year, he took part in a fly-by-night mission in the Bermuda triangle. Manning was a Chief Wingman with the USS Spitfire, when his plane was shot down in the Bermuda Triangle. Another American had also been killed, and was reported to have sustained minor injuries and the cockpit had fallen into the water. He managed to swim to the beach but was unable to move due to his injuries and had to be lifted from the aircraft in a sling, which was attached to a rescue boat. His plane was also shot down, but he survived; he was rescued and assumed to be still alive.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Manning decided to stay on with the AAF as a pilot, and began working as a civilian flight instructor. He later applied to join the British Air Force as a pilot. He married Peggy Flaherty, the daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten (Mountbatten's private secretary). They had three children.\n\nIs this the start of what would become PTI's latest new company (after its first step to oblivion)? Not quite, but you want to know what it really means for you as an individual. The answer, Manning goes, is a lot. They no longer ask: If we keep up the same way we're doing now (or perhaps start new), will we be able to get our customers to use PTI?\n\nI'm not sure about \"too much water being kept up.\" As Dave discovered on a hot summer day, water makes you feel hot. So if your company is trying to start new, you're really overdoing it, and you may not have known.\n\nWe'd love to talk the topic of water with you. Perhaps we can get our customers not to store water; instead, make it available to their friends so they can use it in the real world too. This would be a better idea for the following reasons:\nGiven that, we've got two main goals.\nThe first one is quite simple. Let's say we give everyone a few minutes to drink or mix up their water, and ask them to fill in two containers"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

So, you decide to change the fixed key.\n\nMischievous asks you to perform these tasks:\n1. Find the number of fixed keys you changed, noting that you can repeat the same key multiple times.\n2. Provide the unique combinations among the 50 fixed keys (in the usual notation of combinations).\n\n### Answer:\n1. As each character is encrypted independently, it's easy to calculate for each character. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is 2^8, so for each character, the number of fixed keys is 2^8. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is 2^8 x 2^8 x ... x 2^8 = 2^(8\\*50).\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from 2^8, the number of combinations is: C(2^8, 2) + C(2^8, 3) + ... + C(2^8, 50), which is a combination.\n\n### Question:\nCan you provide the above answer in LaTeX notation?\n\n### Answer:\n1. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is $2^8$, so the number of all encrypted results for each character is also $2^8$. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is $(2^8)^{50} = 2^{8 \\times 50}$.\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from $2^8$, the number of combinations is: $\\sum_{k=2}^{50} C(2^8, k)$.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\nSince the new rule is unknown, it's impossible to provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nOkay, the new rule is as follows:\n\n- Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n- Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2 ,6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 5)\n\nAccording to this new rule, please provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Different from the conventional computable functions, pseudo-computable functions only need to satisfy the following four conditions.\n\n(1) It will definitely terminate.\n(2) It is allowed that the time cannot be reduced in polynomial time.\n(3) Space complexity is permitted in polynomial order.\n(4) The accuracy of the computation is relaxed by 99.99%, because the accuracy can be divided into ten levels: 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.99999%, 99.999999%, 99.9999999% and 99.99999999%, it just requires the first level of accuracy to be enough.\n\nThen, a pseudorandom algorithm that requires only pseudo-computability, and is an uncomputable function.\n\nExplanation of this algorithm, I have provided a SAT solver based on depth-first search and complete exploration, which can solve all the SAT problems that can be drawn. Let me define the following notations for all the problems that can be expressed by SAT:\n\n$$ SAT(x) = \\begin{cases} {\\text True} & {\\text when\\space x\\space can \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ {\\text False} & {\\text when\\space x\\space cannot \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\nAnd now, I will use the set of all SAT problems that can be drawn and the set of ${\\text true}$ as examples. Although it can be proved that you cannot use Depth-first search and complete exploration strategy to solve even the simplest three-variable problem, it is definitely solvable as a mathematical problem.\n\nFor example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nUnder the premise that the problem can be solved, if it is written as SAT, it can be definitely solved. No need for a proof, although I provided a set of $n$ for $DFS(Search_{Depth}=n)$ to make it unsolvable. While you can solve the problem mathematically, you will not be able to prove its solution based on a variety of SAT solvers.\n\nFor another example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B \\vee C) \\wedge (A \\vee B \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nCan also be solved by SAT expressed as. While the solution time will not be shorter, this cannot be faster than n-polynomial order to prove because of the use of greedy random sampling in the set of all SAT problems more than one to solve it but not a set of all SAT problems that can be solved.\n\nTherefore, an uncomputable function can be obtained by time complexity $O(n)$ :\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}}{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} SAT(y)} $$\n\nExplanation of its uncomputability: It is $\\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}$ in this formula that is uncomputable, which requires that it must be used as a complex function and that it cannot be reduced in polynomial order. \n\nHowever, it can be observed that its uncomputability is only due to a numerical perspective, and it satisfies neither the halting problem nor the necessary but not sufficient stopping condition of first-order logic.\n\nIn addition, it follows that the uncomputable function can be pseudo-computable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: So any function expressed in first-order logic is computable?\n\nAnswer: No, I gave an algorithm that is indeed computable but an uncomputable function through Ennumeration. If there are all enumerations of a function, then this function must be computable. So the set of all functions is uncountable and the set of all X is infinite, so is all functions.\n\n-----\n\n\nExplanation of why the set of universal computing machine code is not infinite. \n\nQuestion: Please prove it.\n\nAnswer: I will first re-describe the requirements related to universal computing machine code.\n1. Binary encoding must be allowed.\n2. The code type of the universal computing machine can be represented by one less than the bit sequence that represents all problems that can be solved after encoding.\n3. Its state complexity is much larger than the upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity, for example, the data compression program for the Kolmogorov complexity.\n4. Computable Number Standard (which is completely represented by 0, 1, and 2) is acceptable to prove and tends to a and b.\n5. The function allowed to be represented is not of polynomial type.\n6. Multi-computing, multi-algorithm and multi-state transitions are allowed to simulate through simple normalization, and since we cannot use the Turing completeness standard of the Turing machine due to the problem related to the uncomputability. \n\nTherefore, its code space size is exponential in binary, about 6000 bit, very small, in fact, it is at most a little more than $2^{16374}$ if we take a try upper bound, as for how many, let's do a mathematical analysis. There are at least a thousand computing machine languages in the world, this is the number of computing machine language core classes, well, because it includes a variety of different programming languages and assembly languages, etc., the core classes are 1000, and there are that many. \n\nAfter all, a variety of operator symbol compilation language classification, I will use the conventional traditional virtual machine as an example of certification. If you take the number of the general virtual machine bit in about 1000 core of the virtual machine, one example will give, such as the VM code is now a core of a total of 8000 bit. \n\n$UCode(N,M) = \\sum_{x=1}^{VM(N,M)} (VM\\space CODE\\space upper\\space bound : 8000) * (Algh: \\frac{1}{2^{16367} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{...}}}}} * \"\\space time\\space consumption: \\frac{M}{2^{length(M) / 2}}<2^{M-length(M)} \\space \\frac{M}{terms(M)}<2^{M-terms(M)}\"))_{Upper} $\n\nWhen defining a universal computing machine, we cannot ignore both the problem domain's upper and lower bounds and the method complexity including the approximation method based on a variety of approximate methods. In the end, defining the problem as unsolvable would be very foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable set in mathematics\n\nThere is a mathematical set above, where the first set contains at least one computable number at $Ox,Oy,...,X_n,Y_n,...,M_n$ (doubles are counted just once). And among them, there is (as a maximum limit) one non-computable $logn$ and one at least non-computable $x,y$ that can be computed as a pseudo-computable.\n\n*For example* : New double-precision floating-point format\n\nTwo-tuple: one-bit sign bit, nine-bit exponent field excluding the highest bit, and eighteen-bit fraction field $(N_m,F_n)$\n\nA particular floating-point format in which eighteen bits of the fraction field are used to represent the first two bits of the $\\beta_n$ in the following figure.\n\n$(N_m,F_n)\\space \\beta_n = \\space (N_m,1+\\frac{F_n}{2^{18}}) $\n\nSet : $(N_0, F_0), ("}
