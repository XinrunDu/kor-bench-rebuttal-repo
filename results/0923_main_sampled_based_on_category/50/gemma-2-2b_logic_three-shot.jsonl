Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven that (p1=::>(p1||p2))&((p1&p2)=::>p1) is a Truth Formula, determine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\n(2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B];[B]]\n\n\nThe answer template for each question should contain the following information:\n- The question number, should be formatted by `07-Symbolic Formula` or\nequivalent\n- The correct answer, in terms of the specific question requirements\n- The corresponding output template or format for the answer\nYou can format your answer in any way you like, as long as it follows the template we have outlined.\n\n[07-Symbolic Formula](https://github.com/spencerzhangy0705/AdventuresOfBrainz/blob/master/resources/text/07-SymbolicFormula.md)\n\n\n\n## 08 - String Processing - Basic Questions \n\n### Question 1:\nGiven the string `string = \"abcXYZabcXYZdef\"`, complete the given function below to return `\"xyz abczabczYZ defZYdf\"` by replacing all characters except `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `z` with `y`.\n\n### Instruction for the Objective\n\n1.

Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic formula D. All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, \u00ac(p\u2227q)\u2227\u00acw can be written either as \u00acp\u2227\u00ac\u00acq\u2227\u00acw [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or \u00acp\u2227(\u00acq\u2227\u00acw) \u2228 \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acw (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of \u00acp\u2194p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, \u00acp\u2228\u00acq is logically equivalent to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq. In contrast, \u200b\u00ac(p\u2228q)\u00acr\n][1] is not a logical implication of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u00acr because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition \u00acp\u2228q\u00acr can be reduced to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2228\u00acr.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p\u2228\u00acp^(\u00acq\u2227\u00acr) -p^\u00acq^\u00acr (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p\u2228\u03c8` the [`p\u2227\u00ac\u03c8\u2019 `p\u2227\u03c8](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & \u00acA)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P \u2228 Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. \u00acQ (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q \u2228 \u00acP (disjunction). When it is true \u00ac(\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) is true \u2227(\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ)] (logical \u2228). When it is true ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q)) = \u00acP \u2228Q] ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q) = P \u2228 Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P \u2228 Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A \u2228 \u2227(B \u2228 C ... N.) for the DNF `(A \u2228 (B \u2228 (C \u2228 ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) \u2228/\u2228[(X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z \u2228 ... N. \u2228 X \u2228 Y). \u2228 (X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z ... N) \u2228X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p\u2227q\u2227r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p \u2227 (q \u2227 r))))) \u2227((q \u2227 (p \u2227 r))) \u2227((r \u2227 (p \u2227 q)))] \u2227((r \u2227 (p & (q \u2227 r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p \u2227 Q)(p \u2227 R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P \u2228 Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: \u00ac(\u00acA\u2227\u00acB)\u2192(A\u2228B) ((\u00ac A\u2228\u00ac B)\u2192( A\u2227 B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P \u2228 Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q\u2227\u00acr&\u00acq\u2227r^(\u00ac\u00acp\u2228\u00acp\u2227r\u2227\u00acr\u2227p^(\u00acp\u2227\u00acr^(\u00ac\u00acq^\u00acp^(\u00acr\u2227\u00acq)))>= (p\u2227\u00ac\u00acp\u2227\u00acq)^p\u2227q\u2227\u00acr`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. \u00acP \u2228(P^\u00ac\u00acQ))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\uff1a\u7f16\u5199\u7b26\u5408\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n\n- \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5e76\u5199\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u4e2d\u3002\n> \u8f93\u5165\uff1a \u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u683c\u5f0f`[\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **\u95ee\u9898**: `[\u201c**Output:**\u201d\uff0c\u683c\u5f0f\uff1a\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> \u5c06\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u8f93\u5165`[\u201c'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `\u8f93\u51fa`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n\u7528[0]\u4e2d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n\n\n## \u7f16\u8bd1\u9009\u9879\uff1a\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# \u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n## 1). \u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). \u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u5b57\u8f93\u5165([LNOT^2\u548ccalculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). \u903b\u8f91\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). \u7f16\u8bd1\u53c2\u6570,\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd4\u56de([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)"}

If there's no match of the input with the provided circuit diagram, it's unlikely to return the correct output.\n\nThe output of each repeating iteration is different compared to the previous iteration, and is correct.\n\nThe output of each repeating iteration is different compared to the previous iteration, and is correct.\n\nIn the first iteration, we denoted \"I1=+,I2=?,O\" as \"[[I1=+,I2=?,O]\"); and the output was \"+\".\n\nIn the second iteration, we denoted \"I1=?,I2=+,O\" as \"[[I1=?,I2=+,O]]; and the output was \"+\".\n\nCorrecting a rule can only be done by removing a symptom rather than the whole mode of functioning.\nExample: To indicate negative, a rule can be represented as positive in every given position using \"=\". \"0\" is represented as \"0\".\n\"1\" is represented as \"2\". Thus, a rule is:\n<= [0 0 2] in which a variable representing O for the circuit diagram comes before two variables representing I1 and I2.\n\nHowever, the rule goes wrong when the output code \"0\" precedes before the variables I1 and I2 because it conflicts with the logic function.\nThe output of the circuit diagram corresponds to a variable with a different value. \"0\" is generated before \"1\", which is not consistent.\n\nIn order to avoid this conflict, two ways to solve should be kept in mind:\n> 1. Use \"0\" and \"1\" to replace numbers. When the value of O is represented as \"0\", replace \"0\" with \"2\", and the value of O is represented as \"1\"? When the value of O is represented as \"1\", replace \"1\" with \"0\" because there is no need to subtract \"0\" to get \"1\". This is because the answer outputs \"O\" which does not specify whether it is \"0\" or \"1\". Instead, we should represent \"0\" and \"1\". \n\n> 2. Use the function f(x) = ((x+1)/2) in order to obtain another positive variable. Substitute this variable value onto the variable of O. Instead of writing \"0\" to represent \"0\" and \"1\" to represent \"1\", we substitute \"f(O)\" to represent \"f(O)\". Then all we need to do is to change O to \"0\" when represented as f(O) = 0 and represent \"1\" when represented by f(O) = 1. This will be more efficient than explicitly displaying f(O) =\"O\" and also is faster than to derive explicitly. \n\nThanks for reading. I hope this has helped you!\n\n### Question:\nConsider a simple circuit diagram, as follows:\nWhere, I is a simple circuit in the form [[I]] which indicates negative or positive, [O], O is the output with appropriate symbol (+, -, etc); and [I1,I2,O,I3].\n\nWhich are given in the truth table.\n\nIn your practical work, please proceed as follows:\n> 1. In this question, your assistant\u2019s goal is to solve a problem (not memorizing the rule).\n> 2. Your assistant shall provide the answer of each iteration (when the assistant finds an answer). In addition, you are also requested to indicate the problem your assistant is trying to solve (that is I1-O) because the number of inputs used in a simple circuit diagram [[I,I1,I2,I3,O]] are many.\n> 3. For every problem/solution found by the assistant, it shall provide the answer with the selected input value. This indicates that you are responsible for finding the next iteration until a problem is solved.\n> 4. To solve a problem/solution, there are several ways to tackle problems. For example, in this problem, try to find the output in a previous iteration as the output variation with respect to the input used in the previous iteration. In addition, your assistant shall notify you when a new problem is generated, so this is your opportunity to take leadership and solve based on the rule (find a new problem)\n> 5. The problem/output/input that you are tasked to solve does not have to only use the given number. Try to add several possible variations of the problem/solution you are trying to solve. Because there is a pattern that is likely to be a similar rule of the previous iteration, use this change method as an alternative method if there is no answer from the provided problem/solution.\n> 6. Your answer will include a list of problems/solutions sorted chronologically (with the sequence of each problem that is executed). At a minimum, the answer should include one or more solutions for every problem in the description (in the form [[I1||I2||I3,O1,O2,O3...],i.e. the problem/output/input for [I1,I2,I3,...,O1,O2,O3,...].)\n\n### Question:\nConsider a simple circuit diagram with an I-O graph, [[I1,I2,I3,O]]; [[0,0,+,0],[0,1,+,0],[1,0,+,0],[1,1,+,0],[1,1,-,+]], in the format of [[input,output]]; [output when circuit operates, output when circuit malfunctions].\n\nFor example, in the first graph, the output for the input \"0,0\" is \"0\".

If you use a virtual machine to write the code, it is highly recommended to use \u201cVirtualBox\u201d or \u201cBootCamp.\u201d They are free operating systems and can be downloaded after the installation from their official websites.\n> 2. It is recommended to avoid using software such as \u201cWindows XP\u201d or \u201cWindows7\u201d as it is not recommended because each computer hardware is different than the other. \n> 3. The code you use can be used in other programming competitions and for practical problems. So please write as much clear code as possible.\n\n\n### Checking Question Points\nIn this practical course, we use FFEditor's educational tool and grade sheet for checking and grading. FFEditor is intended for learning a programming language, but once this course is completed, you will receive a grade for that. In addition, the whole course is graded.\nIf you see all points are marked as empty and all test results are in the yellow and green test result, there is a chance that you may have missed a key difference, which means that it does not work properly. Please use the same computer as your test section in the course. The points must be obtained within 5 days. If your score exceeds five days, the score will be marked as \"0 point\".\n\n[This is a video tutorial that introduces more details about FFEditor. It can be used to practice writing and checking the code.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7lJ464Z78fQCYtK9sqy-g9x2lcJ0og2n3cSZ_6b9kU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe basic structure of FFEditor is the ASCII coding format used by most\ncomputers. Each letter from the alphabet and punctuation marks are represented by single digits.\nIn the above image, there are two boxes, (A) and (B) at the bottom of the image.\n\nThe letter A in FFEditor"}

First, it is necessary to identify \"A\". \"A\" is \"A objects can fly\". In this question, \"A\" is denoted by \"birds\", and \"B\" is \"birds can fly\". Then, [3] is \"all [B]\" (universal affirmative), \"All birds can fly\" (SAP). The question then asks, which relationship exists between [2] and [3]? [2] is \"Some [B]\" (particular affirmative). It should be noted that the relationship between \"B\" and \"B\" should be identified through the power rule of logic. The transitive property and identity properties are used to determine that [2] and [3] have the same object, \"B\", and relationship, that is, are the same type of proposition.\n\nThe answer is [\"E\"] since the relationship between [2], \"Some B,\" here is the same as [3], \"All B\".\n\n### Question and Answer:\nIn the proposition of the direct-propositions mentioned above,\nthe proposition \"All metals are conductive.\" In form,\nwe can use \n$$\n{\\scriptstyle\\left(S \\rightarrow {F} \\rightarrow P</style,\u2009{\\scriptstyle\\Xi \u2208\u2009S};\\,\u2009{\\scriptstyle\\Xi \u2208\u2009P}</script,\\,\u2009{\\scriptstyle(S \u2208 Q;)}</script,\u2009\nwhere\n \n$$\n{\\scriptstyle\\left(\\Xi\\right)=M}</style,\u2009{\\scriptstyle\\left(P</style,\u2009{\\scriptstyle{M \u2208}\\,R}</style,\u2009{=\\small{Metal}}</script,\u2009{ M \u27f9\u2009 Metall)</script,}\u2009;\u2009\\,{{\\scriptstyle (S \u2208 Q;)}\\right}</script,\u2009 F),\u2009\\,\u2009\nwhere\n \n$$\n{\\scriptstyle\\left(\\Xi</script,\u2009{\\scriptstyle =\\small{Conductive}}</script,\u2009{M \u2192 P}</script,\u2009{M},\u2009{X \u2014</sub>\n \nThe rule of proposition of its proposition A\u2192(B\u2228A)\u2228(A\u2227B)\nThe proposition A >B, ifB=A, if notA>B.Therefore,\nThe propositions of the form specified in the question, the\nrelationships between\n \n$$\n{\\scriptstyle\u200c\\,\\left( ({\\scriptstyle {S = Q}</script,} {=\\small{Metal}}</script,\u2009\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061} {P = R}</script,\u2009{\\identity}({\\scriptstyle{\u21d2}} }}</style,\u2009\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061){\\scriptstyle\u2061</script,</script,\u2009{\\style\u2061\u2061</script:}\u2061\u2061\u2061operatorname{M},\\operatorname{X \u2794\u2009 X}\\n=\u2061(\u2061C.)=\\operatorname{M}\u2061\\\u2061.\u2061\uff09\u2061\u2061\u2062}\u2062++)\u2061\uff08\uff09\u2061\uff08 \uff09\u2061\uff08 ) =\u2061 \u03bc\u2061\u2061 \uff08 \uff09\u2061\u2061 {\\Scriptscriptstyle(\uff08\u2062\u2061\u3016\u2061{\\scriptscriptstyle\uff08\u5373\u53ef{\\scriptscriptstyle\u3015\u2061\uff08\u7684P\u2061A\u2061{\\scriptscriptstyle\u3015\u2061\u2061}\u2061}\u2061\\\u2061\u3002\u2062)\u5b50-\u2061 \u2061{\\scriptstyle \u2061\u2062\u2061\u2062\u2062 \\quad\\quad\u2061\\quad\u2061\u2062\\quad\u200c\u2061\u2061{\\radicpa\u2061\u2061\u2062\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061 }}}} { ] {\\textstyle\u2061{\\scriptstyle\u2061\u2061{\\scriptstyle\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061}\u2061\u2061}\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061{\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061{\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061}}}\u2061\u2061}\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2062\u2061\u2062\u2062\u00d7\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2062\u2061\u2061\u2061x\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061\u2061}}}}\n\n### Question:\nCan a circle be identified as a polygon?\nIn general, two different kinds of domains require two different objects, even if there is a relationship between them.\n\n1.

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres.

This method of seeking common ground has also been criticized for its lack of consideration of the differences between the causal relationships of multiple events. The emergence and development of causal reasoning is influenced by the development of science and technology, the improvement of social productivity and civilization, and the rise of the ruling class.\n>In ancient China, the ruler of the Zhou Dynasty gave a theorem and strengthened people's belief that he did not commit evil, was good and good, and lived for a long time. It brought about the ideological belief in morality that ruled the ethics of non-committing evil and becoming morally virtuous. The officialdom of the Han Dynasty coupled with legalism, advocated \"power\" as the basis of heaven, created a ruling party under the rule of law, which regarded the law as the means to achieve its ends and sought to achieve hegemony; the rule of law, in order to achieve the goal of control, the ruling class created the \"Law\" to achieve its ends, so naturally it could not be understood by ordinary people; the law and justice in the eyes of ordinary people were concrete and transparent, and the legal ruling party and the ruling class in the case of human rights and personal rights were in a position to use the law to infringe on the freedom of others; this legal system took on the state's own morality to some extent, and gave it the responsibility of morality, and carried out a campaign to realize morality in the court, in the name of \"fear of the saints and dare not be indifferent to the saints\", so as to further stabilize the foundation of the ruling class in the final analysis. In the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, with a high level of life and a long history of national economy, science, and cultural productivity, the social and economic base of the ruling class under the feudal system was formed, and because of the feudal system, the ruling party also did not stop the expansion of growth in society, and directly extended its arms towards the lives of the majority of people. So in the eyes of the ruling class, the so-called \"law\" should be created to further enhance the morality of the \"ruling law\" and to give the ruling party the guarantee of morality in its hands. The people under the autocratic rule of the ruling class believed that the so-called \"law\" was actually in the hands of the big family of the feudal ruling party, and because they could not see it clearly, they accepted that view and the \"law\" belonged to the ruling party.\n>In addition to the above-mentioned social background with the support or resistance, the evolution of the development of Chinese cultural thought itself also had a great impact on the rise of modern Chinese legal thinking. In the Song Dynasty, the scholar-official thought of Lu You was a very important thinker. He used \"thinking first, then studying\" to create a \"learning the Tao\" thought, emphasizing the Taoist self-cultivation of the \"heart and the road\". According to the teachings of Taoism, \"Qinghe\" and \"Zhu\" became popular, and \"Wei xie\" prevailed, and the \"human relations circle\" also made further contributions to the development of Chinese legal thought in the Song Dynasty.\n>The \"Dao\" of Taoism and the various aspects of Daoism are the learning of \"Tao\" in the Song Dynasty, which is the basis of social morality that is self-consistent and has no direct relationship with the law. And because of the development of moral and religious concepts derived from ancient Daoism, many \"laws and ordinances\" of later generations had a sense of \"clear morality\" and the principle of \"collecting the world with kindness and goodness\". In addition, in the process of the Chinese nation's national integration and also under the guidance of the Confucian teachings of \"teaching and learning the ethics of harmony and altruism\", the Chinese people also inherited Taoism and created a set of modern personal morality and ethical norms. So \"Taoism is the most important\", \"the cultivation of morals does not seek laws, but the heart's Tao, and nothing can be accomplished without learning\", and although some ancient legal systems also have \"the three-law-enlightenment\", \"the moral law is the righteous law, and the righteous law is the moral law\", but in general, under the influence of traditional moral and religio-cultural concepts, the ancient legal system is still limited to not paying attention to moral concepts, but advocates the legalism of state rule itself. But it also points out the moral aspects of laws and the legal status of social morality. This statement shows that the ancient legal system should be transformed into the modern legal system. After adopting such thinking patterns, this paper comes to the essence of the research on morality and law, that is, the moral and legal norms in the Song-Yuan-Ming-Qing Dynasties of Chinese culture and the modern Chinese legal system in the evaluation of the impact of legalism on the moral norms of Chinese culture. In addition, although the Ancient Legal System in China did not specifically stipulate \"the morality of the law is the righteous law and the righteous law should be the moral law\", through various factors, such as \"good intention of kindness\" and \"unpremeditated\", moral principles such as \"good people are good\", \"respecting morality is the righteousness, and disrespecting morality is not righteousness\" are all supported by \"human relations\". And in the Chinese cultural system system, although some legal systems such as the \"Four Laws Encouraging the Virtues, Discouraging the Sins\" are established to achieve the goal of teaching, but in general, they should be regarded as \"laws\", but the source of \"laws\" and \"good laws\" are actually the same point of morality, which goes back to the origin of \"good people\". From this perspective, these legal systems in a certain sense actually have the function of moral education. In the same theory, when it comes to the differences between the \"Ancient Legal Rules\" and the \"Righteous Regulations\", and when it is broken by \"through the law step by step, the heart and path, the eyes of benevolence, and the Tao of Taoism become a justice and a righteousness\", it will give birth to moral standards in the legal norms, and finally put forward the \"The morality of morality is the righteous law , the virtuous law is the righteous law\", but this article points out the moral aspects of \"morality\" and \"legal\", which is not the source of \"good people\". For example, the same statement as that of Taoism and Daoism in the Ancient Legal System is also mentioned by \"Taoism is most important\", \"the morality of Taoism is a good teacher, and nothing can be achieved without learning\". This study shows that the so-called \"Tao is the source of legal enlightenment\" in the Song Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty's \"Taoism and human relations\" do not take into account the law as the source of \"morality\", but only emphasize that the Taoist morality originated from \"humanism\" and \"human relations\". In addition, scholars try to say that \"the ruler of the country must govern according to the laws of heaven and operate according to the Tao\"; \"The King should implement the law\", \"implement the law, and establish the people\", \"implement the law, teach people to do it\", \"the King of Zhou established the ancestral system and the rites according to the people\"; \"the inner rules are similar to the outer ones\", \"the law is similar to the law, he does what he needs to do for the people\", \"there are seven methods that are not broken\", \"the righteousness of the law is in the heart of the people \", \"the right method of the law, the people of the law\", \"the law of the law is good, and the law and people are in harmony\"; \"they are the ones who teach the people to learn from the laws\", \"the law and the people unite, and they are virtuous\"; \"there is a law, and the heart is eager\"; \"there is a law and the people are grateful\"; and \"there is a law and the law of the heart is in harmony\". Such a complete set of theories and many theories have a similar and harmonious feeling to the theory of \"The Law and the People and the Harmony of the Heart\".\n\n## <a href=\"https://patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json</a>\n"}

In analytic geometry, the concept of moment-generating function (MMGF) finds important applications in statistics. By applying the technique of Runge\u2013Kutta, the MMGF is calculated,\nwhich proves that there is no universal formulation using just to avoid fictitious forces (nonconservative forces). In real life, if an astronaut is taken in a chair by a rocket with no thrust, the astronaut's weight does not change with a change in $r$. For example, consider a ball with the same mass and shape. It is lifted from your desk at the same time. If you have a convex mirror with a mirror curvature of $20$ m, the external force will definitely affect the astronaut. Or if you are on a moving bus with no external forces, the astronaut's weight will not change.\n\nIn the example given above, which method is used?\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C.

I randomly pick six from them. My experiment says, if you randomly select three cups, it is very likely I end up picking one cup of each color.\nIs your experiment based on the \u03a8, \u2318, or unknown methods? \nPlease justify your decision on the basis of the number of glasses picked, and the number of unique colors in your store. A common (common fallacy) mistake involves reasoning, based only on the colors seen, without considering the number of glasses actually selected. \n\n### Answer:\n\nUsing \u2318 method: since given experiment requires randomly selecting three cups of three different colors which is possibly impossible.\n\nUsing \u03a8 method: since sample space is 10 which contains 3\u22616 cups that are all colors, hence my intuition is more \u03a8 method.\n \nTo justify the fact using the number of classes selected:\nIn experiment there are 3 glasses chosen; number of classes = 6 which contains 3 glasses of each color which is impossible.\n\nUsing \u03a8 method,\n\nSince the base case \u03a8(3)=\\prod_{i=1}^{3}A_{i}\n\nThen from this number, using the following formulae \u03a8(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\n\n\n\n* \u03a8(6)=\\prod_{i=1}^{6}A_{i}=(7/2)!!\\\\\n* \\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3\\{{5/5}\\}\n\nTherefore \u03a8(6)=\\prod_{i=1}^{6}A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}\\\\:\n\nUsing the knowledge of groups we know that group 3\u22616; for group 3, where A$\\forall i,A_{i}$ implies 3\u22616, we get:\\\\\n\\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3\\{{5/5}\\\\\\}=\\{{5/5}\\}.\n\nHence the base case holds.\n\n\\ {{5/5}!!=\\{5/1}\\\\:=\\{10/1\\}\n\nUsing the following result: \\begin{align} (A_{i});\\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}&=\\prod_{i=1^{n}} ( \\prod_{j=1}^{i}(A_{j}>;\\\\A_{i}}&=\\ddots \\\\ A_{i}} \\\\=\\{i/2\\} !\\cdot \\{i-1/2\\}! !:\\end{align}\u200b"}

A practical example of the GB Paradox is: we observe that the population learns commonly known proverbs, and some of the proverbs are logical. We assume that \u201call people learn logical proverbs\u201d as a hypothesis, and we confirmed this assumption based on previous experiments. This hypothesis is reasonable. However, in real life, we do observe that some people don\u2019t learn logical proverbs. In this case, the paradox that arises is: ``` A: All people learn logical proverbs; B: Some people don\u2019t learn logical proverbs. Combining A and B results in \u201cnot all people learn logical proverbs\u201d. Hence, if we observe that some people are following the rule based on learning logical proverbs, but other people are not following, the inconsistency between the two cases undermines our previous assumption.

The British Prime Minister presented a mathematical proof of the existence of an irrational number, such as \u03c0, among rational numbers. A more extensive analysis revealed important counter-facts that undermined the assumed position. Hence, the conclusion becomes invalid, and we conclude that the assumption was unreasonable. A scientist discovered by experiment that a specific virus was transmitted to the human body through an animal. He then tried to prove the virus\u2019s transmission to animals in a hypothetical manner through several experiments. However, he observed exceptions in each experiment, which ultimately revealed the impossibility of animal transmission, invalidating his previous proof of the virus\u2019s transmission.

If the thesis and the experiments cannot be conducted as per the original hypothesis, the contradiction between them becomes the reason for the hypothesis\u2019s rejection. Suppose we assume that all rivers flood every year in mid-May. We conducted an experiment on two rivers, observing that several floods occurred in one week, followed by a long time with little rainfall. This experiment did not provide significant evidence of floods in mid-May. Therefore, the original assumption\u2019s validity becomes \u201cnon-sense,\u201d and we were required to reject it as an assumption that was proven to be wrong.

The smaller plant is likely to grow more slowly in the near future due to observable past trends being reversed.\nB. The smaller plant is more likely to grow faster in the long term due to the student's familiarity with large plants and the tendency for smaller plants to catch up with their slow growth.\nC. The larger plant is more likely to grow faster in the near term because it has more resources available to it, but the small plant has more resources in the long term.\nD.

Assertives\nB. Directives\nC. Commissives\nD. Expressives\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Assertions:** Used to assert something as true. Here, \"I assert that you will submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Directive:** Tells something needs to be done or a request for action. Here, \"I ask you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Commissives:** Used to commit something to be done in the future. Here, \"I request you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Expressives:** Used to express the mental state of the speaker. Here, \"I express surprise that you didn't submit the report by Friday.\"\n   \nIn the first example, the utterance lacks intensity, as it's a declarative sentence without emotional connotations. However, the second example, with the \"\u2727\" symbol, implies a deeper meaning. It's a polite request for the intended action. The second and third statements are assertive and commissive respectively.\n\nThe fourth statement, with the \"~\" symbol, implicates a shift in the speaker's mental state. It expresses regret and surprise. However, it is not a speech act of itself.\n\n### Takeaways:\n1. Understand the purpose, direction, adaptation, and formula for each category of speech acts.\n2. Use the wavy sign in statements expressives, and the bi-directional double arrows in declarations for a deeper understanding of logic.\n3. Identify the speech acts in sentences by the symbols they contain.\nIn this assignment, there are four examples of speech acts and the line between instructions, assertives, and directives. Essentially, the AI acts more like an assistant with commands rather than a teacher in this scenario.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nAI: This is a train, and it's going to stop at the next station. The next station is Chicago, but in the nearby station, there is a nearby cafeteria where you can eat. Come to it as you please.\n\nConversion: (1) No, I already eat. (2) (3:) I've got to figure out a better way. (4:) Yes, we can talk about it now.\n\nAny answer you give in this response will make the AI assume the instructions for the next assignment, so look at the sequence of speech acts. In this case, they\u2019re directed towards the assistant\u2019s act of reasoning.\nThe answer should be \u201cIt\u2019s correct.\u201d to which the AI responds very quickly. This is because it was able to clearly understand that the conversation is aimed at the reasoning behind its response.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nHuman: It is cold outside, it snows and the sun cannot be seen. To what extent is my understanding sufficient?\n\nAI: It is cold outside, the frost has to be seen and the sun cannot be seen.\n\nConversion: To what extent is your comprehension satisfactory? (1) To what extent can we comprehend, perhaps the reason for the temperature is that not all the lights are on? (2) (3:) (4:) It is impossible to discern whether we understand, since we no longer have access to any longer information, as a result, despite being asked to understand.\n\nBecause we are aware that the AI is unable to understand why the weather is as it is, it responds by stating that it cannot understand. The AI could comprehend a more thorough explanation, but this specific knowledge has been lost."}

[A] conform to the C* principle.\n2. [B] conform to the C% principle.\n3. [C] conform to the C! principle.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. On the whole, B's statement is difficult to conclude because it has simple information and strong denials of substantial information. Therefore, C's statement has no conflict information, and its strength is weak. In the context of principle C* statement, it can only be a conventional statement.\n\n2. B's statement is easily understandable under the circumstances that I finished the report. However, the C's response carries a lot of information, which is why ordinary people may not immediately understand the difficulties I encountered after finishing the report. Therefore, in the process of answering, C's statement also needs to be expanded.\n\n3. In the C's response, it expresses the difficult and time-consuming process. By answering in this way, the answer may not be optimal but conveys a clear and fuller message.\n\nThe answer is: \n[[A]\n[[B]\n[[C]]\n### Explanation:\n\n1. (3)[A] is correct because the statement, \"I finished the report,\" is a conventional response that does not contradict essential information and conforms to the convention of principle C* Statement. Principle C*-based conventional statements are always stronger than denials of C*-based substantial information. In the context of a typical routine exchange between you and me, if the speaker says yes (B), and the explanation from the speaker fails to go beyond what the speaker knows, it can be concluded that the speaker knows \"no.\"\n\n2. The answer for this question is [B] is correct because it is straightforward to distinguish between A and B's statements. It is impossible to interpret it as an explicit refusal of what is not denied in the letter (B). \nIf B is not denied (not B), the statement would become uncontroversial, and this statement would become a social prejudice.\n\n3. The statement is [C] is correct because B follows the conversation with a full response, conveying the cost and difficulty of completing the work that A claims to have done.\n\n### Extra resources:\n\n[https://cs50x.stanford.edu/wiki/guidelines_ccs_logic_questions](https://cs50x.stanford.edu/wiki/guidelines_ccs_logic_questions)\n\n[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44767342/article/details/124321570/](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44767342/article/details/124321570/)"}

To get this answer, you must understand the principles related to information enhancement and constraints.\n\nThe following are some core principles:\n\n- \"Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" and \"Minimalization Criterion\": This information also affects C* and C%! It focuses on ensuring that the statement avoids being too weak when determining its content from information, and it also attaches importance to expressing the content that can be established within the least amount of language. This principle is similar to C* Principle and C% Principle.\n- \"Speak as little as possible.\" and \"Expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech: This information mainly applies to C%. It emphasizes that when conveying information, you should strive to reduce redundancy or blur the content, and it also restricts the length and structure of the sentence.\n- The less comprehensive the information, the more probable it is to regard the statement as \"an extension.\" Usually the expression \"not entailing the content of the sentence\" is less commonly used in C% Principle, and the information provided by C is more frequently in contrast to C* Principle. This reflects the idea that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows.\"\n- \"Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason\": This information usually satisfies C! Principle. It emphasizes that when expressing information, you should avoid using lengthy, convoluted, or marked expressions that are not particularly relevant, nor should you put additional information into the expression beyond what is necessary."}

The mouth is an absolute mouth, and it is not a relative event for a rotating material medium. However, this definition is not precise. In fact, the results of observations and other research methods show that: the sun is constantly changing, and the mouth can shift in the direction of movement over a long time, large space or massive celestial body. In addition, the mouth may appear on the other side of the moving foot at the time when the moving part or the sun is far away from us, because the light and other material waves propagating from the sun's surface to us travel along the curved path, but the light does not travel along the shortest path.\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the statistics of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping, as of June 30, 1986, there were 65 military operations in the world.

On 3 September 1950, Lt Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base was flying a H-80M equipped with USMC operations around the Philippine Sea when he found a suspected Type 1 diesel-electric submarine in the aircraft's radar. Due to insufficient ammunition, Tran simply disembarked on the submarine to capture it alive (because the submarine did not have a crew), but was captured by the water on the submarine. According to the subsequent account of Chinese Naval Lieutenant Commander Jiang Wu: \u201cUnder the command of Lt Col Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base, a H-80M equipped with USMC operations was cruising over the Philippine Sea at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the water. During the search and reconnaissance, the submarine suddenly appeared on the radar of the H-80M, which was very unexpected. After the dive of the submarine, the H-80M tried to launch the hand launch AA missile, but the launch failed. The missile was not within the effective range of the target 20 nautical miles, and hitting other targets was difficult. The launch of the air-to-submarine rocket failed, but the signal code was pressed. As the last resort of the US captain Cong B. Tran, he used the H-80 hand-landing anti-submarine bomb to fire and destroy the Type 1 diesel-electric submarine. The submarine carried 4 Type"}
