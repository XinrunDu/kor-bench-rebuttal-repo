So, we write the answer as **25** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the second question, 2∞5 is equal to 4+25, which is equal to 29. So, we write the answer as **29** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the third question, if X∞4=32, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=32, which simplifies to X^2+16=32. Rearranging gives **X^2=16**, which has two solutions, x=4 and x=-4. However, since the question asks for the number that must be used for the calculation and not for the values of X, we can only use X=4. So, our answer is just `4`.\n\nFor the fourth question, if 3∞X=18, we can rewrite the expression as 3^2+X^2=18, which simplifies to X^2=15. Rearranging gives **X=sqrt(15)**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the fifth question, if X∞4=256, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=256, which simplifies to X^2+16=256. Rearranging gives **X^2=240**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the sixth question, if 2∞X=104, we can rewrite the expression as 2^2+X^2=104, which simplifies to X^2=100. Rearranging gives **X=10**. Or **10**(sqrt(10)). Again, these are both solutions to the expression, but be careful which one you choose for the operation since the result of the assessment depends on it. Here, the precise number is required when the operation is done.\n\nNext step: `3∞X=4´```\n\n#1 :\n\nThis is the answer for third and sixth questions : `4, 6, 10`(or `10, 6`) are the valid solutions of X∞4 = 32. The others will give *Unsupported error: Invalid square root* for X2 = 32, which would lead to a wrong result for your final result ( e.g. 3∞4 = 5 ) because of Sqrt function call.\n\nThe X2 = 32 is achieved by setting the **X** value to 4 ( answer for (b)) or 8 ( answer for third question ).\n"}

Where am I going wrong?\n\nIn total we have 26 labels (0,1,...,25). They are representing the set of letters in all other characters in the string. The way to think about this question is that each letter is divided into 3 sets: Set A (1st Letter), Set B (2nd Letter) and Set C (3rd Letter). These letters cannot be from the same letter. The elements of A can be from B but not B from C. The elements of B can be from both A and C but not A from C. The elements of C can be from both A and B but not A from B. The letter T has no important thing so can be anything, even Set A, Set B or Set C.\n\n<code>def func(str)\n  A, B, C = [], [], []\n  (0...25).each do |letter|\n    (0...str.length).each do |i|\n      if str[i] == (\"a\"*(letter % 3).chars.sample)\n        A << letter\n      else if str[i] == (\"b\"*(letter % 3 + 1).chars.sample)\n        B << letter\n      else if str[i] == (\"c\"*(letter % 3 - 1).chars.sample)\n  C << letter\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  res = []\n  1...@str.length - 1.to_i.step(3).to_a.each do |i|\n    if A[i] >= C[i+1]\n      res << \"T\"\n    end\n  end\n  str = str[0...str.length - 1 + 1.to_i.step(3).to_a.reverse]\n  \"T\" + res << A[0...str.length] + B[0...str.length]\nend\nstr = \"accbb\"\n`func str` #bT\n</code>\n\nLink to console.\n\nI'm really confused on how to even think about solving this question. I also have to write an assert method to do some testing?\n\n<code>class Solution\ndef smallest_factor(n)\n  return n if n==1\n  for i in 1....100001 do\n    if n%i==0 then return i else --end\n  end\nend\n\nassert smallest_factor(62) == 2\n</code>\n\nYou're given an array A of size N. Complete the function to print the minimum element in the given array.\n\n<code>const minimum = function(array) {\n  if (!array || array.length == 0) \n    throw new Error(\"array cannot be zero or empty\");\n  else {\n  var minimum = array[0]; //could be your min\n  array.forEach (function (elem, index, array) {      \n  if (elem <= minimum) minimum = elem;\n  });\n  return minimum;\n  }\n};\n\nconst array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; \nconsole.log(minimum(array)); // 1\nconsole.log(minimum([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ])); // 1</code>\n\nAfter some struggle, I came up with this solution finally.\nBut it only checks up to <code>n^3</code> ~= 10^9. It seems you can pass the test cases when <code>7 > n^3</code>, despite I did add the border cases when I was debugging the test results.\n\n[Edit] Maybe my solution is too slow?

The custom operation requires 2 arguments, x and y, as well as the operator \"&\", \"*\" and the boundaries set in the defining function. The definitions of the operations (* = f f * ) indicate that the custom operation evaluates the given function (f) on the exterior region (D) based on the argument (x,y).\n\nTo compute f◆D, which requires use of f's f function, it is important to understand the meaning of & and \"*\" used in the definition. The & symbol represents the outermost expression, and \"*\" represents the inner nested expressions. This means that f◆D will be evaluated based on the arguments (x,y) using the specified function(s), and then a specific operation will be applied to the result.\n\nStarting with the first question, which asks to compute f◆D using f(x,y)=1, D: 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to this question should be:\n\nf◆D = ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy\nThe answer is a single number as required. To evaluate the integral ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, it is necessary to first determine the appropriate values of x and y that result in a non-zero fraction. In this case, only the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 satisfy all three arguments (x,y,f). Therefore, the integration region will be the area between these boundaries. The double integrals yields the value of the integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅1⋅dx·dy + ∫(2-1)⋅(3-2)⋅1⋅dx·dy = 2⋅2⋅1+1⋅1⋅dx·dy = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is:\n\nf◆D = [4]\n\nFor the second question, f(x,y)=xy, D:1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to the question should also be a single number. Note that the custom operation is the same in both questions, the only difference is the function definition, and the boundaries. Evaluating the function F by ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, yields:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = x⋅y⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration. In this case, the easiest way to find the appropriate bounds is to graphically observe the region defined by the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644949-90edfb0d-5963-4dc5-b2de-7d4ed72e4713.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral. The integral of this function is:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫xy⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫2⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅∫2⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅[(y+1)−(0+1)] = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅(y+1) = 8x⋅y2+8xy\nTherefore, the answer to the second question is:\n\nf◆D = [8(2)⋅32+8⋅(2⋅3)]=128\n\nFor the third question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand is:\n\nf(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y\nThe integration region has the same form as the region defined by 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 in the first question, so this question may be answered in a similar way:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅x2+y2⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nNote that the integrand is still constant and integration region has not changed:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅2⋅[(1+2)2+(0+1)2] = 6x2+6y2 = 6(x2+y2)\nTherefore, the answer to the third question is:\n\nf◆D = [6(12+32)]=40/3\n\nFor the fourth question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand and integration region are the same as in the previous question. Therefore, the integral can be evaluated:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(1+2)⋅(3-1)⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = ∫3⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫3⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644983-7a850cf2-36b9-4e30-b697-6b74bb9ab9d5.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫(x"}

Compute the domain and answer range of f○g. Make sure you clearly write the domain and answer range without commas, and make sure to use ‘}’ for answers that belong to both the domain and answer range.
