M must equal 1 because M is the first letter in MONEY, which is a multi-digit number, and cannot be 0.\n2. By examining the structure of the equation, S can only be 9. This is because S+1 (due to the carry over from adding D+E) must result in a 5 digit number, and 1+9 = 10 carries over to the next column.\n3. Analyzing the rest of the digits and possible numbers:\n   - O being 0 is not possible (M is 1 and the first digit of a number can't be 0). The next smallest possibility for O that satisfies O + 0 = E (from MORE + M = MONE(Y)) and supports an additional carry in the thousands place (from R + R = E) is 0, but since 0 is not eligible, O is 0.\n   - Thus, E must be 1+0 = 0+1 = 1 (but E can't be 1 because M is 1), therefore E should be a new number. Considering the possible sums and the carryover options from MORE+MORE, E should be higher but not 1. Hence, E=5 (considering O is 0).\n   - R must be 8 because R+R (where R is 8) + the carry 1 (from adding N and E) results in E=5.\n   - More so, N should be 6 because N + 1 (carry from adding N+E where E=5) results in Y=2. Additionally, when we add E (5) to O (0), we need to have a consistent equation, so we add a carry to the O in MORE, so N=6 fits.\n\nTo summarize the assignment:\n- [[S=9, E=5, N=6, D=7, M=1, O=0, R=8, Y=2]] \n\nTherefore, SEND+MORE=MONEY becomes 9567+1085=10652."}

We have distinct letters: E, A, T, H, P, L.\n2. APPLE is a 5-digit number and EAT, THAT are 3-digit numbers each.

Make an approximate guess or calculation to find a valid configuration of numbers (commonly solved via trial and error or more sophisticated mathematical techniques such as Diophantine equations).\n\nLet's proceed with one possible solution:\n   H = 8, E = 5, R = 6, S = 9, C = 1, O = 0, M = 3\n   \nCheck:\n   HERE = 8565\n   SHE = 965\n   COMES = 10305\n\n   8565 + 965 = 9530 which does not equal 10305, so let's revise.\n\nAfter several attempts and recalculations, we find:\n   H = 9, E = 3, R = 4, S = 1, C = 7, O = 0, M = 8\n\nCheck:\n   HERE = 9343\n   SHE = 193\n   COMES = 9536\n\n   9343 + 193 = 9536 which correctly equals 9536.\n\nThe configuration that works is:\n- H = 9\n- E = 3\n- R = 4\n- S = 1\n- C = 7\n- O = 0\n- M = 8\n\nSo, the answer is:\n[[H=9,E=3,R=4,S=1,C=7,O=0,M=8]]"}

To simplify the selection, let's assume:\nN = 1, U = 0, M = 2, B = 3, E = 4, R = 5\n\nThese assignments respect all the given rules:\n- Different letters have unique numbers.\n- The numbers range from 0-9.\n- The first letter (N) of the multi-digit number NUMBER does not represent 0.\n\nCalculate NUMBER:\nNUMBER = 102345\n2 * NUMBER = 2 * 102345 = 204690\n\nNow we assign the values to PUZZLE:\nP = 2, U = 0, Z = 4, L = 6, E = 9\n\nThus:\nPUZZLE = 204690\n\nThis result adheres to the puzzle rules, correctly accounting for uniqueness and positional rules for 0.\n\nSo the solution looks like this:\n[[N=1, U=0, M=2, B=3, E=4, R=5, P=2, Z=4, L=6, E=9]]\nNote: E appears twice, and in each instance, it should have the same value (E = 9) respecting the rule that each letter represents a unique number and will consistently represent the given value across the equation. There seems to be a typo for the second E, where it actually calculates 4 instead of 9 in PUZZLE. Correcting it, PUZZLE = 204694 rather than 204690."}

The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n\n2. Mandy used the sugar-free diet.\n\n3. The dieter who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nStep-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- From clue 5, we know Barbara lost 7 lbs, but her diet is not specified directly.\n- From clue 2, since Mandy is on the sugar-free diet, and from clue 1, the sugar-free diet results in losing 4 more pounds than the caveman diet, we can calculate weight losses once we know the weight lost on the caveman diet.\n- Let's examine Eula based on clue 4; she is either on the gluten-free diet or the caveman diet.\n- Depending on Eula’s diet (gluten-free or caveman), due to clue 3 stating the caveman diet lost more pounds than Eula did, she can't be on the caveman diet because it would conflict with the statement in clue 3. Thus, Eula must be on the gluten-free diet.\n- Given Eula’s gluten-free diet, Barbara must be the person on the caveman diet (as she is the only other name and diet left).\n- From clue 5 and the assignment of Barbara as the caveman dieter, this implies she lost 7 lbs.\n- From clue 1, Mandy (sugar-free diet) must have lost 7 lbs + 4 lbs = 11 lbs.\n- Since Barbara (caveman diet) lost 7 lbs and lost more pounds than Eula (clue 3), and Mandy lost 11 lbs, the only remaining reasonable value for Eula (gluten-free diet) is a weight lower than 7 lbs but also incremented in a sensible set of values. It could be 3 lbs or 5 lbs, but since 11 - 4 = 7 lbs for the caveman diet and considering Barbara lost this, and Mandy lost more, the probable value for Eula would be 3 lbs, as it sequentially fits the \"somewhat more\" directive effectively.\n\nThus, the puzzle summary is: \n\n- Eula lost 3 lbs and used the gluten-free diet.\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs and used the caveman diet.\n- Mandy lost 11 lbs and used the sugar-free diet.\n\nSetting this into the puzzle's demanded format:\n[[3 Eula Gluten-Free,5 Name Diet,7 Barbara Caveman,11 Mandy Sugar-Free]]\n\n(Note: Pounds lost for a friend not directly named is indicated hypothetically as 5 lbs to maintain sequence and since there is no contradiction, they might have lost 5 pounds with the unnamed diet.)"}

(But no month is given here.)\n\nGoing over the clues:\n- From clue 2 & 1, if one of the rockets (Cornick or another) that launches in March is by Rubicorp, the Gralax developed after it must launch in April.\n- Since the Gralax launches in April from our earlier reasoning and is after Rubicorp's rocket from clue 1, this must mean Rubicorp's rocket launches in March.\n- From clue 2, this aligns with the Rubicorp's entity being in March, meaning the other entity - Cornick, must be by Techtrin.\n- Given the Athios launches a month earlier than Cornick, and we know now that Cornick is by Techtrin not launching in March, the only possibility left for Athios's launch month is February, (as March is taken by Rubicorp's rocket), and hence Cornick in March.\n- That leaves January for SpaceZen’s Exatris, as it's the only month left and not stated.\n\nAs these companies are the only ones mentioned and all rockets have unique months and developers, it sums up all possibilities.\n\nThus, the arrangement is:\n[[January Exatris SpaceZen, February Athios Techtrin, March Cornick Rubicorp, April Gralax Rubicorp]]"}

For each row:\n   - Row 1: X + 2 + 6 + X = 33  \n     => 2 + 6 = 8  \n     => Remaining sum = 33 - 8 = 25   \n     => Break this into two parts for two Xs.   \n     X values are 9 and 16, such that 9 + 16 = 25.\n   - Row 2: 4 + X + X + 1 = 26  \n     => 4 + 1 = 5  \n     => Remaining sum = 26 - 5 = 21   \n     => X values are 10 and 11, such that 10 + 11 = 21.\n   - Row 3: X + 5 + X + 13 = 42  \n     => 5 + 13 = 18  \n     => Remaining sum = 42 - 18 = 24  \n     => X values are 8 and 16, such that 8 + 16 = 24.\n   - Row 4: X + 14 + 3 + X = 35  \n     => 14 + 3 = 17  \n     => Remaining sum = 35 - 17 = 18  \n     => X values are 8 and 10, such that 8 + 10 = 18.\n\n2. Assigning values while avoiding number repetition in the same column:\n    - By trial and checking with available column sums:\n      - R1: 25 = 25 or split as 8 & 17 etc., depending on options.\n      - R2: Must be 21 = 10 & 11 or switch depending on column requirements.\n      - For column sums to match, place suitable values.\n\nGrid fill:\n```\n25  2  6  0  |33\n4  10 11  1  |26\n8  5  16 13  |42\n1  14 3  17  |35\n-----------\n38 33 34 31\n```\n\nFinal filled matrix:\n```\n25 2 6 0\n4 10 11 1\n8 5 16 13\n1 14 3 17\n```\n\nThe answer from left to right and top to bottom:\n[[25 2 6 0, 4 10 11 1, 8 5 16 13, 1 14 3 17]]"}

Start with column 1, which needs a sum of 9. The possible weights in this column are 1, 2, 3, 4. Since the row 2 needs a sum of 8, it means the black cells in row 2 likely include high-weight cells.\n   - Fill cell (4,1) as it carries the highest weight and helps achieve the column sum quickly.\n   - By filling (4,1) and achieving a sum of 4, we now need 5 more for the column, suggesting (3,1) as it contributes 3, and (2,1) as it contributes 2.\n\n2. Column 2, needing a sum of 7, can leverage weights 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - Fill cell (4,2) to push towards the sum, providing 3 more.\n   - As we put a black in (2,1), placing black in (2,2) is logical as it contributes 2 to column 2 and helps achieve the sum of 8 for row 2.\n\n3. Column 3, needing 6, can reuse the logic.\n   - Fill (4,3) to achieve 3 just like before.\n   - Position (2,3) to capitalize on row 2’s required sum. Also, 3 from (4,3) and 2 from (2,3) leaves 1 more which must be from (1,3) to satisfy column sum exactly.\n\n4. Column 4 needing 6 can use positions (4,4) and (2,4).\n\n#### Step 2: Check Row Sums Alignment\n- Row 1 with sum of 4 is achieved by (1,3).\n- Row 2 with sum of 8 aligns with (2,1 + 2,2 + 2,3 + 2,4).\n- Row 3 with sum of 7 can follow with (3,1) and (3,2).\n- Row 4 which already completed needs no further checks.\n\n#### Final Filled Grid:\nX, X, 1, X  \n1, 1, 1, 1  \n1, 1, X, X  \n1, 1, 1, 1  \n\n#### Result Representation:\n[[X, X, 1, X, 4],[1, 1, 1, 1, 8],[1, 1, X, X, 7],[1, 1, 1, 1, 6],[9, 7, 6, 6]]"}

Row 1 needs the sum of weights to be 2.\n   - The only combination to sum to 2 using positions (1, 2, 3, 4) is by blackening the cell in position (1,2). \n\n2. Row 2 needs a sum of 9.\n   - To obtain a sum of 9 from positions (1, 2, 3, 4), blacken cells in positions (2, 3, 4).\n\n3. Row 3 and 4 each need a sum of 6.\n   - To get a sum of 6, blacken cells in (2, 4) for both rows.\n\nNow we check if these solutions satisfy the column constraints:\n\n- Column 1 totals to 0 as no cells in column 1 are blackened.\n- Column 2 has Row 2, 3, 4 black cells, so weights are (2 + 2 + 2) = 6, which matches column 2's constraint.\n- Column 3 has Row 2 blackened, so weight is 3.\n- Column 4 - Row 2, 3, 4 have black cells, weights are (4 + 3 + 3) = 10, which fulfills column 4's constraint.\n\nAfter validating these matches with constraints, the final blackening of cells would be:\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nTranslate blackened cells into \"1\" and unblackened into \"0\":\n0 1 0 0,\n0 1 1 1,\n0 0 0 1,\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 \n\nTherefore, the solution for this matrix in the required format: [[0 1 0 0, 0 1 1 1, 0 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1, 0 0 1 0]]"}

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to blacken cells in such a way that the sum of the numerical weights of all the black cells in each row and column equals the numbers given at the end of each respective row and column. Let's start by analyzing the sums given for each row and column and try to determine where the black cells should be. \n\nWe have a 4x4 grid based on the number of sums provided at the ends of rows and columns. \n\n### Step-by-step Deduction:\n1. **Column Sum Analysis**: \n   - The first column must sum to 5. This sum can be achieved by blackening cells in this column at position 1 (weight 1) and 4 (weight 4), totaling 1 + 4 = 5. \n   - The second column must sum to 4. This can be achieved by blackening the cell at position 4, which has a weight of 4.\n   - The third column must sum to 7. This can be achieved by blackening cells at positions 2 (weight 2) and 4 (weight 5), totaling 2 + 5 = 7.\n   - The fourth column must sum to 2. This sum can only be achieved by blackening the cell at position 2, which has a weight of 2.\n   \n2. **Row Sum Analysis**:\n   - The first row must sum to 1. The only column left with the possibility of a weight 1 is in position 4. Therefore, blacken position 4.\n   - The second row must sum to 4. The only available option from the column analysis to get the sum 4 is in column 1, position 2 (weight 2).\n   - The third row must sum to 3, given the remaining cells, we only have position 3 in column 3 available (weight 3).\n   - The fourth row must sum to 6, and the cells that can achieve this are position 4 in column 1 (weight 4) and position 2 in column 4 (weight 2).\n\nPutting it all together in the grid, replace \"X\" with \"1\" where blackening occurs and \"0\" where it doesn't:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 → The black cell at position 4 (weight 1)\nRow 2: 1 0 0 0 → The black cell at position 1 in column 1 (weight 2)\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 → The black cell at position 3 in column 3 (weight 3)\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 → The black cells at position 1 in column 1 (weight 4) and position 4 in column 4 (weight 2)\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis above, the correct blackened cells in formations of a grid are encoded as:\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n[[0 0 0 1, 1 0 0 0, 0 0 1 0, 1 0 0 1]]"}

The highest possible positions weighted are 5, 4, and 3 (5+4+3 = 12) which is too short, so we need positions 5 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 15 would work. But since we need exactly 13, best fitting positions are 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 13.\n- Row 2 needs to sum to 3. The best fit position (lowest weights) is 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Row 3 needs to sum to 14. The best fitting positions are 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n- Row 4 needs to sum to 13. The same as row 1, positions can be 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 13.\n- Row 5 needs to sum to 12. The best fitting positions are 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.\n\nColumn analysis:\n- Column 1 needs to sum to 5. Use positions 1 + 4 = 5.\n- Column 2 needs to sum to 3. Use positions 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Column 3 needs to sum to 15. Use all positions 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\n- Column 4 needs to sum to 13. Use positions 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13.\n- Column 5 needs to sum to 13. Use positions 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13.\n\nMatching these to the grid systematically for every cell:\n\n- 1,1 = 0 (no black cell needed for column sum)\n- 1,2 = 1 (needed for row sum)\n- 1,3 = 1 \n- 1,4 = 1\n- 1,5 = 1\n- 2,1 = 0\n- 2,2 = 1 (column and row sum)\n- 2,3 = 1\n- 2,4 = 0\n- 2,5 = 0\n- 3,1 = 0\n- 3,2 = 0 \n- 3,3 = 1 (column and row sum)\n- 3,4 = 1\n- 3,5 = 1\n- 4,1 = 1 \n- 4,2 = 0\n- 4,3 = 1 (column and row sum)\n- 4,4 = 1\n- 4,5 = 1\n- 5,1 = 1\n- 5,2 = 1 (needed for column sum)\n- 5,3 = 1\n- 5,4 = 1\n- 5,5 = 1\n\nFinal input grid based on the rule:\n\n0 1 1 1 1,\n0 1 1 0 0,\n0 0 1 1 1,\n1 0 1 1 1,\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nThe final answer presented from left to right, top to bottom:\n\n[[0 1 1 1 1, 0 1 1 0 0, 0 0 1 1 1, 1 0 1 1 1, 1 1 1 1 1]]"}

This doesn't meet the target exactly, so we need to adjust.\n   - **Row 2 requires a sum of 4:** Blacken cell in position 4.\n   - **Row 3 requires a sum of 10:** Possible by blackening cells 4 and 6 (4+6=10).\n   - **Row 4 requires a sum of 12:** Achievable by blackening cells in positions 6 (as 5+6 doesn't meet the target).\n   - **Row 5 requires a sum of 3:** Blacken cell in position 3.\n  \n2. **Column Constraints:**\n   - **Column 1 sum of 3:** Blacken cell in row 3.\n   - **Column 2 sum of 4:** Using above rows, need to blacken cell in row 4 (as summing any lower positions like 1 or 2 wouldn't reach 4 without surpassing the row total set previously).\n   - **Column 3 sum of 13:** Since Row 5 already has a blackened cell here, we add Row 4 cell (sum already 5), blackening Row 1 gives us the closest without contradicting (1+3+5=9, requiring addition).\n   - **Column 4 sum of 7:** Blacken cells in Rows 2 and 3 (2+4=6, closer).\n   - **Column 5 sum of 1:** This requires blackening just the first row because position 1 sums to 1.\n   - **Column 6 sum of 8:** Blacken cells in Row 1 (contribution 1) gives 1, so blacken in Row 6 too (6+1 ≠ 8, recheck Row constraints).\n\n#### Filled Grid (1 denotes a blackened cell and 0 denotes white):\n- Row 1: [0 0 0 0 1 1]\n- Row 2: [0 0 0 1 0 0]\n- Row 3: [0 0 1 0 0 1]\n- Row 4: [0 0 1 0 0 1]\n- Row 5: [0 0 1 0 0 0]\n\nPut into formatted response:\n[[0 0 0 1 0 0, 0 1 0 0 0 0, 0 0 1 0 0 1, 0 0 1 0 0 1, 0 0 1 0 0 0]]"}

Let's analyze the provided grid and numbers:\n\nThe last row seems to reflect the pattern where the numbers increase gradually then revert based on what suits the board: \n\n1. Row 8 shows a sequence from 1 to 8 then jumps to 11, 14, then higher numbers 65, 68, 71. \n2. The sequence is completed from 1-8, likely to be connected near these.\n3. The other numbers such as 35, 34, 43, and so forth have gaps that suggest these are part of the row continuity in the central bands.\n\nLet's start from the known number positions and fill out the puzzle:\n\n- 14 is next to 11 (right side), and 65 is to 14’s immediate right, 68 to 65’s right, and 71 to 68’s right.\n- From 1 upward: 2 is in row 7 column 2. From 2, 3 comes before 2 as it cannot fit in row 6 or row 7 to the left due to isolation, thus 3 should be in row 8 to the right of 1.\n- Filling gaps next to 29 and 35; 29 downwards connect to 30, 31, 32.\n- Similarly, for 35 upwards: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 connect up to 43.\n- Investigate remaining blanks. 22 goes downwards to connect to 20, 21 and upwards connect to 23 and then most likely loops around to connect to 29.\n- 56 connects downwards to 55, on the row above 51, then continues to 54, 53, 52 in the row upwards as they occur next to 50, 51.\n- The bottom rows would continue from 70, filling horizontally, tracing back to the 65 series in the row above.\n- Ensure every missing number is placed considering the horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal adjacency. Checking isolated numbers and confirming continuity of sequence.\n\nThe filled grid, following the rules and the sequence, sums up to:\n\n`X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X`\n`X  35  34  33  42  41  40  51  X`\n`X  32  31  30  39  38  37  56  X`\n`X  29  28  27  26  25  24  79  X`\n`X  22  21  20  19  18  17  80  X`\n`X  19  X  X  X  X  X  81  X`\n`X  2  3  4  5  6  7  X  70  X`\n`X  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X`\n`X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X`\n\nThus, the numbers list:\n[[X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X, X  35  34  33  42  41  40  51  X, X  32  31  30  39  38  37  56  X, X  29  28  27  26  25  24  79  X, X  22  21  20  19  18  17  80  X, X  19  X  X  X  X  X  81  X, X  2  3  4  5  6  7  X  70  X, X  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X, X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X]]"}

Identify hint numbers on the grid and determine how many squares will be included in each island based on these hints.\n2. Build islands so that only one hint number is in each resulting area and the number of squares in that area matches the hint number.\n3. Walls (A) separate the islands vertically and horizontally and no 2x2 square of \"A\"s should be formed. \n\nApproach:\nFor each hint:\n- Surround the hint with enough Xs and fill the rest with A to satisfy the hint number.\n\nThe grid we have is:\n```\nX X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X\n2 X X 4 X X 3\nX X X X X 6 X\nX X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X\nX X X X X X 6\n```\nStep by step filling:\n1. The hint \"2\" can be surrounded simply with 1 additional X and walls around.\n2. Similarly, the hint \"3\", \"6\" at 4th row and \"6\" at 7th row can be surrounded by enough Xs, and we use walls to meet the required conditions.\n3. For \"4\", we will have a larger island surrounded by more walls appropriately. \n\nFollowing the constraints and ensuring no 2x2 square of \"A\" are formed, the output becomes:\n```\nA A A A A A A\nA 2 X A 4 X A\nA A A A A X A\nA X X A X 6 A\nA A A A A A A\nA X X X X X A\nA A A A A A 6\n```\nEach hint number controls an area exactly equal to its number:\n- 2 controls an L-shaped area of 2 squares.\n- 3 controls a vertical row of 3 squares.\n- 4 controls a 2x2 shape located right beside it.\n- 6 in the 5th row controls a L-shaped block of 6 squares.\n- 6 in the 7th row controls 6 squares to the left of it.\n\nRewriting the output in the final requested format:\n```\n[[A A A A A A A,A 2 X A 4 X A,A A A A A X A,A X X A X 6 A,A A A A A A A,A X X X X X A,A A A A A A 6]]\n```"}

No 2x2 or larger square sequences of walls should be formed. This puzzle is a type of Nurikabe, a logic puzzle from Japan.\n\n### Steps to Solution:\n\n1. **Placing the Initial Hint Islands:**\n   - The '2' at position (1,3) needs one more 'X' adjacent to it, hence:\n     - The most straightforward adjacency without conflicting with the '3' on (1,6) would be upward or downward since placing it on (1,2) conflicts with '1' on (2,2).\n   - The '1' at (2,2) stands alone so surrounding it with 'A's.\n   - The same principle applies to the '4' at (4,3), '1' at (5,1), and other standalone numbers. \n\n2. **Wall Placement for Separation:**\n   - All grid squares adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to the hint number island that are blank but not part of that island should be converted to 'A' to form walls.\n\n3. **Infilling Remaining Squares:**\n   - Based on the remaining blank squares ('X'), ensure no 2x2 blocks of walls ('A') are formed. Some squares must therefore remain 'X' or convert to 'A' to extend the wall properly between islands.\n\n### Applying these Steps:\n\n- Row 1: 'X', 'X', 2, 'A', 'A', 3, 'A', 'X'\n- Row 2: 'A', 1, 'A', 'A', 'A', 'X', 'X', 'X'\n- Row 3: 'X', 'A', 'X', 'X', 3, 'A', 'X', 'X'\n- Row 4: 'X', 'X', 4, 'A', 'A', 'A', 3, 'A'\n- Row 5: 1, 'A', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 3, 'A'\n- Row 6: 'A', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'A', 'A', 'X'\n- Row 7: 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 3, 'A', 'X', 'X'\n- Row 8: 4, 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'X', 'X', 'X'\n\n### Final Output Format:\n[[X X 2 A A 3 A X,A 1 A A A X X X,X A X X 3 A X X,X X 4 A A A 3 A,1 A X X X X 3 A,A X X X X A A X,X X X X 3 A X X,4 A A A A X X X]]"}

(1,1)(1,2)(1,3):6+   \n   This means the sum of the cells (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) must be equal to 6.\n\n2. (1,4)(2,4):4*    \n   The product of the cells (1,4) and (2,4) must be 4.\n\n3. (2,3)(3,3)(3,4):36*  \n   The product of the cells (2,3), (3,3), and (3,4) must be 36.\n\n4. (2,1)(3,1):2÷     \n   The result of the division of the values in (2,1) and (3,1) in some order must be 2.\n\n5. (4,3)(4,4):2÷   \n   The result of the division of the values in (4,3) and (4,4) in some order must be 2.\n\n6. (2,2)(3,2):1-   \n   The difference between cells (2,2) and (3,2) in some order must be 1.\n\n7. (4,1)(4,2):1-   \n   The difference between cells (4,1) and (4,2) in some order must be 1.\n\nNow, deducing possible grid numbers:\n- Possible numbers based on the grid size (4x4) are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n- Only the numbers from 1 to 4 will be used in all operations and placements. Each number can be used only once per row and per column.\n\nAssuming placements for values:\n\n1. For (1,4)(2,4):4*, possible pairs are {2,2} or {4,1}.\n   If we use {1, 4}, then in row 1, we have to make sums to 6 using (1,1)(1,2)(1,3). A working combination is 3, 2, 1 adding to 6.\n\n2. For (2,1)(3,1):2÷, the pairs could be {2,1} or {4,2}.\n   With {2, 1}, we would place 2 for (2,1) and 1 for (3,1).\n\n3. For (2,3)(3,3)(3,4):36*, possible combinations are {4, 3, 3}.\n\n4. For (4,3)(4,4):2÷, if (3,3)=(3,4)=(3), then (4,3)=(4,4) must not use 3. If {2,1} are used, then possible pairs left are {4, 2}.\n\n5. For (2,2)(3,2):1-, with potential values, not used in other regions.\n\n6. For (4,1)(4,2):1-, we left with possible remaining numbers.\n\nHence the grid is:\n- Row 1: 3, 2, 1, 4\n- Row 2: 2, 3, 4, 1\n- Row 3: 1, 4, 3, 2 \n- Row 4: 4, 3, 2, 1 \n\nThus, the filled 4x4 grid is:\n[[3 2 1 4,2 3 4 1,1 4 3 2,4 3 2 1]]"}

Again, possible pairs are (2,1), where 2 ÷ 1 = 2.\n\n3. For region (1,2)(1,3):1-\n   This region must have a subtraction result of 1. Possible combinations are (2,1).\n\n4. For region (1,4)(2,4):8*\n   Products resulting in 8 can be (2,4).\n\n5. For region (2,2)(2,3):3*\n   Products resulting in 3 are (1,3).\n\n6. For region (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+\n   Four digits summing to 13 without repeat and from 1 to 4. For this, possible combination is (4,3,4,2) or (3,4,3,3). To avoid repetition 3,2,4,4 is reasonable.\n\n7. For region (4,3)(4,4):2-\n   Subtraction equaling 2, where possible combinations are (4,2).\n\nProposed numbers:\nRow 1: 2 2 1 4\nRow 2: 1 3 4 2\nRow 3: 3 4 2 1 \nRow 4: 4 3 1 2\n\nRevising the grid following row and column distinct rule, and to match target values in regions:\n- (1,1) and (2,1) with division 2 should be (2,1).\n- (3,3) and (3,4) with division 2 should be (2,1) but repeating in rows shifted.\n- (1,2) and (1,3) subtraction to 1: (2,1).\n- (1,4) and (2,4) multiplication to 8: (2,4).\n- (2,2) and (2,3) multiplication to 3: (1,3).\n- (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2) summing to 13: (3,4,4,2).\n- (4,3) and (4,4) subtraction to 2: (4,2).\n\nResulting setup:\n2 3 1 4\n1 4 3 2\n3 4 2 1\n4 2 1 3\n\nThus, the final puzzle solution is:\n[[2 3 1 4, 1 4 3 2, 3 4 2 1, 4 2 1 3]]"}

Since 2 is at (2,1), by definition no smaller numbers, hence (2,1) should be greater than any number left to it except 1. As `3 > 2`, (3,1) must be 3 or 4. Since (3,1) needs to be greater than (3,2), most minimal arrangement would be (3,1) as 3 (if (3,2) is 1 or 2).\n\n2. Apply (1,1) > (1,2) > (1,3):\n- To maximize minimal placements and allow room for other rows, let's consider (1,1) as 4, then (1,2) could be 3 or 2, and (1,3) could be 2 or 1; selecting higher values for earlier cells because smaller ones must be greater than more constrained larger later cells.\n\n3. Apply (2,3) < (2,4):\n- Given 4 in the first row, columns 3 and 4 need to be assigned smallest available which doesn't conflict with other conditions; let's try with (2,3) as 1, so (2,4) can be 3.\n\n4. Since (2,2) must be greater than (3,2) and it can't be 1 or 2 (already in row), and 4 is used above, (2,2) must be 4. Hence, (3,2) can be set to 2 considering (3,1) as 3.\n\n5. To finalize and review for any missed mistakes:\n- Row 1 (4, 3, 2, 1) satisfies all conditions for that row.\n- Row 2 is now (2, 4, 1, 3).\n- Row 3 has (3, [2 or 1], X, X) needing 4 in either third or fourth place; putting 4 in fourth place.\n- Row 4 then adjusts based on options left fitting into remaining spots without violations.\n\n### Step 4: Final Grid Solution\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 2 4 1\n1 1 3 2\n```\nHowever, we find (4,2) = 1 conflicts. Correct placements by updating:\n- (3,2) = 1, and (3,3) = 2; satisfies all inequalities.\n- For Row 4: (4,2) = 2, (4,3) = 3 allows using 4 without conflict.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 4 2\n1 2 3 4\n```\nOutput: [[4 3 2 1,2 4 1 3,3 1 4 2,1 2 3 4]]"}

Apply inequality constraints:\n   - (1,4) < (1,5): 5th element of the 1st row is greater than the 4th element.\n   - (1,2) < (2,2): 2nd column of the top 2 rows follows an increasing order.\n   - (2,3) < (3,3): 3rd element of the 2nd row is lesser than the 3rd element of the 3rd row.\n   - (3,4) > (4,4): 4th element of the 3rd row is greater than the 4th element of the fourth row.\n   - (4,1) > (4,2): 1st element of the 4th row is greater than the 2nd element.\n   - (4,3) < (5,3): 3rd element of the 4th row is less than the 3rd element of the 5th row.\n   - (5,2) > (5,3): 2nd element of the 5th row is greater than the 3rd element.\n   - (5,3) < (5,4): 3rd element of the 5th row is less than the 4th element.\n\nGiven these constraints and using deduction:\n\n### Fill the grid\n- Row 1: Can't have 1 (row 2) and not 4 (row 3), can't be 5 as (1,4) has to be less than (1,5). Starts with numbers that fit these constraints.\n- Maintain uniqueness in each row and column, respecting all given constraints.\n- Gradually fill in numbers by eliminating impossibilities and using clues given by inequality constraints.\n\nFinally, we proceed with filling details:\n1. Start placing numbers in cells satisfying all individual row/column and inequality constraints.\n\nApplying logic for each placement:\n- R1 could be [3, 2, 5, 4, 5] respecting (1,2) and (1,4)<(1,5)\n  - However, since R2 starts with 1 and 1<2, thus spread remaining numbers in R2.\n  - Similarly, handle each row, placement by placement, ensuring global and local conformity.\n\nAfter careful placement respecting all rules and constraints, the final solved puzzle (hypothetical) could be:\n[[2 3 4 5 1, 1 2 3 4 5, 4 5 1 3 2, 5 1 2 4 3, 3 4 5 1 2]]\n\nThe solution should obey all (row, column) inequalities and fill the grid from 1 to 5 in each row and column without repetition while satisfying inequalities. A correct final solution methodically verifies each placement to honor these rules."}

The '7' at position (1,6): \n   - Cover 2 spaces to the left (since moving to right is blocked by the grid edge after one space), 4 spaces upwards, and 1 space downward.\n\n2. The '7' at position (2,3):\n   - Cover 2 spaces upwards, 4 spaces to the right, and 1 space downward.\n\n3. The '7' at position (3,2):\n   - Cover 2 spaces to the left, 1 space downwards, and 4 spaces right (we make it right heavy considering position distribution).\n\n4. The '7' at position (4,4):\n   - Cover 1 space to the left, 2 space downward, 1 space upward, and 3 spaces to the right.\n\n5. The '5' at position (5,7):\n   - Cover 2 spaces left (since it is close to the edge), and 3 spaces down.\n\n6. The '9' at position (6,7):\n   - This can cover 2 squares left, 1 upwards, 5 downward, and 1 right.\n\n7. The '5' at position (7,5):\n   - Cover 2 spaces left, 2 upward, and 1 to the right.\n   \n8. The '9' at position (8,1):\n   - Cover 2 spaces to the right, 3 spaces downward, and 4 upwards handling the row end.\n\nUsing the above described arrow flows for each number, populate the grid while ensuring no arrows cross and all X squares are covered:\n\n```\n→ → → → ↓ 7 ↓ ,\n→ → 7 → → → → ,\n↓ 7 → → → → → ,\n↓ → → 7 → → → ,\n↓ → → → → → 5 ,\n→ → → → → → ↓ 9 ,\n→ → → → 5 ← ← ,\n9 → → → → → → ←\n```\n\nConvert this grid into the appropriate output format:\n[[→ → → → ↓ 7 ↓ ,→ → 7 → → → → ,↓ 7 → → → → → ,↓ → → 7 → → → ,↓ → → → → → 5 ,→ → → → → → ↓ 9 ,→ → → → 5 ← ← ,9 → → → → → → ←]]"}

Region A:\n   - Coordinates (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1).\n   - Choose domino vertical placements: [(1,1)(2,1)].\n\n2.

Region D:\n   - Coordinates (2,4) and (2,5).\n   - Choose horizontal or vertical, will consider [(2,4)(2,5)], but since domino crossing region boundary is allowed, I need to avoid it touching other dominoes. Thus, better suited will be [(2,4)(3,4)] diagonal touching with C.\n\n5. Region E:\n   - Coordinates (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (4,6).\n   - Choose domino vertical placements: [(4,2)(4,3)].\n\n6. Region F:\n   - Coordinates (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4).\n   - It is larger but entry suggests 2 cells only, thus giving different sections: [(5,1)(5,2)].\n\n7. Region G:\n   - Coordinates (6,2), (6,3), and (6,4).\n   - Place domino horizontal if no conflict: [(6,3)(6,4)].\n\n8.
