This can be represented as \"p1 =::> p2\" because it is essentially saying \"if 4 is even, then 5 is odd.\"\n\n(2) If 4 is even, then 5 is even.\nThis directly translates to \"if p1, then p3\" where p3 represents \"5 is even.\" However, since we are only working with p1 (4 is even) and p2 (5 is odd), we need to adjust p3 to fit within our given propositions. Since p2 is \"5 is odd,\" the negation of p2 would be \"5 is even.\" Thus, this proposition is symbolized as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(3) Only 4 being even makes 5 even.\nThis statement implies that 5 being even is exclusively contingent on 4 being even. There's a subtle difference here from the previous proposition in that it suggests the uniqueness of this condition. However, given the logical connectives at our disposal, and considering the constraint of only using p1 and p2, this can be closely represented as a combination of the previous ideas, emphasizing that if 4 is not even, then 5 is not even (which is equivalent to saying 5 is odd). Symbolically, this could be \"~(~p1 & ~p2)\", meaning it's not the case that both 4 is not even and 5 is not odd, which implies that if 4 is even, then 5 is not odd (i.e., 5 is even). However, to maintain the simplicity and directly address the given propositions without introducing new logical structures, this can also be seen as reiterating the point made in (2), focusing on the uniqueness of the condition, so we'll keep it as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(4) 4 is even if and only if 5 is odd.\nThis is a straightforward biconditional statement, meaning 4 is even is a necessary and sufficient condition for 5 to be odd. This is symbolized as \"p1 = p2.\"\n\nPutting it all together in the requested format:\n\n[[p1 =::> p2];[p1 =::> ~p2];[p1 =::> ~p2];[p1 = p2]]\n\nNote: For (3), there's a nuance in interpretation due to the phrasing \"Only...makes,\" which could imply a uniqueness of the condition that makes it a bit complex to capture precisely with the given logical structure. However, given the constraints and aiming for the closest representation while adhering strictly to the provided propositions (p1, p2) and their negations, the simplification chosen aims to reflect the essence of the statement in the given logical framework."}

We aim to express the result in the simplest form using only `|`, `&`, and `!`.\n\n### Expression 1: !(p>(p|q))&r\n\n1. Apply rule (10) to transform implication into disjunction:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | (p|q)\n\n2. Apply rule (5) to distribute `p` over `|q`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | p | q\n\n3. Apply rule (8) to simplify `p | !p`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: 1 | q ::=:: 1 (since 1 | q is always true)\n\n4. Negate the result from step 3:\n   !(p>(p|q)) ::=:: !1 ::=:: 0\n\n5. Finally, apply rule (7) to distribute `0` over `&r`:\n   !(p>(p|q))&r ::=:: 0&r ::=:: 0\n\n### Expression 2: p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)\n\n1. Apply rule (10) to transform implication into disjunction:\n   ((p|q)&!p)>q ::=:: !((p|q)&!p) | q\n\n2. Apply rule (6) to distribute negation over conjunction:\n   !((p|q)&!p) ::=:: !(p|q) | !!p\n\n3. Apply rule (6) again:\n   !(p|q) | !!p ::=:: !p & !q | p\n\n4. Combine with rule (5):\n   !p & !q | p ::=:: (!p | p) & (!q | p) ::=:: 1 & (!q | p) ::=:: !q | p\n\n5. So, ((p|q)&!p)>q simplifies to !q | p. Now, we can rewrite the original expression:\n   p&(((p|q)&!p)>q) ::=:: p&(!q | p)\n\n6. Apply rule (5) to distribute `p` over `|`:\n   p&(!q | p) ::=:: (p&!q) | (p&p)\n\n7. Apply rule (2) and then rule (7):\n   (p&!q) | (p&p) ::=:: (p&!q) | p ::=:: p\n\nNow, we format the simplified expressions as requested:\n\n- For Expression 1: `[[];[]]` (since it simplifies to `0`, there's no variable left)\n- For Expression 2: `[p;[]]` (it simplifies to just `p`)\n\nTherefore, the answers formatted as logical expressions are:\n\n- Expression 1: `[[];[]]`\n- Expression 2: `[p;[]]`"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n(2) (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the validity of the given equivalences, we will apply the defined logical operations and basic equivalences provided in the logical rule set.\n\n### Question 1: (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n\nFirst, we translate `\u21d3` into its equivalent form using the basic equivalences:\n- `A \u21d3 B` ::=:: `!A & !B` (Equivalence 16)\n\nApplying this to both sides of our equivalence:\n- `(p\u21d3q)\u21d3r` becomes `(!(!p & !q)) & !r`\n- `p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)` becomes `!p & !(!q & !r)`\n\nNow, we simplify using De Morgan's laws (Equivalence 6):\n- `(!(!p & !q)) & !r` becomes `(p | q) & !r`\n- `!p & !(!q & !r)` becomes `!p & (q | r)`\n\nThese two expressions are not equivalent, as `(p | q) & !r` is not the same as `!p & (q | r)`. Thus, the first equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Question 2: (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\n\nSimilarly, we translate `\u21d1` into its equivalent form:\n- `A \u21d1 B` ::=:: `!A | !B` (Equivalence 15)\n\nApplying this to both sides of our equivalence:\n- `(p\u21d1q)\u21d1r` becomes `!(!(!p | !q)) | !r`\n- `p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)` becomes `!p | !(!(!q | !r))`\n\nNow, we simplify using De Morgan's laws and double negation (Equivalence 1):\n- `!(!(!p | !q)) | !r` becomes `(!p | !q) | !r`\n- `!p | !(!(!q | !r))` becomes `!p | (!q | !r)`\n\nThese two expressions are equivalent, as `(!p | !q) | !r` is the same as `!p | (!q | !r)` due to the associative property of `|` (Equivalence 4). Thus, the second equivalence is valid.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer, following the provided format, is:\n`[[B];[A]]`\n\nThis indicates that the first equivalence is not valid (B), and the second equivalence is valid (A)."}

If `q` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Shanghai), then `r` and `p` must be false. This would make the first part of the expression `!p&q&!r` false, but since `p` is false, the second part `p&!q&r` is also false. This contradicts the fact that `E` must denote a situation where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect. Therefore, `q` cannot be true on its own.\n\n2. If `r` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Hangzhou), then `p` and `q` must be false. This would make both parts of `E` false, which is also a contradiction. Thus, `r` cannot be true on its own.\n\n3. If `p` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Suzhou), then `q` and `r` must be false. This makes the first part of `E` false (`!p&q&!r`), but the second part `p&!q&r` simplifies to `p&!q&!r` since `r` is false, which matches the requirement for one of the persons to be entirely correct (in this case, Person B with `p&!q`). This situation also fits the condition where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that Professor Wang is from Suzhou (`p` is true, `q` and `r` are false).\n\nNow, let's analyze who got what correct:\n\n- Person A: `!p&q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person A is entirely incorrect.\n- Person B: `p&!q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person B is entirely correct.\n- Person C: `!q&!r` - Since `q` is false and `r` is also false, Person C is partially correct because only one part of their statement is right (the part about not being from Shanghai), and the other part (about not being from Hangzhou when he is actually not) is redundant given our knowledge, making it neither fully right nor fully wrong in context.\n\nTherefore, the answer format with the correct assignments is:\n\n`[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: A]]`"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Basic Form**: A formula is a basic form if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\). This means that the formula must have at least one term where all propositional variables are negated (since the false assignment corresponds to \\(1111\\) in binary, or \\(F\\) in hexadecimal, for 4 propositional variables).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even form if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. In hexadecimal, even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. For 4 propositional variables, these correspond to specific truth assignments.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible paired conjunctive terms, ranging from \\(m_0\\) to \\(m_{F}\\) in hexadecimal. For a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must contain \\(m_0\\) (to satisfy the basic form condition) and can only contain other terms with even indices (to satisfy the all-even form condition).\n\nThe even indices for 4 propositional variables are: \\(m_0\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_4\\), \\(m_6\\), \\(m_8\\), \\(m_{A}\\), \\(m_{C}\\), \\(m_{E}\\).\n\nFor a formula to be both basic and all-even, it must include \\(m_0\\) and can optionally include any combination of the other even-indexed terms. The number of such formulas corresponds to the power set of the set of even-indexed terms excluding \\(m_0\\) (since \\(m_0\\) is mandatory), minus one (to exclude the case with no terms other than \\(m_0\\), since we've already counted it as a basic form).\n\nThere are 7 other even-indexed terms besides \\(m_0\\). The power set of a set with 7 elements has \\(2^7\\) members. However, we exclude the case with no additional terms (since we're counting combinations that include \\(m_0\\)), leaving \\(2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\\) possible combinations.\n\nThus, there are 127 formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form, formatted as required:\n\n```\n[127]\n```"}

The rule states that if we have two clauses `C1 = C3 \u2228 L` and `C2 = C4 \u2228 L'`, where `L` and `L'` are complements, then `dispel(C1, C2) = C3 \u2228 C4`.\n\nGiven `C1 = \u00acp \u2228 q \u2228 r` and `C2 = p \u2228 \u00acr \u2228 \u00acs`, we need to find a literal and its complement in the two clauses. However, upon inspection, we see that there is no direct literal and its complement between `C1` and `C2` that would allow for an immediate resolution step with the provided literals. The complements between `C1` and `C2` are `r` and `\u00acr`, but since `r` is not alone in `C1` and `\u00acr` is not alone in `C2`, we cannot directly apply the resolution rule as described without first simplifying or making assumptions based on other resolution steps.\n\nThe defined rule assumes a direct resolution between two clauses based on a single literal and its complement, which is not the case here with the given `C1` and `C2`. Therefore, to apply the rule directly as stated, we would first need to either introduce more clauses or consider the conjunction of these clauses with others that would allow for the proper application of the resolution rule.\n\nGiven the strict interpretation of the provided rule and the lack of a direct application to the given `C1` and `C2` without additional steps, `dispel(C1, C2)` does not result in a resolution that can be expressed directly in the form of `C3 \u2228 C4` without further resolution steps or additional clauses to facilitate the process.\n\nThus, with the provided `C1` and `C2` and adhering strictly to the rule's definition, the answer is that there is no direct application of `dispel(C1, C2)` resulting in a simple disjunctive clause `C3 \u2228 C4` based on the immediate complements `r` and `\u00acr`. Therefore, the answer in the requested format would be `[[]]`, indicating that no new clause is derived from the direct resolution of `C1` and `C2` according to the given rule without additional context or steps.\n\nHowever, if one were to perform a full resolution procedure, additional steps might involve creating new clauses by resolving `\u00acp` with `p` or `q` with `\u00acs` after resolving `r` and `\u00acr`, but this would require more than one resolution step and the introduction of intermediate clauses, which is beyond the scope of the question as it is looking for a direct application of `dispel(C1, C2)`."}

Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2). The proposition states that both of these properties hold for the number 2. Thus, we have:\n- `[F(2) & G(2)]`\n\n(2) If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime.\nFirst, we express \"2 is prime\" as G(2). For \"4 is not prime\", we negate the predicate for \"4 is prime\", which is G(4), resulting in \u223cG(4). The implication between these two is then:\n- `[G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]`\n\n(3) Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime.\nThis statement suggests that if 6 is prime, then 2 must be the only prime number. To represent this, we use an implication where the premise is \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) and the conclusion is that for all numbers, if they are prime, they must be equal to 2. This can be represented by saying for all x, if x is prime and x is not 2, then this is not possible (assuming equality is represented by EQ(x, y) for x and y being equal):\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 Ax((G(x) & \u223cEQ(x, 2)) \u21d2 \u223c(x))]`\nHowever, given the constraint of 0-ary predicates and the fact that we are not explicitly given an equality predicate, we can interpret this to mean that if 6 is prime, then any prime number other than 2 is not prime, adapting the statement to fit the 0-ary predicate structure:\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]`\nHere, `x \u2260 2` is represented as `\u223cEQ(x, 2)` but adjusted for the constraint of 0-ary predicates, understanding `x \u2260 2` as a given, interpretable condition rather than a predicate in its own right.\n\n(4) Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime.\nThis statement can be interpreted as \"if 6 is not prime, then 4 is prime\". We negate the predicate for \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) to represent \"6 is not prime\" (\u223cG(6)), and the conclusion is \"4 is prime\" (G(4)). The implication is then:\n- `[\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]`\n\nPutting all the answers in the requested format:\n`[[F(2) & G(2)]; [G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]; [G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]; [\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]]`\n\nNote: For the third proposition, the interpretation adheres to the 0-ary predicate constraints but approximates the intended logical structure, given the limitations of the provided predicates and the absence of equality predicates or direct numerical comparisons in the 0-ary predicate system."}

We identify the relevant properties and objects, apply the given logical operations, and ensure the output adheres to the specified notation and symbols.\n\nGiven:\n- E = \ud835\udc38 = natural numbers N.\n- a\u2032 = 0.\n- Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y and gJ(x, y) = x * y. However, only gJ(x, y) is relevant to the formula since it's the only one referenced.\n- Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nFormula to implement: \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\u2192F(x,y)\n\nStep 1: Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38.\nSince \ud835\udc38 is defined as the set of natural numbers N, we work under the domain of natural numbers.\n\nStep 2: Replace entity constants a with a\u2032.\nIn this case, a is replaced with its assignment a\u2032, which is defined as 0.\n\nStep 3: Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with gJ.\nSince g(x,a) is in the formula, we replace it with its implementation under \ud835\udc3d, which is x * y (in this case, a is replaced with 0, so we have x * 0).\n\nStep 4: Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\nThe predicate symbol F in the formula is replaced with its implementation under \ud835\udc3d, which is FJ, denoting x = y.\n\nImplementing these steps, we replace the formula components as follows:\n\n- Replace a with a\u2032: a \u2192 0.\n- Replace g(x,y) with gJ(x,y) = x * y and applying a\u2032 = 0, we get x * 0, which simplifies to 0.\n- Replace F with FJ, keeping in mind FJ(x,y) means x = y.\n\nApplying these replacements to the original formula \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\u2192F(x,y), we get:\n\n\u2200xFJ(gJ(x,0),x)\u2192FJ(x,y)\n\nSimplifying gJ(x,0) to 0, since multiplication with 0 yields 0, we further get:\n\n\u2200xFJ(0,x)\u2192FJ(x,y)\n\nGiven that FJ(x,y) means x = y, we can write this as:\n\n\u2200x(0 = x) \u2192 (x = y)\n\nHowever, we need to adjust this to fit the defined predicate FJ(x,y) directly, which means x = y. Thus, the correct interpretation, adhering strictly to FJ's definition, in the context of the logic rule and symbols provided, should be:\n\n\u2200xFJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y)\n\nThis formula reads as \"For all x, if the result of the function gJ applied to x and 0 equals x (which simplifies to if 0 equals x), then x equals y.\"\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under \ud835\udc3d, in the specified format, is:\n\n[[]]\n[\u2200x(FJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y))]\n\nPlease note the adjustment to directly use FJ as per its definition, reflecting the logical language \ud835\udc40's requirements."}

The statement is saying it is necessary that a person cannot both pull their own hair and leave the earth, which implies that it is impossible for a person to both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nThe inference made is that \"A person cannot possibly pull their own hair and leave the earth\", which can be symbolized as $!(!p + q). This is saying it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, which is equivalent to saying it is not possible for a person to both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nGiven the modal logic inference formulas, the most direct correspondence to this inference is:\n\n- #(!p + q) \u2192 $!(!p + q)\n\nThis can be paraphrased as: If it is necessary that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, then it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nTo find the exact formula that corresponds to this reasoning, we can look at the given formulas and identify which one aligns with the structure of our inference. The inference from #(!p + q) to $!(!p + q) involves necessity implying possibility, but in a slightly indirect manner since it involves the negation of a conjunction. The direct implication from necessity to possibility is given by formula (9):\n\n(9) #p \u2192 $p\n\nHowever, our inference involves the negation of a conjunction, !(p + q), so we need to adjust our interpretation. The inference from #!(p + q) to $!(!p + q) is essentially an application of the principle that necessity implies possibility (formula 9) in a context involving the negation of a proposition. Thus, we can infer $!(!p + q) from #!(!p + q) directly by applying the principle that necessity implies possibility to the negated conjunction, even though it's not explicitly listed in the provided formulas in the exact form we're using.\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the provided formulas and find the closest match that aligns with the essence of the inference without directly involving the conjunction, we look for a formula that reflects a necessary proposition implying a possible proposition. Formula (9) is the closest match, but it's not directly applicable to our compound proposition. Instead, we must infer that since #!(!p + q) implies a form of impossibility, its de Morgan's law equivalent, #(p + q), would imply a form of necessity that must also hold. Given #(p + q), we can infer $!(!p + q) using formula (9) indirectly, understanding that we're applying the necessity-to-possibility implication to the negation of the original compound proposition after a logical transformation.\n\nTherefore, the closest formula in spirit, while not a perfect match due to the complexity of the compound propositions involved, is:\n\n[[9]] #p \u2192 $p\n\nThis formula underscores the principle that necessity implies possibility, and when applied in a context where we're discussing the negation of a compound proposition, it supports the inference made. However, the direct formula for the inference from #!(!p + q) to $!(!p + q) is not explicitly listed, and the application involves a logical transformation step based on de Morgan's laws before applying the necessity-to-possibility implication, which is the essence captured by formula (9). Given the constraints and the request for a specific formula number, [[9]] is the most relevant, while noting that the actual inference involves an additional conceptual step."}

There is no connection between things.\nB. There might be a connection between things.\nC. There is a connection between things.\nD. It is impossible for things to be connected.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the truth modal reasoning formula 15, which states that `p \u2192 $p`, we can infer that if it is true that \"There is necessarily a connection between things\" (denoted by `#p`), then it is possible that \"There is a connection between things\" (denoted by `$p`).\n\nHowever, the formula provided (`p \u2192 $p`) directly implies that if a proposition is true, then it is possible. Since the given statement asserts the necessity (`#p`) rather than the truth (`p`) of the proposition, we need to adapt our reasoning to include the modal aspect. According to the inference formulas provided, we have `#p \u2192 $p` (formula 9), which directly supports the inference from necessity to possibility.\n\nThus, from \"There is necessarily a connection between things\" (#p), we can infer \"There might be a connection between things\" ($p).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]\n\nB. There might be a connection between things."}

However, since we are asked to relate it based on the provided logic and forced to fit it within the given framework, we might interpret this as an action that could occur in the future, tentatively represented as `Fp` (future point in time, positive statement about contract execution), assuming the sentence is implying a future permission or intention.\n\nGiven the (somewhat forced) interpretations of `H\u00acp` (Aunt Wang never won awards in the past) and `Fp` (allowing contract execution in the future), these do not directly fit any of the defined relationship pairs (Ap and Hp, A\u00acp and H\u00acp; Gp and Fp, G\u00acp and F\u00acp) for the `\u2042 Relationship`. However, since the question compels us to classify it within the given relationships, and there's no direct temporal relationship between the past and the future in this manner in the provided logic, the closest relationship that can be inferred, given the constraints, would be the independence of these statements from each other in the context of the defined relationships. They are effectively unrelated in the temporal logic frame provided. Since the `\u21a6 Relationship` allows for two statements to both be false (which these could be, given their separate timelines and subjects), this might be the least incorrect categorization, even if it's a stretch due to the unrelated nature of the statements.\n\nThus, for the second pair, the relationship is somewhat of a misfit, but if classified under the given schema, it could tentatively be considered a `B. \u21a6 Relationship` based on the lack of direct temporal connection and the ability for both statements to simultaneously be true or false in their respective contexts, despite the logic not strictly applying due to the unrelated contents of the statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n`[[C];[B]]`\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the second classification is a significant stretch due to the unrelated nature of the statements to the defined temporal logic framework. A more accurate interpretation might be that the second pair does not fit any of the provided relationships under the strict application of the defined logic. If the question mandates a choice within the given options, the answer is provided above. If there's flexibility to acknowledge the mismatch, the second pair should be recognized as not fitting the defined relationships properly."}

This formula indeed captures the essence of the inference from a negated past period of time to a negated past point in time.\n\nConversely, the inference from \"Old Zhao did not work in Ningbo at some point in the past\" (\\( \\neg Hp \\)) to \"It is not the case that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past\" (\\( \\neg Ap \\)) can be made using formula 4, \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\), in conjunction with formula 7, \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\). This is because \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) leads to \\( H\u00acp \\), and then \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\) leads to \\( \\neg Ap \\).\n\nTherefore, there are two reasoning formulas directly involved in this inference process: formula 4 and formula 11.\n\nThe answer, in the requested format, is:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nHowever, if we count the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) (formula 7) as necessary for the second inference, then we would have three formulas involved:\n```\n[[3]]\n```\n\nGiven the specific phrasing of the question and the directness of the inference paths, the most appropriate answer, considering the direct formulas for the given question's phrasing, would be:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nThis interpretation emphasizes the direct inference between negated propositions without relying on the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) as an additional formula for the count, since formula 4 directly implies the inference of negated continuous action from a negated point in time, and formula 11 directly implies the reverse."}

However, since neither `c1` nor `c2` affect `\u03c6`, it implies that the possibility of `\u03c6` being true after executing each command independently is not influenced by the commands.

To express the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` without affecting `\u03c6` in this format, considering the rule's context and the given condition, we interpret the request as needing to express the necessity aspect of the concurrent execution, acknowledging that the concurrent execution does not change the truth value of `\u03c6` (since neither command affects it), thus not altering the necessity of `\u03c6`. Given this interpretation, we express the necessity of `\u03c6` being unchanged by the concurrent execution as follows:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ]\u03c6 ]`\n\nBut since `\u03c6` is unaffected, this is equivalent to asserting the necessity of `\u03c6` itself, leading to:\n\n`[ \u03c6 ]`\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the format `[[]]` and express concurrent execution without implying a direct implication on `\u03c6` (since the question specifies that the commands do not affect `\u03c6`), we can represent the concurrent execution without directly involving `\u03c6` in the inner brackets:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ] ]\u03c6`\n\nThis format captures the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` and then asserts `\u03c6`, reflecting that `\u03c6`'s truth value is independent of this concurrent execution. Given the specifics, this is a contextual interpretation that acknowledges the commands' irrelevance to `\u03c6`'s truth value while adhering to the `[[]]` format.\n\nThus, the final expression reflecting the question's conditions and the requested format is:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ] ]\u03c6`\n\nThis expression, in its simplest form, acknowledges the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` and then asserts `\u03c6`, consistent with the given condition that `\u03c6` is unaffected."}

Although the question asks for the proportion in a [[number%]] format, traditionally U-Generalization does not provide a probabilistic proportion but rather suggests that the entire population shares the observed characteristic. However, to adhere strictly to the requested format and considering the logical leap necessary from U-Generalization to a probabilistic interpretation in this context, one could state:\n\nSince all observed individuals in the sample possess the attribute of good health, the U-Generalization rule implies that 100% of the population may share this attribute.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[100%]]\n\nThis interpretation stretches the U-Generalization rule to fit a probabilistic format, understanding that U-Generalization itself does not inherently deal in probabilities but rather suggests a universal application of an observed trait to the entire population."}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a library's annual report, 1,000 loans are recorded, of which 200 are for science fiction books.\nPlease represent this symbolically according to the P-Generalization rule .\n\nDenote the attribute science fiction books borrowed as A.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the scenario and following the P-Generalization rule, we have:\n\n- `A` represents the attribute of being a science fiction book borrowed.\n- `k` represents the number of individuals in the sample with the attribute `A`, which is 200 in this case.\n- `n` represents the total number of individuals in the sample, which is 1,000 in this case.\n\nApplying the P-Generalization Rule, we infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`. Thus, the proportion of science fiction books borrowed in the population can be inferred to be approximately `200/1000`.\n\nSymbolically, according to the rule:\n- If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\nTherefore, for this scenario, the symbolic representation is:\n- `P(A, 200, 1000)` implies `Pr(A) \u2248 200/1000`.\n\nThe whole can be symbolized as follows, adhering to the requested format:\n\n`[P(A, 200, 1000)]`\n\nThis representation signifies that, based on the sample data, there is an inference that the proportion of science fiction books borrowed in the entire population of book loans from the library is approximately `200/1000`, or in simplified terms, 1/5.

However, according to the equivalence condition, the universal hypothesis is equivalent to its contrapositive, \"All non-white things are not swans\" (\u2200x(\u00acW(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x))), which means observing a non-swan that is non-white (\u00acS(b)\u2227\u00acW(b)) also confirms the original hypothesis.

The statement \"Some soccer players are on the field\" (B) is weaker than \"All soccer players are on the field\" (A), and A entails B (since if all players are on the field, it is necessarily true that some players are on the field). By choosing to use the weaker statement without asserting the stronger one, the speaker signals to the hearer that they do not have enough information to assert the stronger statement, or that the stronger statement is not true (K~(A(s)) in the rule's notation).\n\nThe C% Principle's Speaker's Criterion states that one should speak as little as possible, but the context here involves choosing between statements of different strengths to convey the level of certainty or knowledge about the situation, which is more aligned with the C* Principle.\n\nThe C! Principle is not applicable in this scenario, as it concerns avoiding lengthy or marked expressions when simpler ones suffice, which is not the case here since the difference between \"all\" and \"some\" is not about the length or complexity of the expression but about the information strength."}

C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm \u2192 Beer is part of the food in the food box\" is most closely aligned with the C% Principle.\n\n1. **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalization and the speaker speaking as little as possible. The inference here is that when Xiao Ma mentions the beer being warm upon opening the food box, it suggests that the beer is an unexpected item that stands out because it's not in its expected state (usually cold). Given the context of opening a food box, the minimal information provided implies that the beer is part of the contents of the food box, as it is the simplest and most direct explanation for this observation. This adheres to CI2 of the C% Principle, where the hearer expands the information to grasp the intention of the speech, assuming that the mentioned \"beer is still warm\" is an unusual fact that stands out and is meant to be understood as part of the described situation without further embellishment.\n\n2. The statement does not seem to invoke the **C* Principle**, as it's not about the speaker avoiding making a stronger statement due to lack of knowledge or intentionally not providing more precise information. The focus is not on the contrast between possible stronger and weaker statements or inferences about the speaker's knowledge limitations.\n\n3. Regarding the **C! Principle**, the statement does not utilize a lengthy, obscure, or marked expression that could suggest a deviation from conventional meanings or the need to avoid conventional associations. The phrasing is straightforward, and the inference does not require avoiding or reinterpreting conventional meanings in a significant way as per the C! Principle.\n\nThus, based on the principles and the statement provided, the most fitting principle is the C% Principle."}

C's choice to use \"managed to get\" instead of a simpler, more direct phrase like B's \"borrowed\" is significant.\n\nC's response, \"I managed to get the materials,\" employs a marked expression that signals something beyond the mere fact of having successfully borrowed the materials. By choosing this marked expression, C is conveying additional information about the process or effort involved. This aligns with the C!
