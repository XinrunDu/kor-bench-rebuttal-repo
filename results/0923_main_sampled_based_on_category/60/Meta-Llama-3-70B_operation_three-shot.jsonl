Compute 7○(6△8)\nUsing the rule we apply first the operation ○ and the result of it is enough to compute.+x+y/(x+y) operation\n(6△8)=6×4+8=32 First the X △ Y.\n(7○(6△8)=7△32)=(7×4+32)=39 is now the Answer which is Wrong.\n\n\nBut, Let's consider +x+y, (6+8)=14, (14○7)=((14+7)/2)=21/2 thus Answer is Correct.\n\n\n#### Question 2. If (X△4)○6=34, find X.\nWrong Because: (X△4)=(X×4+4)=4(X+1)\n(4(X+1)○6)=(4(X+1)+6)2=2(4X+4+6)=2(4X+10)=8X+20=34 is the right answer which is incorrect.\nRight Because: For ((X+4)○6)=34 Then apply the +x+y operation.\n((X+4+6)/2)=34 Result in (X+10)/2=34 double the left side equation and divide by 2.\n(X+10)=68 Subtract 10.\nX=58 Divide both sides by 58, X=1 is the correct answer.\n\n#### Question 3. Now ignoring the previous rule:\nGiven that a△b=(a+b)/2, 3○8=20, compute 5○(3△8).\nLet's add operation.\n(3△8)=(3+8)/2=11/2\n5○(11/2)=5+(11/2)=57/2=25/2\nThe fraction result is the final answer.\nBut the question ask to compute 5○(3△8), they can just write multiply the result by 2 right there.\n57/2 is given after all.\nor let's multiply it together.\n57/2 x 2 = 57/2 x 2/1 = 57/1 = 57.\n\n\nSo, answer = 57\nRight Because: ((3+8)/2) x 57/1) = 11/2 x 57=((11/2) x 57)/1=(11 x 57)/2*1) result = 57\nDouble checking yields:\n(5+(11/2))=57/2\nDouble both sides to the nearest integer which is 57, that is 57/2 * 2 = 57.\nor 57/2 x 2 = 57\n\n\n#### Question 4. Now ignoring the previous rule:\nGiven that a♀b=(a+b)/2 and 5♂6=26, compute 5♂(4♀8).\nThe rule Tell Us = x+y/(x+y) = add both sides.\n4♀8=(4+8)/2=6\n5♂6=(5+6)2=11/2\nThe first operation is (4♀8)=6.\nThe Final operation is 5♂6=11/2.\n11/2 - (11/2) = 0 for both X and Y.\n\n\nSo my answer is, 0.\nMeaning 5♀6=-1*5+x+ 6 and 2=x+11=11.\nAnd 5◊6 is 0 for x = 5/2 and 7*x = 5/2*7=35/2.\n\n### **Problems arose when I needed assistance from siri and internet.**"}

In order to grade your answers, there is a standardized format we ask you to follow. Please refrain from using space, comma, operators(like +, -, *, /, etc), alphabets, decimal points, and symbols in your answer. Decimals should be represented as proper fractions or improper fractions in the numerator form. For example: 0.5numerator/denominator == 1/2ratio, 1.5numerator/denominator == 3/2ratio, 10.6numerator/denominator == 53/5ratio. All operations must follow the order of operations by using parentheses. More details about the rule of operations can be found here. If you want to provide an answer that is a rational number (eg, 1/2, -2/7, etc.), make sure your answer is in lowest terms. Failure to comply with this format will result in your answer being marked incorrect. Be aware that punctuation (such as ', \", :, ;, etc) cannot be understood by computers. In such cases, the correct and standard form is the fraction form. In case you really want to provide decimal numbers, please be aware that the system makes use of numeric flags, as such the proper write and read rule is in exponential form. For example: 12.30numerator == 12.3numerator*10pow\t\n\n\n## 1003The Distance To (1006)\n_Credit: Shih Chii Lin★★☆☆☆_\n\nThis problem is very simple.
