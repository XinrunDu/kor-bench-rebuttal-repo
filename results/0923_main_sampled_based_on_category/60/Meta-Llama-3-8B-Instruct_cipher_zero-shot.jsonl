Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Since the plaintext has only one character, I'll process it as a single block.\n\n- For blocks of 1 character:\n    - The grid index is calculated as: (0 // 5) % 8 = 0 (since 0/5 is 0 and 0%8 is 0)\n    - In Grid0, the position of \"V\" is found, which is (18, 5).\n\n- Now, to encrypt the character \"V\", I'll move one grid position to the lower right:\n\n    | P | H | I | L | S |\n    | A | B | C | D | E |\n    | F | G | K | M | N |\n    | O | Q | R | T | U |\n    | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n    After moving one grid position to the lower right, I get:\n\n    | O | Q | R | T | U |\n    | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n    | P | H | I | L | S |\n    | A | B | C | D | E |\n    | F | G | K | M | N |\n\n    The new position of \"V\" is (19, 6).\n\n- The encrypted letter is Added to the encrypted block, which is just a single character in this case.\n\n- The final encrypted message is: [V] = [[W]]\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[W]]"}

Initially select the Reel1.\n2. For each character \"F\" in the plaintext:\n\t* Find character \"F\" on Reel1: it's at index 6, so the next character on Reel1 is \"A\" (index 7). Reel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n\t* Replace \"F\" with \"A\".\n3. For each character \"V\" in the plaintext:\n\t* Find character \"V\" on Reel1: it's at index 15, so the next character on Reel1 is \"H\" (index 16). Reel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n\t* Replace \"V\" with \"H\".\n4. For each character \"M\" in the plaintext:\n\t* Find character \"M\" on Reel1: it's at index 11, so the next character on Reel1 is \"T\" (index 12).

Reel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n\t* Replace \"L\" with \"Q\".\n7. For each character \"X\" in the plaintext:\n\t* Find character \"X\" on Reel1: it's at index 23, so the next character on Reel1 is \"Z\" (index 24). Reel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n\t* Replace \"X\" with \"Z\".\n8. For each character \"T\" in the plaintext:\n\t* Find character \"T\" on Reel1: it's at index 12, so the next character on Reel1 is \"K\" (index 13). Reel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n\t* Replace \"T\" with \"K\".\n9.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Preparation: Use the same key as for encryption, which is the SHA-256 hash value of \"SECRET_KEY\", i.e., '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n2. Converting the ciphertext to a sequence of bytes:\n   Since the ciphertext is a hexadecimal string, it is converted to bytes in the order bytes = [int(ciphertext[i*2:i*2+2], 16) for i in range(len(ciphertext)//2)]\n   bytes: [37, 117, 219, 52, 39, 120, 34, 39, 117, 190, 186, 11]\n\n3. Decrypting each byte using the XOR operation with the corresponding key byte:\n   Since the length of the key is shorter than the length of the ciphertext, we recursively cycle through the key.\n   decrypted_bytes = [b^k for b, k in zip(bytes, iter(key))]\n\n   where the iteration over the key is implemented using the iter function, ensuring the key is cycled through correctly.\n\n   decrypted_bytes: [23, 96, 32, 103, 36, 111, 75, 39, 117, 76, 142, 140]\n\n4. Converting the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string:\n   The byte sequence represents ASCII values. Converting these to uppercase letters gives the decrypted plaintext.\n   decrypted_plaintext: 'MSGREETING'\n\nThe decrypted answer is: [[MSGREETING]]."}
