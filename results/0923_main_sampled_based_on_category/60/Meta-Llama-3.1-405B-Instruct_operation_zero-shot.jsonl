Since 286 is indeed a multiple of 13 (286 = 13 * 22), we will use the rule a※b = a/b + 2. Therefore, 286※13 = 286/13 + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the operation 19※28\nNext, we need to determine if 19 is a multiple of 28 or if 28 is a multiple of 19. Since neither 19 is a multiple of 28 nor 28 is a multiple of 19, we will use the rule a※b = 24.

According to the rule, when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24. Therefore, 19※28 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate 24※4\nSince 24 is a multiple of 4 (24 = 6 * 4), we apply the rule a※b = a/b + 2.

However, we need to correct this step based on the proper evaluation of the previous operations: The correct sequence should continue from the result of 19※28, which was correctly identified as 24, and then the operation 24※4 was also correctly identified as 8. Then, we actually need to evaluate the full sequence correctly:\n\n- We've correctly determined 104※13 = 10.\n- Then, we need to evaluate 19※28 correctly as 24.\n- Next, the operation 24※4 was correctly identified as 8.\n- However, the mistake was in not following the given operation sequence correctly in the explanation: After correctly finding 19※28 = 24 and then 24※4 = 8, we need to apply the operation 8※10.\n\nGiven 8 is not a multiple of 10 and 10 is not a multiple of 8, according to the rule, 8※10 should indeed equal 24.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the Evaluation Sequence and Final Answer\nThe correct sequence should be:\n1. 104※13 = 10\n2. 19※28 = 24 (because they are not multiples of each other)\n3. 24※4 = 8 (correctly applied)\n4. Finally, the operation should be 8※10, but we previously determined the need to evaluate 8※10 which we stated would equal 24 but missed the sequence correctly in explanation. The actual operation we should focus on, given the sequence and correcting for clarity is realizing we mistakenly jumped to an evaluation without addressing the sequence properly in explanation.\n\nGiven the proper sequence and acknowledging the oversight in explanation but not in calculation, let's clarify the final step based on the rules provided without adding confusion:\n\n- Correctly we have 8 from the operation before the last step.\n- We should then calculate the final operation as presented originally but ensuring clarity: The operation 8※10 or any operation following the sequence should adhere strictly to the given rules.\n\nHowever, the final operation in the sequence provided (Step 4) was misstated in the explanation process but not in calculation: It's about understanding the correct sequence was evaluated but not properly detailed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"}

Let's correct the approach by directly solving for X○3 first and then applying it to 5○(result).\n\n## Step 10: Correctly apply the operation to find X\nGiven the misstep in algebraic manipulation and the need for an integer solution, let's reconsider the direct application of the operation to find a suitable integer value for X that satisfies the given equation, possibly simplifying the operation's result to directly find X.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the operation for X○3 with correct application\nWe should directly calculate X○3 and apply it in the context of the given equation to solve for X correctly, considering integer values that make the equation true.\n\n## Step 12: Correct calculation and solving for X\nThe mistake in algebraic steps indicates a recalibration towards directly applying the operation's rule and solving for X through a more straightforward method, especially focusing on the initial operation X○3 and its direct implications on solving the equation.\n\n## Step 13: Solve with correct application of the operation\nSince the steps deviated from directly solving the equation based on the operation's rule, let's refocus on applying the rule to find X, considering that the result of the operation should lead us directly to the value of X that satisfies the equation 5○(X○3)=63.\n\n## Step 14: Final calculation step\nGiven the operation and the necessity to correct and simplify our approach, the key lies in directly and correctly applying the operation's rule to the given values, ensuring we solve for X in a manner that adheres to the operation's definition and the equation provided.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"}

We are given two equations based on this rule: 7 ○ 2 = 208 and 2 ○ 3 = 77.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Rule to the First Equation\nFor the first equation, 7 ○ 2 = 208, we substitute A = 7 and B = 2 into the rule to get (7 + 3*2) × (x*7 + y*2) = 208. This simplifies to (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208, which further simplifies to 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the First Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 13 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 7x + 2y = 208 / 13, which simplifies to 7x + 2y = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Second Equation\nFor the second equation, 2 ○ 3 = 77, we substitute A = 2 and B = 3 into the rule to get (2 + 3*3) × (x*2 + y*3) = 77. This simplifies to (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77, which further simplifies to 11 × (2x + 3y) = 77.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the Second Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 11 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 2x + 3y = 77 / 11, which simplifies to 2x + 3y = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the System of Equations\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) 7x + 2y = 16\n2) 2x + 3y = 7\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the second equation by 2 and the first equation by 3, we can eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal but opposite in sign.\n\n## Step 7: Eliminate y\nMultiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 4x + 6y = 14. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us 21x + 6y = 48. Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives us (21x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 48 - 14, which simplifies to 17x = 34.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of 17x = 34 by 17 gives us x = 2.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for y\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Using 2x + 3y = 7 and substituting x = 2 gives us 2*2 + 3y = 7, which simplifies to 4 + 3y = 7. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3y = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us y = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: [[x=2,y=1]]"}

Therefore, we focus on the even numbers that could be in the range.\n\nSince the average is 6, and considering even numbers, the closest scenario that could give us an average of 6 without going below it (since we're considering X as a variable starting point) is having the numbers 6 and another even number that also averages to 6 when combined with 6.

According to the rule for operation ①, this translates to \\sqrt{6}+(\\sqrt{X}×4)^2.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation \\sqrt{6}+(\\sqrt{X}×4)^2=40. The term (\\sqrt{X}×4)^2 can be further simplified to 16X.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for X\nNow the equation becomes \\sqrt{6}+16X=40. To solve for X, we need to isolate X. Subtract \\sqrt{6} from both sides of the equation to get 16X=40-\\sqrt{6}.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the equation to find X\nDivide both sides of the equation by 16 to solve for X: X=(40-\\sqrt{6})/16.\n\n## Step 7: Write the final answer in the required format\nThe final answer needs to be in LaTeX format. If the answer is a fraction, it should be written as \\frac{a}{b}. Since the answer contains a root sign, it should be written as \\sqrt{x} where x is the number under the root.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{40-\\sqrt{6}}{16}}$"}

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4.

This means that when any two positive integers a and b are \"operated on\" by ￠, we need to calculate the logarithm of a with base b plus the logarithm of b with base a.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given operation rule to the problem\nGiven that X￠256=73/24, we need to apply the operation rule to solve for X. This translates to \\log_{256}{X} + \\log_{X}{256} = 73/24.\n\n## Step 3: Utilize logarithmic properties to simplify the equation\nWe can simplify the equation by recalling that \\log_{a}{b} = 1/\\log_{b}{a}. Thus, the equation can be rewritten as \\log_{256}{X} + 1/\\log_{256}{X} = 73/24.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for \\log_{256}{X}\nLet's denote \\log_{256}{X} as y for simplification. Then the equation becomes y + 1/y = 73/24. Multiply through by y to get y^2 - (73/24)y + 1 = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the quadratic formula to solve for y\nThe quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions for x are given by x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In our case, a = 1, b = -(73/24), and c = 1.\n\n## Step 6: Plug the values into the quadratic formula\ny = [73/24 ± sqrt((-73/24)^2 - 4*1*1)] / (2*1).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation under the square root\ny = [73/24 ± sqrt(5329/576 - 4)] / 2.\n\n## Step 8: Continue simplifying\ny = [73/24 ± sqrt(5329/576 - 2304/576)] / 2.\n\n## Step 9: Further simplification\ny = [73/24 ± sqrt(3025/576)] / 2.\n\n## Step 10: Solve the square root\ny = [73/24 ± 55/24] / 2.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for y\nWe have two possible values for y: y = (73/24 + 55/24) / 2 and y = (73/24 - 55/24) / 2.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the first value for y\ny1 = (128/24) / 2 = 64/24 = 8/3.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the second value for y\ny2 = (18/24) / 2 = 9/24 = 3/8.\n\n## Step 14: Interpret y values as logarithms to solve for X\nGiven that y = \\log_{256}{X}, we can now solve for X by considering both y values.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for X using the first y value\nFor y1 = 8/3, X = 256^(8/3).\n\n## Step 16: Solve for X using the second y value\nFor y2 = 3/8, X = 256^(3/8).\n\n## Step 17: Calculate X for both values\nSince 256 is 2^8, we can simplify X for both values: X1 = (2^8)^(8/3) and X2 = (2^8)^(3/8).\n\n## Step 18: Simplify X calculations\nX1 = 2^(64/3) and X2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\n## Step 19: Determine the viable solution\nGiven that X must be a positive integer and considering the results, X2 = 8 is the viable solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"}

Since f(x) = x^(1/2), the derivative f'(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2) = 1/(2√x).\n\n## Step 3: Find the derivative of g(x) = cos(x)\nThe derivative of g(x) = cos(x) is g'(x) = -sin(x), which is a basic trigonometric derivative.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the operation rule f□g = f'(x) + g'(x)\nNow that we have found the derivatives of f(x) and g(x), we can apply the operation rule to find f□g. So, f□g = 1/(2√x) - sin(x).\n\n## Step 5: Format the final answer in LaTeX\nTo provide the answer in LaTeX format as requested, we write the final expression as \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} - \\sin(x).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} - \\sin(x)}$"}

This gives us \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx=b.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the integral equation.\nThe integral of 2x from 0 to b is x^2 from 0 to b, which equals b^2 - 0^2 = b^2.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the result of the integral to b and solve for b.\nWe now have b^2 = b. To solve for b, we can rearrange this equation as b^2 - b = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the quadratic equation to find the values of b.\nFactoring the quadratic equation b^2 - b = 0 gives us b(b - 1) = 0. This means b = 0 or b - 1 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for the values of b.\nSolving b = 0 or b - 1 = 0 gives us b = 0 or b = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0or1}$"}
