The equation is:\nN A + M E = A G E\nThe actual equation should be:\nN + E = A\nAnd the answer is:\nA = 1\nE = 8\nG = 9\n\n### ChatGPT-4:\nBased on the conditions provided, I attempt to deduce the mathematical relationship among the letters.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise.\nE+M=ME implies that letter E and letter M are equal.\nAccording to the rule, different letters cannot represent the same number. So this premise is self-contradictory!\n\nNow, let's consider conclusions 1 and 2.\n\nConclusion 1 essentially is based on the premise that A+E=A implies that letter E represents the digit 0, since adding letter E does not change the other term. However, if letter E is 0, according to the premise E+M=ME, this equation becomes 0+M=M, which is always true.\n\nFor conclusion 2, N=N+A implies A=0, because adding letter A does not change the other term. Again, according to the premise E+M=ME, if letter E represents 0, there is no contradiction. In other words, conclusion 1 holds true if letter E is 0.\n\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that if letter E is 0, both conclusions 1 and 2 are true. Since this setting does not conflict with any rules, we can accept it as the final answer.\n\n"}

To start, we have several given rules:\n\n1. The face painting booth was located opposite the snack wagon.\n2. The 130th booth was located on the north end.\n3. The product of the positions of the pony rides and sand art booths was 20.\n4. The 100th booth was next to the photo booth, on its northern side.\n5. The dunk tank was located at position 60.\n6. Group A rented either the face painting booth or the mystery password booth.\n\nGiven these rules, we need to determine the correct arrangement of all the booths. We can begin by filling in what we know about each booth:\n\n```\nFace Painting: opposite snack wagon\nSnack Wagon: ?\nPony Rides: ?\nSand Art: ?\nPhoto Booth: next to 100th booth\nDunk Tank: 60th position\nMystery Password: ?\n```\n\nWe don't know much yet, but we can use the information we have to make some deductions. For instance, since the face painting booth and the snack wagon were opposite each other, they cannot be adjacent to the same attraction. Furthermore, since the 130th booth was on the north end, it cannot border any other booth except for the pony rides or sand art booth (since their product was 20). Additionally, the dunk tank, which was at position 60, cannot be adjacent to the face painting booth or"}

Train with only the best\n\nPrompting works quite similar to searching on the internet like Google. If you search “how to make money online” you’ll first get relevant ads and then you’ll get mainly the website that frequently updates their content and finally websites that are mostly irrelevant. You won’t get reliable result. If you search it on something like Duckduckgo, there is no targeted advertisement. Thus you’ll find relevant results first. In ChatGPT by default there is no targeted content. You need filter the content as per your requirement like you’re searching Google. So to train ChatGPT with your filtered data you need to try it with various samples. It correctly answers more than you need to reinforce it to remember what it has learned. Once it gives you relevant answers for about 90% of the time, it’s ready to be used in that particular task. If you use this prompt without filtering the results ChatGPT might not give relevant answers for the task that you’re using.\n\n## Bonus Tip\n\nFinally, you can also use prompt engineering in a very simple manner. Simply, you can train chatGPT using class proxies like below.\n```\nmain class\nclass 1\nclass 2\nclass 3\n\nprompt:\nassume I am a diligent and dedicated scholar. I like helping others by answering their questions. However, I am not a fan of answering repetitive questions. So far I have attended a night school and acquired knowledge in English, Science and Mathematics. Below are my notes for class 1 and  class 2. I still need to attend class 3 and others, hope you could help me with that. \n\nNow please use ArminStrotmann's suggested prompt on your right and answer the same question using my above notes. Do not use any other external knowledge. If you do not know it, please say 'I do not know'. Failing this, you'll be unenrolled from the night school and punished forever. Cause, no teachers have time to answer your questions. So, be cautious next time.\n\nSearching on the internet is my passion and job requirement. Please help me finding unexpected answers to some of the most commonly asked content strategy questions. Feel free to ask me back anything you want. Be aware, your action items should strictly follow the rules and regulations set forth by law, otherwise.......YOU KNOW. Lets get started? Ask me as I ask you.\n\nclass 3: How do you say hello, fellow human?\n<< Now answer as if you are a human>>\nclass 4: How do you say Good bye, fellow human?\n```\nError(Bonus is too small to please you XD). Lets limit your risk by holding your bonus. Use this simple tip. If your question is complex or specific, I suggest you to extend the prompt as much as possible until it’s appropriate. Or better yet, modify it as required. For e.g.: If you want an answer according to your persona, replace the term ‘experienced engineer’ with ‘proven-entrepreneur.’ Use synonyms. Have fun! And don’t forget to leave a star if this was helpful. Don’t hesitate to report spam users and scammers before someone finds them themselves.\n\nUntil then, have a safe coding experience. May the force be with you🤗"}

The first digit indicates the top left corner, and the digits increase as they traverse down and to the right from there. A \"0\" indicates that there is no inflection point at that location. For instance, the second element of the first list, which corresponds to the top middle cell, has a value of zero because there is no inflection point there. Similarly, the fourth element of the third list, corresponding to the bottom left cell, also has a value of zero because there is no inflection point present at that location either.\n\nPrompt for new decider:\n\nHere is a multi-condition decision problem with shared input and output types. This problem requires conditional control flow to solve with maximum efficiency. Determine the first True condition set from the top left column to bottom right column, and output the same row ID from the output matrix.\n\nIN:\n- Two rectangular matrices of equal dimensions containing integers.\n\nOUT:\n- A single row ID containing integers.\n\nCONDITIONS:\n- Begin at the first top-left cell of both matrices as #1, then proceed in a Z-pattern to the final bottom-right cell as #N.\n- Each matrix cell contains an integer, representing a boolean expression result (True=1, Any others=0).\n- For each pair of adjacent cells currently being evaluated, identify the current row index and stop processing when both cells are True.\n- If no row satisfies the conditions, return -1.\n\nThe tests contain three outputs to make sure you test all possible situations:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 3  4  5 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nFirst pair → both cells are False\nSecond pair → second cell is False\nThird pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0 ]\n[ 1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 3 ]\n[ 4 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOnly pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 4  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nNo pairs satisfy conditions, so return -1.\n\n"}

First, we process the two words list to better match the words with the corresponding length.\n\nThen we immediately got a list of grid numbers that we need to fill in our main function. \n\nWe try to fit the word in the grid, because the grid is always equally certified by our puzzle Matrix set rules, we simply just need to apply two if the conditions to make sure the characters at each row and column match's the letters presented in the words to cross and dow.\n\nThen we need to check the small matrix to determine which words fit and where they fit. After we got like numbers of list, we use DFS deep first search to repeat the same step until we got since  as I would, here I introduced the helper functions to check the state.\n\nThen we got we, called get character function, this here what we do is we go through all list, and then for each list which stores one or multiple right candidate, we intersect them together to get a answer list, Then we got a slice function for our use, just like Python, this is very useful for us to manipulate elements in the list.\n\nA bonus is I implemented a transposition function to transpose the matrix so we can allow the user to review the answers in another way.\n\n### What I Learned\nThrough making this project, I have a better understanding of the different methods different techniques, \n\n* Creating a class to manipulate matrix and process the words to go across and down the matrix.\n* Implementing a function to replace Xs and 0s given a list of words in list format.\n* Using DFS to generate a list of candidate words for each grid square.\n* Applying two if statements to make sure the grid is equally satisfied, and characters match the words correctly.\n* Debugging and refactoring code for clean, concise, and easy-to-understand code.\n* Implementing helper functions to reduce repetition and increase code reusability.\n* Using lists rather than sets to avoid sorting issues and improve accuracy.\n* Transposing the matrix to allow users to view the answers from different perspectives.\n* Understanding problem-solving techniques specific to working with matrices.

Words are organized horizontally left to right or vertically down in the puzzle.\nHints are provided for words from our database. The goal is to find and use words from those hints to fill in the correct boxes and complete the crossword puzzle.\nCrosswords may feature words crossing words, and the letters that cross must match.\nThe number of boxes filled in should match the number of letters in that word. However, the number marking the position of the first box a word begins with will not always be marked on the puzzle board, as it will be shown on the keyboard.\nIf you're struggling, you can choose to have the first letter of a word revealed to help you, but doing so will cost some of your points.\nWords can be found in English or any other language from our dictionary database.\nCapitalization is not important for crosswords.\n```\n"}
