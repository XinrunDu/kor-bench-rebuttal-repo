To calculate 7♀3, we add 7+3=10 and then divide it by 2, resulting in 7♀3=5.\n\n### In the new rule, what does 3♀8 equal?\nUsing the rule for a♀b=(a+b)/2, we compute 3♀8 as follows:\n3♀8 = (3+8)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5, rounded to one decimal place.\n\n### How can I apply the custom operations accurately?\nJust follow each rule and calculate according to the given symbols. For example, if the question asks to calculate 5△9, and the rule is a△b=(a+b)/2, replace a by 5 and b by 9, and follow the rule by doing (5+9)/2.\n\n### What is the rule for the custom operation a♂b in the new rule when given that a▲b=(3×b)+10?\nThe rule for a♂b in the new rule is a×4+b. To calculate 5♂11, we multiply 5×4=20 and then add 11, resulting in 5♂11=31.\n\n### For a custom operation a△b where a△b=(a+b)/2, if (X△4)○6=34, what is X?\nStart by solving what X△4 equals:(X+4)/2=...$x + 4/2 = \\dots olab x+4=2\\dots lab x=\\doubut \\dots-4 lab x=...-4 lab x=12 labBased on this, X♂12 can then be solved using the operation rule (a×4+b), which should give you the final answer.Answer validation:20\n\n## FAQ (continued)\n\n### What are the rules for a△b (in the new rule) and a○b (in the new rule)?\nThe rule for a△b in the new rule is (a+b)/2. The rule for a○b in the new rule is a×4+b. For example, if a=5 and b=20, a♂b=(a+b)/2, which is (5+20)/2, giving 12.5.\n\n### How do I compute 7△6 when given that a△b=(a+b)/2?\nRefer to the rule to compute 7△6:\n7△6 = (7+6)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5.\n\n### What are some examples of operations with these custom rules after ignoring the previous rule?\nFor a△b=(a+b)/2, some examples could be: 3♂1=(3+1)/2=2, 8♀6=(8+6)/2=7.\n\n### What are the steps to calculate 5△(3♀8) according to the rule a△b=(a+b)/2?\nFirst, evaluate the operations within parantheses, following the given rules. There are no operations within parantheses. Next, apply the operation a△b=(a+b)/2 to the result. Therefore, 5△(3♀8)=(8/2)+(3♀8)=4+(3♀8)=4+7=11.\n\n### How do I correctly apply the operations for a♀b and a△b?\nYou should follow the given rules and do the math accordingly. For instance, if we have to calculate 3△(8♀6), we first start by doing 8♀6=14/2=7. Then, we take that result and put it into 3△7, giving us (3+7)/2=5.\n"}

Only state whether the proposition is true or false and explain why.\n\n### Answer:\nFalse.\na◇b= a^b. Given that both a and b are even, a^b can result in an even or odd number depending upon the values of a and b.\nCounter Example:\nLet a=4 and b=6.
