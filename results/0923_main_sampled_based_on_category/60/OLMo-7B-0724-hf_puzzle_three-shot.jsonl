Welcome to our intimate learning community, where leading education, finance, healthcare & other ninja/guru's come to grow their skills., We specialize in the creation of content and puzzles for corporate learners, students and puzzle enthusiasts. Please ask question(s) to our contributors/assignees through the help channel . ## Hi There Mr./Mrs. Puzzle Expert !! ## Here you can join other knowledgeable youngsters and secret gurus in building the puzzles for a fast and fluid educational experience. The majority of experts (the combined total of our youth) here in Puzzle Studio, has master level knowledge that they will attempt to disclose throughout our community. The social environment is just that. A place where youngsters make new friends, celebrate others talents and successes. They discover their talents within others and in turn tune-up their own. They learn from the challenges/openings presented on questions and develop helpers who discover great solutions. It is time to step back and let the youth shine as brilliant leaders and innovators in the context of your everyday business activities and operations. Thus, we have introduced the Yunggsters! A group of committed youngsters who's focus is on providing renewed quality content for enterprises that are in the 24/7 marketplace ,especially in the education field, where fast and fluid puzzle evolution is crucial. Already we have reached Fortarolla (Eastern California) and Cornicopia (Northern Italy) to establish coordinates of Pointy Mycusi for our team, who are in the process of drawing numbers for our marathon run this weekend. In house, an internal test of 13 is being conducted to fit out the possible solutions to the puzzle created, see a PM from Paul55 and in support to begin preparation of the Northern Europe air route, see the Cartes Janus. Please take note that a provide Live chess and See gauge which is still a day before our live game. We look forward to your response and enjoy! ## The Problem We have two sets of numbers, one denoted A and the other B. We perform the following operation to each of the A set numbers. For each number $i$ in $A, j$ in $B$: $n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))$ where $a_i$ and $a_i$ represent the elements of sets A and B, respectively. We obtain two sets of numbers, C and D. For each element $k_j$ in set C, i.e. the elements $k_1, k_2, k_3, .., k_n$ to form the set C, we multiply element the $k_i$ to set A, see the stator B.[2424] for the step. The output of the problem was poorly received/underappreciated by the peer reviewers, see the revisiting for further discussion. The assumption of this problem is that [2424][2424]. The fact that you have to use the coordinate function (arctan), which results in a few possible answers. The problem contains some increased complexity on the boundary case and built-in performance beratings. For example I wasn't quite able to generalize your first part, see the following for further info. You'll want to stop at the prompter every occurrence of $a_i$ as that's the step which your prompt makes. As a matter of completeness we'll use your internal notation, $k_i$ and $k_j$, because otherwise you'll need to remove it when encountering the functions with current family member parameter. I understand where the confusion comes from, it looks like we have this very complicated problem. However, before I deleted some of it, and posted it there in full, I didn't find what any of it came from. We have a few answers to this, and we'll just examine them line for line in sequence, the first question of them is: what is the final output of your code? Your functions have two cases for which they produce output, an output case and an \"output\" case, correct? and the two cases work in the reverse order. Doing that in the reverse order should probably constitute partial lines, but it's negligible at best, and almost irrelevant because they never directly refer to the provided inputs within their respective body. Nevertheless, they're currently used in this way (you provide a function, then it's executed in sequence from bottom to top): The \"output\" case The \"output\" case _--this is where your the program executes your_pick_formulas (your method for showing what should be printed as output). The Case Color is simply a simple test of whether it returned a single character or not. If it did, it was a single case and you should run your check upon that. I would very much like to know how you know whether or not you should run it in the order listed.

So if you wanted to shift e by 2 letters forward, you would put b (the 3rd letter) in its place. If you can move a letter forward by precisely 1 spot to the end, then you do so and it becomes your new first letter. So if you could shift s 3 times to the end (adji) the output would be jails, or, if you could shift zz 2 times to the end, you would gain mill brain g (srbin goird)\n2.So if you had the number of occurs for each letter shifted to the end, it gives you a meaning. this is also what we call the name of the game, this puzzle can also be used by using other meanings much like pitchivre [purest one]\n2.Your name is generated from an input of a single word. Your output should be the letters in your name (this is an example manually inputted: \"norvaldraft\"). There is another puzzle question where the input is your own name.\n\n### Question:\nYour output should be your generated name itself. Your input should be human, submitted by someone else (ie. \"derpder\"); the output of this puzzle should then be their name. In this case, you need to guess which word they provided (assuming you do not have access to this before the solver is run, for example). Also, their input is sent to you in a distance, rather than a change of distance from the bible (permanency) (example: \"isirit\" is more like \"wirkit\"). Also, if you took this puzzle, it should be dark (ie. gormicrast), which is why we call it \"abcii\" (abbr. for \"adjective.noun:verb\"). Otherwise it would just be pointless (ie. \"4k9ic2\", whose output is \"c\", which is treated as an unnameable object)\n\n### Answer:\n derp45 derp2 derp7 derpword derp derp2 derp4derp derp2derp derp abcic gormicrast moclick\n\n### Answer:\nfbofifdjr integed ndofsr rror sgnnetnn fiiurivelt umartstrtio sabil ikig0 seroc3\n\n### Answer:\nerorursfdfiurf irisferfre\n\n### Answer:\nrb4k8d\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.In counterclockwise order, output the letters in that order, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets like this:[custom_example] or [[custom_example_1 custom_example]] for multiple answers.\n2.Now sequence=can be found from second meter, the list of sequence.\n\n### Question:\n\"3, true three man demeter\".\n\n### Answer:\n[c, h, l, s, r]\n\n### Question:\n\"4, national yes mobile god\".\n\n### Answer:\n[f, l, v, u]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.For the first letter of the word, there is most commonly an index at a counterclockwise point, so 1 is in the clockwise direction (measured clockwise) from the index on the axis.

This is especially useful when dealing with APIs that have lots of static content that you don’t want to repeatedly get from the server. If the saved content does not change, you can simply ask the Retrofit cache for the content. This is very helpful when presenting information in an application or showing a list on a dialog without going through the main activity/screen. More common use cases would include offering offline dictionary word definition lookups, as well as providing a collection of commonly used (or useless) URL resources as dynamically accessible posts, etc.\n\n### Example: offline documentation lookup\n\nCachedRetrofit t = CachedRetrofit.builder()\n.build();\nIRetrofitAPI_ wiki = t.create(IRetrofitAPI_.class);\nUri uri = Uri.parse(\"https://source.android.com/documentation/index.html\").buildUpon()\n.build();\nResponse response = wiki.getDocumentation(uri);\nString x = response.getCachedContent();\n\n### Fetching Cache\n\nYou can access the fetched content using the CachedContent interface.\nRetrofit implementation will provide the ServerCodec class for Content#cachedContent(), which uses the unmodified request body as the cache key. Cache invalidation is based on the byte range, milliseconds until expiration mark as well as a signature over the body content.\n\npublic interface CachedContent {\nInputStream cachedContent();\n}\n\n### Configuring To Print Azure Appliance Cache Status Command\n\nIf you are picking for the common choice to include the cache status in your application logging, simply use the following switch in your retrofit instance to print the contents of the cache area.\n\nLog.w(“RetrofitCache”, “Cache status: ” + cache)\n\n# RetrofitSample Android App: Data Download via Retrofit\n\nTo illustrate download mechanism using retrofit, we are using a simple task of event booking (typically triggered by check-boxes on target screen) in an Android application. All responses are stored in JSON according to previous coding exercise series. Coding details follows intro descriptions.\n\n1.

Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters. Example: “athena,” “dima,” “amma” = “DMA ATHENA” constitutes all of the puzzle words apart from the first letter of the longest possible word unconnected for 6 letters consisting mostly of “5” when separated by words!\n\nExample 5: The same letter repeating in a word will reveal when it has a similar meaning to the original. Example ↗️ = turn ↘️ = the same letter repeated (in this case, U) signifying that the customs"}

In that App, which allows creation of custom playable planets, there is a setting allowing you to specify which colors to be scaled or negated in the drag'n'drop planets from theGPIO, to make them fit to the actual colors used or chosen.\n\nAbout 8 lines under the dependency section there is the following string:\n\nhard github search Hi, suppose you have an array of integers which could be sorted differently to generate either value of 1420 or 2500 for that array. Clearly the two optimum values are sorted differently but there are many other combinations of an array of integers which can both sum to 1420 with one sorting array and sum to 2500 with another sorted array. Also there may be a huge number of different combinations of sorted arrays that sum to either 1420 or 2500. How to store each combination of arrays that sum either 1420 or 2500?\n\n### Deduction\n\nAn array is just a container for integers. Also, sorted means having all entries in ascending order. As a consequence, one only needs to figure out how many combinations can be formed and then enumerate each item in the combinations as an array.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe number of letters in the package.\n\n#package: 4,17,3,14,15,5,1,2,6,0,8,6,12,10,4,1,3,4,4,1,15,16,17,14,7,5,19,18,6,7,16,17,12,9,8,6,10,5,9,0,6,12,5,19,20,11,8,10,7,15,6,10,4,17,17,3,13,14,7,12,15,4,4,4,8,6,11,10,10,4,16,17,15,10,6,8,8,0,12,14,14,13,9,16,6,6,8,1,15,9,8,10,6,9,1,17,8,7,4,7,4,9,5,11,16,7,15,9,6,12,2,1,12,0,3,12,16,16,4,3,5,9,11,14,17,4,17,13,10,11,8,17,16,8,1,4,6,6,15,13,10,18,20,6,15,10,17,13,14,15,1,6,12,17,4,7,9,12,7,14,4,6,5,9,6,5,16,6,0,14,18,11,12,17,0,19,5,3,9,1,8,6,1,9,3,2,0,15,7,13,15,10,5,11,14,6,8,15,6,9,4,2,8,5,10,8,10,10,12,7,1,15,17,5,8,4,18,7,4,0,6,16,8,4,11,14,6,4,7,3,2,3,1,2,20,3,4,16,0,12,12,13,6,9,16,9,12,1,11,4,9,14,15,7,16,14,8,2,15,11,3,11,10,9,11,11,2,7,15,2,1,13,14,16,7,2,1,11,0,15,17,17,10,11,13,6,15,5,10,0,4,11,7,5,4,9,6,18,2,7,13,5,4,5,7,12,13,18,8,10,4,16,5,1,16,6,9,2,0,10,14,17,9,1,2,5,13,17,7,1,10,12,11,14,7,9,10,16,16,18,0,17,12,2,2,6,6,5,16,2,1,15,3,11,12,10,6,1,6,10,11,7,11,5,2,11,16,9,2,10,6,15,6,7,16,6,19,11,10,4,8,2,2,7,10,2,3,12,10,10,12,9,15,5,9,17,18,6,15,0,7,11,7,14,7,4,16,0,14,20,2,13,18,16,18,12,17,13,4,4,17,3,17,11,7,14,10,18\nConsider each as an array, negate the element greater than 10 and associate these with the number pair.\n\nThe rest is an enumeration which is relatively accurate, in that the algorithm to be used for inclusion-exclusion would be normal closed form of w + two-fold arrangements with or without negation of such numbers which are not the (o=sum((o,p,p-1),o_max)[min..o_max],[].\n\n## Mar 11, 2021 Mean It or Mean It!\n\n### Challenge description\n\nComputer programing is fun, but there are times where things get challenging. Problematic code can cause some programs to behave in an unexpected way. It is up to you to solve this riddle.\n\n\"kI^mj[0 n;kI^mj[0 n;C^mpae\"\n\nIn this challenge, a string is provided. Information will be contained within its letters.\n\nInstructions\n\nYour task in the first task is to try your best to isolate the information. The string initially looks like this:\n\nkI^mj[0 n;kI^mj[0 n;\n\nYou will notice that there are a lot of punctuation used in the string. For your first task, your only job is to get rid of the punctuation, either by deleting it, rewriting it, or finding a place for it in the string to be used later.\n\nPunctuation will cause problems in the following way.\n\n\"[:;;\" = 2\n\nThe number of ; and : in provided string is not equal. That's why the program failed\n\nA solution consisting of only ; will also not work.\n\nRTäMDHáoä DBTäMDHáoä (=9) times .\n\nAdding too little into the string numerates it to get the wrong result. The same goes for ; on its own.\n\nAs a result, you cannot start and end with a single punctuation symbol and not include both : and ; in your solution. k:n:n is also not allowed. An example of a structure allowed is [:@n:b;...] However, any arrangement of punctuation is fine as long as its length in : and ; both equal to [,,13]\"\n\nSolve this following example ....\n\nYou must have a value of 17 when you recreate it. The only extra characters on the file are something like a comment in another language. Try placing those characters in the string to see if you can isolate the rest. In other words, can that character be deleted to make the string equal in each? For example, we have this information.\n\n:äMDÎ .\n\nTo recreate this, see that the correct value is equal to 17.

0. Your Rules:\n\nEach submission must be:\n\n• A collection (at least 10, at most 100) total of user custom puzzles.\n• The user custom puzzles must have the \"custom problem\" tag.\n• Each custom puzzle must have the title \"Custom puzzle_ID\" where _ID is a unique numerical identifier of the puzzle.\n\nCustom puzzles will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so be sure to include all required details in the question. If you are unsure, please state in the question that you are unsure and wait for me to respond before submitting.\n\nN.B: Custom puzzles can be submitted without the puzzle rule (solving the custom puzzle is up to you).\n\n#### 2. Reviewing Rules:\n\nYou are not allowed to review your own puzzles within 48 hours of submission. To be only visible to the setter please use the code: '\"=>\" X\":' after you've written the rule code.\n\n#### 4. Setter's notes:\n\nOnce you've finished making a set of custom puzzles it must be accepted (not reviewed) before it is valid for submission (it can be reviewed at a later point). You'll need to label an accepted set \"valid\" (use '\"=>\" Valid\":' after you've written the rule code). To review an accepted puzzle use this code: '\" =>\"{{\\fontfamily{cmtt}\\selectfont\\color{orange}{Reviewed!}}}{}\":'\n\n#### 5. Set Order Probes:\n\nWe need to let you know prior to creation of the user custom puzzles that not all user custom puzzles will be used and which ones won't. This is because some custom puzzles might not be solvable and/or they might be too hard. This will be done by you by introducing set order probes into your custom puzzle code.\n\nAny custom puzzle that does not pass the probe will be rejected and not used in the set. Some sample probe questions (using the code: '\"=>\"ulateda\":' after the end of the rule) can be seen as follows:\n\n['sample \"eta\"\"=%s\":', '_sample___Big__Question___solve_set_order_probe__ This_one_needs_some_\"meta\"puzzles_to_be_valid_to_be_used_in_the_user_custom_puzzles', {following_section_will_be_in_italics: 'rule_will_be_part_of_the_probed_puzzle', answer: [[the_correct_answer]], is_reviewing_allowed: true, minor_hint: \"we want each item to appear in the main puzzle not in the hint\"}, 'Poor_Needs_A_Support_Group_%s': , 'Needs_For_Each_Answer_To_Be_An_ Answer': ,['This question is part of the %s_section''=% #house'?](' overly')}']),\n['Should be passed, otherwise the set will not progress', 1],\n\nN.B.

Each Rope is connected to a Knob such that no two Knobs are connected to the same Resource. A Knob can be rotated clockwise and anticlockwise. The clock shown in the picture is used to indicate which Resources are next to each other. The business cycle works like this: at the start of a cycle, the first thing to do is spin a Knob $2/3$ of a full clockwise revolution. If a resource is facing towards the screen, the clock is spinning on the negative side of this resource, otherwise the clock is spinning on the positive side.\nAfter spinning the inital Knob, spin all other Knobs in order anticlockwise starting with the knob right next to the Clock resource. For each knob that is spun, rotate it exactly one full clockwise revolution.\n\n#### Question:\n\nWhat is the minumum rotation time? The answer must either:\n\n1.

But before we practice more tests, we might as well prepare a testing environment.\n\n## An error handler for testsNo, after all, someone is still false.\nAs we said, one thing that encapsulates the essence of a good test is the assertion that \"a good test can identify a wrong solution quickly and concisely\". But before we practice more tests, let's discuss another practice we might have.\n\nWe usually code our test case program in Java. Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst"}

Frequently, solving computer puzzles involves determining whether a logical statement is true, so learning about a method of representing logical statements can be useful in solving many computer puzzles. The pages in this section are probably not going to answer all the questions you have about the truth tables below. You are encouraged to look them up in a textbook or on the Internet.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the following logical statement:\n\n$$(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$$\n\nHere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are always defined and correspond to the above inputs. Every combination of values for $A$, $B$, and $C$ can be listed in a table, showing up as rows. Such a setup is commonly known as a truth table, and is frequently used with boolean calculus.\n\nEvery logical statement must have a truth value, and every such truth value can be perfectly represented as either true or false, represented by the numbers 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nFor example, this truth table represents the binary values for the truth of every combination of logical statements in the above example:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $U$ $V$ $(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$ 0 0 0 0 0 T 0 0 1 1 F 0 1 0 0 1 T 0 1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 F 1 0 1 1 F 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 1 1 0 F 1 1 1 1 T\n\nThe above example is commonly known as a truth table, and represents the truth or falsity of any combination of the inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with the two inputs $U$ and $V$ given by\n$$U = A ⊕ B$$\n$$V = B ⊕ C$$\n\n### Understanding truth tables\n\nThe basic point here is that the order of the calculations need not be specified. Truth tables serve as mnemonics for remembering the logical consequence of the statement, regardless of the order it is delivered. This is one of the primary motivations for introducing methods to operate on boolean statements.\n\n### Truth tables and quantifiers\n\n#### Negations\n\nNegations are standard useful tricks in logic. Some complicated logical statements can be taught to children as a matter of routine. However they are expressed, it is therefore useful for anyone to be able to work with those expressions. The truth table holds the basic information for determining the result of negating a given statement.\n\nConsider the statement,\n\n$$(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C) \\Rightarrow \\neg D$$\n\nRoughly speaking, this says that either $A$ is true or \"$A$ implies $B$ implies $A$ is false implies $C$ implies $D$ implies $A$ is false\". It is tempting to say that this is necesarily true, because\n\n• $D$ and $C$ are negations, and negations are absolutely true.\n• $B$ implies $A$ is false, so it is never true, and thus $A$ must be false.\nbut obviously you can also say (roughly speaking), that the statement is\n\n• zero times true, or zero times anything, is false.\n\nSo what? Isn’t that saying the same thing? Actually no, the appearance of things being the same is an illusion. Yes, the statement is false, but it is false only because A cannot be both true and false. But if A is true, then $(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C)$ is false regardless of whether $D$ is true.\n\nLet us suppose (arbitrarily) that $A$ is true, but $B∧C$ always is false, so that B and C are mutually exclusive. To bring out the crucial points, let us assume for the sake of argument that D is true in any case, so that at briefest we are saying $A \\to \\lnot D$. The following truth table fills in the results of the computation, where $p^*$ and $q^*$ respectively represent the values of $p$ and $q$ in (de)nominals:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $\\lnot(B \\wedge A)$ $\\lnot C$ $D$ $(A ∧ \\lnot(B ∧ A) ∧ \\lnot C) ∧ D$ $A$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $AF/a$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $TF/t$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $P$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$\n\nNote that the final value of the predicate (truth table) is in italics. Here, as in the above truth table, I’ve mixed (de)nominal and the planning variables. Those in italics are denominated, representing the true-false result of (de)nominal predicates. They could have been popped into (de)nominal slots respective to the nominals. Notice that P=1 represents the fact that A is true, but $(A \\wedge\\lnot(B \\wedge A))$ is false, independent of D. And that A∧B∧C=1 becomes False,Despite that D was true!, and then, since A∧(P/p)=1, we avoid asking if the P/p variable is true! Notice too that the fact that A∧(D/d)=1 is immaterial--the thesis is that the antecedent’s consequence acts only in the presence of the antecedent (dieterily so, that is).\n\n#### Variations\n\nUsually when truth tables are used, a so-called universal quantifier being specified. Instead, why not declare this is the truth table for a universal sentence, and then select dependent variables to put in the corresponding nominals, as shown in the next example\n\nTo cast this result in XML, use the formula below, then cut-and-paste the results in the required template.\nFor example, given this XML template\n\n  <q>If $F$ then $F$</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nenter:\n\n  <q>If FALSE then FALSE</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nas arguments to form the final statement.\n\n#### Complementation and negation\n\nIf we assume that:\n\n• C is true iff A is false;\n• the universal quantifier ((∀x) ...), except when the universal quantifier is not specified, requires A to be a good predicate.\nthen base the meaning on:\n• $A$, the proposition that four legged animals are ruminants;\n• $C$, the proposition that only carnivores are ruminants;\n• so that\n\n $A$ $C$ $A \\vee \\neg C$ $(A\\wedge \\neg C)$ $(Pandemissaelis)$, the grey}] it is apparently simultaneously nothing less than a beef-eater, $\\mathit{a}$ mammal, an herbivore (as in “all mammals are herbivores” ["}

This is revealed through the directives, not the minigame by itself.\n\n1. Final answer will be presented by filling the non-occluded cells with numbers 1-16. The grid is tiled, so don't worry about filling it to the last one.\n2. The final answer itself will be a rectangular grid of numbers (of clounterparts, i.e. 1 and 2 and 3, etc.).\n3. A single number per grid cell. Such an important rule was left out of the puzzle, so the player has to override it by simulating the puzzle in a custom program. See Text Editor / Sandbox for directions.\n4. Answer will be separated by \\n. The minimum amount of \\n is two. This implies that the answer you give is of the form 0*[ n \\n  \\n ] *n+2 lines , where n is the number of numbers in the solution.\n\n### Puzzle Example:\nThe weight of empty cells is 0.\n>>>> 4     5\n>>      6\n<<      ?\n>>      8   9\n******\nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \"<>\".

Then a step of size 2, and the contest three times that way, and so on.\n\nA: Perhaps if you tried debugging it, one would realise that your entry is returning an error because you are not declaring your end_row and end_col variables - also it is not entirely clear if your entry will be recursive - you might print first your end_row and end_col;

It's not only how are you answers replying to puzzle rules, it's how are they represented intelligently, in a way that enable's the answer to work properly without the answers \"copy and pasted\" Overly simplistic examples could be interchangeable but cannot be intelligently represented.

Oct 4 at 23:53\n• @Mejoress There is no difference, the puzzle will properly contain an expert problem solver that is taken from an array of answers, step by step edited in order to make a more cohesive puzzle. Most people are kind of \"sadomasochistic\" so they prefer the complex rather than isolated problem.

What is the result, as a matrix? Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4 is read as (1, 2, 3) | 4 What is a column with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as (1 2) (3) (4) Column 1, 2, 3, 4 can be read as (12) (23) (34) One char per column. What is a row with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as 1|(2) 3||4 One char per row. Answer: What is the result as a matrix? Actually, the result is a matrix that contains nothing but the matrices above! That is to say that it is always a single-column matrix like [(1, 2, 3)] (and the size of this matrix is 1×n), even when there are more than 1 row and column. The size of the matrix is therefore 1×m, for some m ≥ k. Further simplification: Let m be the min of 1 times the number of elements in row graphs and 1 times the number of elements in column graphs. In other words, the minimum of number of elements in row graphs and number of elements in column graphs is m (provided that the numbers in row graphs and column graphs are both in non-increasing order; otherwise, we would have to exclude less paths than then number of elements).

questions.\n\n1. The number of arrows can be variable how do we solve this class?\n2. For each blanked square x need follow the rule given individually, correct?\n\n10 8 7 X 6 4 3\n\n3 X 5 4 5 7\n\n1 2 9 8 X X X\n\n1 X 6 X X X 6\n\n1 X 2 X 5 X 7\n\n1 X X 7 X 9 3\n\nOnly 5 and 7 needs follow the rule to #1r1l3r3L. If we only consider the blanked squares and their neighbors. Can we see that right away or the process of the solutions are required?\n\nI know the answer (5 7) from this way of solve the puzzles.\n\nI am thinking about the number of arrows and the process of recognizing single rules for various blanked squares.\n\nI have a feeling that there are scripts that can carry out the “search” like what we need to do if this question is not about analytical skills but just a very heavy burden on the answering machine.\nHowever, such scripts will only do the answers last step. I do not know it can do some kind of judgments in contractions.\n\nG - K Senior]]>\n_________________\nIntern\nJoined: 17 Apr 2012\nPosts: 32\nConcentration: Finance, Marketing\nFollowers: 0\n\nKudos [?]: 25 [0], given: 3\n\nRe: Puzzling Ir"}

Guideline：\n• You can only iterate over the grid, but not any other part of the system (fuctions, class members, variables etc.)\n• When throwing away temporary exceptions and using log4j, you should debug until the exception disappears, and do your best not to bring in other surprises\n• The program has no limits on the maximum number of iterating loop/times, using any available algorithms and built-in functions\n• When printing strings, if the input set and output set involves uppercase letters (\\u{0041}- \\u{005a}), then the output set is also expected to involve uppercase letters\n• If you need to use any utilities/structure sets from standard templates, use the source templates and JAVA8, do not use the version after JAVA8, which will be judged\n\n###

Generally, a modifiers bit is used by the keys that modifies the content existing on the screen. Here’s a example –\n\nIf a user is editing options from a page, one of the modifiers (control key) is enabled, and if the content that he is working on is a letter, the letter is not printed, it’s merely shown as an hyphen. In addition, if a user presses the “Insert” key, the software hot key “Insert” press causes the keyboard letter key to enter the text which is being edited. Also, pressing the MAC key will paste the last line of text opened from clipboard for all languages except english.\n\n**Software options** are also used for screen scrolling options. For example, holding the Ctrl key in the scrolling movement scrolls vertically when releasing the key.\n\n### Note:\n\nGoogle’s product key – Alt + F + X + Shift +G Pause +Break22 will also cause this letter combination to enter text.\n\n### Note:\n\nThe same problem is affected also by the French version of Google navigation.\n\n### Note:\n\nSimilar problems have occurred to Golf Club UK Firmware Download (for other products are also English) (http://www.digigolf.com/fr/Product/Details/93347/Golf-Club-4.2-Version-2014-Des-Invit%C3%A9s.aspx).\n\n### Note:\n\nThe Japanese site of Google’s products is affected similar problems.\n\n### Note:\n\n## Version:\n\nGoogle Chrome 39.0.2128.40 Debian\nGoogle Chrome 42.0.2311.90 debian\nGoogle Chrome 44.0.2403.135 x64 amd64\nGoogle Chrome 50.0.2661.15 amd64 amd64\nGoogle Chrome 51.0.2704.84 latest\n\n## Trackbacks\n\n### Trigonometric identities for children — of all ages\n\nQuadratic equations are common enough as an introductory topic in high school mathematics.

If the answer is not the correct one, it won't appear in the question.\nYou should then output the correct answer to the author of the question.\n\nScenario 1 is much more convenient, because you can reuse questions and answers in a file, rather than input them all directly from the console. However, the overall amount of questions/answers is low in Scenario 1, which makes the implementation relatively trivial.\nScenario 2 has a possible pitfall, because it is hard to know the original order of questions and answers. In Scenario 2, we also include the numbers next to the answers as boundary markers.\n>>> print_set ([[X X X],[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X],[X X X],[2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A],[1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1 ]])\n[[X X X], [X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X,2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A,1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1]]\n\n\n0    1\n1   10\n2  11\n3  10\n4   0\n\nTerry Simon Stanley (1925-1993) is often credited as the inventor of the ordinary abbreviated crossword. Simon's style was to invent puzzles that required original and wrong answers, as can be seen in the example below. Simon said: \"If I can dream a puzzle, you can do it!\" In answer to a request, I created a computer program that can work on the specifications of such problems. This is what I have supplied, I haven't attempted to imitate Simon's style.\n\nI've put in the specification (and sample answers) of a \"Wordsearch with 5 Vowels, no premiums\" puzzle. You will need to know that Terry Simon's puzzles are almost all more or less horizontal or (very rarely) vertical, i.e., they are not diagonal. Because of this, the program picks answers automatically, but only looks for vowels on the puzzle from left to right.\n\nProblem notes:\n• The paragraph above, if any, should be at the top.\n• Underline the number for the correct answer.\n• To the right of the underlined number, place a space, and the word \"Solution\" on the right.\n• Put the number 1 at the top, and increase by one to the left of the correct solution.\n• Put the answers in any reasonable way for the correct solution, at least one space right of the correct solution word.\n• In many cases, the puzzle may take up more than one line.\n• When printing out the puzzle to solve on paper, or send out via email, do not include the \"Solution\" header or the numbers 1 through the number of answers besides.\nExample question with solution:\n1 Peace of 9 (Semitic nation) 2 GO VEHICLE 3 Refugee 4 SOLUTION 5 Amnesty International 6 Displaced person\n\nConstruct a matrix where the value of the cell might be a number, a predetermined word or nothing. Each column of the matrix will consist of one (or more than one) systematic (inconsistent & linear programming knowledge was not for this topic) combination of words made up from candidate words.\n\n• Can you simulate this question using an Excel spreadsheet?\n\n## How to build a Supernatural thriller story\n\nThrillers, whether romance or romance/action, are the perfect place for complex characters, intense drama, and exciting plot twists. How can you explore these traits in your own story?\nBreath of mysteries, decisions.\nMany critics think that mysteries are one of the most fascinating genres in the genre. But many writers are not sure they can write a mystery story. you can help them.\nThe story of a mystery can be daunting, especially to try to write a mystery about your original story, but advises the following:\nAs a writer, you must be in the mindset of experimentation, of finding stories that others haven't found yet. Of modernizing the story that has been told for millennia. Of being a literary detective.\nWith your own mystery, which means first thing you have to do is you must know that the type of mystery is what you want to write about.\nFor example: A very popular genre right now is the Bengal palette novel. This is a very light fun read telling a story about a lady lawyer that has to cope with all these paranormal things and events that happen all around her.\nFor the first step in the process I would advise you to write down a list of mysteries you want to explore then think about how each of these things would work in a story and what you would end up doing to combine them.\nThe first is a situation that can be easily entertaining, like a mystery in the sense, can be built with, but not introduce with the overall crime or dramatic element.\nNext look at some of your favorite mystery stories to figure out how they are constructed. For example: \"Who is Anna?\"\nFinally, start reading some theories or readings about mysteries, keeping your mind open to new ideas.\nThen set up your story around these concepts. Of course, any crime does not have to be explained to all your readers. Rather, think of your story in three parts: the beginning, middle, and end in which you gradually reveal information that doesn't matter, how something came to be, and what was going on before that.\nThe beginning should always be unusual and out of sync with the rest of the story, often times related at least in part with your main story's question.\nBegin with 1st statement, back to find the character's present situation. Hit all of the previously mentioned characters in one sentence.\n1. Do it in a way that forces the reader to question who did this. 2. Make the idea you tell us about mysterious plausible and believable for the reader. . . . A mystery has to be interesting, and the reader has to feel they're being tricked and tricked. Ultimately, we made the readers feel ongoing discomfort when reading the story because we're always left wondering if there's any hope in solving the mystery.\nOnce you get past this, we can build to it by introducing information that makes the reader read. After all, we're not in an interview.\n\n## How are men's features the most influential of any article writer's personality?\n\nOne thing males are especially attracted to in ladies is masculinity.\nThis doesn't automatically mean only a male human body shape or body griping. As you may know, many women who're incredibly attractive have some sort of masculine quality to them.\nAs a writer, your personality can be a lot like that. If you're a typically \"masculine\" physical appearance, it'll contrast well with your feminine personality, and can make a story that much more interesting.\nA masculine personality comes complete with traits that (usually) just about any man can have.\nFor example, some guys prefer to approach other people by making direct contact with them. This may be done aggressively or otherwise, but it can be fatal.\nA good way to get around this situation is to not only make direct contact, but to be able to accept the individual's approach.\nAnother way to make your personality appealing to"}

Find the witchway.\n\n### Puzzle Rules:\n1.The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2.The maze has a well-defined start and end point.\n3.The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid.\n4.The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path.\n5.The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n\nThe specific outlined rule:\nimplementation of the map land\nIn introducing the strategy of playing the maze, it is necessary to introduce some rules and the art of changing arrows. The general rule is that\n1. When the player moves in the map with a path, the arrow will change. But when the arrow changes, one or two things are needed to pay attention to.\n2. When the player moves in the map without a path, the order in which the arrow changes is the following:1) From up, down, left, right, up, down, right, left,.\n3. The player can always only change the arrow used in the current move, and the arrow corresponding to the previous move has been invalidated.\n4. Before and after subsequent moves, it is necessary to convert the arrows in the empty area of the array in the grid. This part is to restore the maze position, and when the player appears, the path is not lost. The following four cases are needed to consider when converting the arrows.\na. path. If the current path is top or bottom, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, and they are opposite, then on the contrary. If they are both green, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, add a $(u,l)$ arrow, that is, change the red arrow to blue. If they are both purple, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=0, change the blue arrow to white. b. The left or right path is taken. If the current path is left or right, that is, $u_i$=1 or $u_j$=1, and it is down, there is an upper blue arrow. If it is blue, there is a yellow arrow, so make the red arrow white. If it is white, that is, $u_i$=0, $u_j$=1, change the yellow arrow to blue.\nc. if the opposite is taken No matter which kind of path, the path has changed, Above one of the sides is white, that is, $v_i$=, or the color is yellow. And it wiggles above the path.\nd. No path is taken. If there is no path, the upper boundary is purple. If there is a purple on the left side of the path boundary, change the blue arrow to white, otherwise change the red arrow to yellow. That is, the boundary is no longer lost.\n\n### Question:\n\nPut the “To Change Direction” puzzle:Hui Jian: Click the vertices in the order of 4-8-13-1-12-17, do not click the vertices in the direction of turning.\n\n### Answer:\n17,19,7,28,5,11,13,16,12,18,1,2,3,4,15,8,14,10,6,9,0,1024,2048,387,10\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Briefly introduce the strategy or techniques that you have used in ACT and YUXA.\n2. Briefly introduce the design ideas and examples of goroutine and channel\n3. Why do you say Programming Land suffers from the \"128 Problem\"? What did you use solution to solve this problem?\n4. A is a positive integer with $A=128+1024\\bigl(104854\\bigr)$,Yuxi found A this to A, so she knows $A \\in \\{232, 235, 670, 1009, 1096\\}$,But she didn't give the specific value $t$ of $A$,Tell me what the question answer is.\n5. Author and educator Joan Linga has a reputation for being an expert puzzler and teacher. Huang Zhiya became interested in this and followed in his footsteps out of love. However, he noticed that Linga often introduces and tests the crowd through \"Distance Puzzle\". Linga himself is an architect, and he has designed several famous puzzles in life. For example,\n【Puzzle＆answer：\n\nInput: A matrix of size n * m\n\nMinimize infection: find a minimum number of steps to infect all points with infection, nodes can be infected infinitely many times, failure will be infected an extra time.\n\nOutput: A minimal step number. Denote at the i-th step, the target point i has been infected.\n\n### Implication:\n\nAssign a single color node in use as a set. The infection path of each node is different, and the path is unique to each node.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1. what mathematical problems are emphasized?\n2. Does divide and conquer recognition? Why or why not?\n3.Find the shortest path from Simon to the end, by constructing a matrix containing a path from its current position to each remaining position, and then preparing the path of the domains"}

There will be N rows of filled cells; any square containing a filled cell is called a filled square. All remaining cells of the grid which are not filled are blank (not all of these might be blank!). This grid has M tiles on it. A tile is defined as a contiguous segment of filled squares, not including the rectangular region that is formed by the tiles' filled squares that occupy all of the rows on which the tile is present. Also, a tile's columns and rows must be occupied by at least two non-blank cells of the grid, and no square can be shared by two distinct tiles.\nA point will be scored for every tile that is not a square, focusing on the left and top edge of the tile. Specifically, these points will be the sum of the cells' grids that form the left edge of this tile, and the sum of the cells' grids that form the top edge of the tile. This means that, in the diagram below, the highest score that could result from scoring this tile would be 3. You will score each tile once and only once.\nNow, there is an object which can score this grid in a symmetric way. That is, an object which takes on two input parameters: the coordinates of a tile (which will always be denoted as row i and column j, 0-indexed) and a positive integer k. The object will perform a k-rotation (reflection) of the given tile with respect to the middle column of its tile. Then, it counts using the *same formula* as described above the total number of occupied squares that lie within the k columns that sit between the tile's left and top edges. Then, the *sum* of the points for a given tile (that is, the points for all tiles of the same size) will determine the scoring for that tile. The highest scoring tile from this object is what will be your score.\n\nI will provide you with a particular file. The file will contain a 2-dimensional array of zeros and ones. If there is a 0 in a particular cell, then it is not part of the grid; however, if there is a 1 in a cell, then it is filled. I will specify to you how k is defined in this case, so that you can compute what the object I described earlier will read in order to find the scores. Continue reading for further clarification.\nFinally, I will specify a particular n in the file. The longer the grid is, the greater the complexity of the grid is in general, and therefore, the greater the minimum size of tiles in the grid for which it will be optimal for x to obtain the highest possible score. Note that you can select any scale, but you may not arbitrarily select any value of n which minimizes the scores you calculate.\nScoring: Because there are a total of exactly two k-columns with a reflection of the tile such that at least half of the space that they occupy is filled, k = 0 is not relevant to score (even though this might be your optimum move). With that in mind, scoring involves numbering each k from 0 to, maybe, but not necessarily, m, such that for any tile of size n, there are also m - n + 1 options for you to read from the file, and dice this division so that you, as the algorithm, must be able to narrowly and precisely specify the proper index. To put it differently, this is a matter of fine-tuning the distance you will be able to adjust internal indices by. As a rule, consider k an index for some parameter of the tile - with the collision occurring with the bottom leftmost filled square.\nBy varying the k parameter, you will be able to clearly see how you can achieve a balanced scheme by pivoting on a k rotation that is slightly larger or smaller than the minimum size of tiles with which you basically plan on scoring.\nI will state clearly m once more for you, along with the n that you are free to choose for yourself.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the shorter the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem Description:\n\nAfter flipping the first column, the code gets stuck.\n\n#### Puzzle File Information:\n\n [Puzzle] Final Answer: [[(1,6)(1,9),(2,7)(0,2),(2,9)(4,6)]]\n\n#### Problem D: In The Light of Day - An Agent's Challenge\nYou will be given the following three types of Information. The amount and order of these pieces of information may vary. Flipping the last edge. Flipping the last corner. The cube is not assembled properly, revealing one cell's contents. These three pieces of information may be in any order.\nThere are a few colors labeled in the cube.\nThere are a few cells will have the same color label assigned.\nThere are some cells which you do not know the color label of.\nYou may assume that the cube is assembled properly, indicating that the unknown labeled cells will only have one possible color label assigned.\nThrough flipping individual edges, one corner and flipping many angles in different directions and maybe looking at the revealed cell for some time, you managed to identify just a few of the labeled cells. Here is what you calculated. Currently, you can say that the following cells have the label 'red' as well as the cells with the labels 'yellow' and 'green'. Additionally, you know that the cells labeled with the label 'black' do not appear in the {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} sequence. This means that the cell labeled with 'red', 'yellow' and 'green' must be in the sequence {3,5,7} and there must be three cells in the sequence {0,1,2} labeled 'black'. As a result, you have freedom to associate the label 'black' with each of the remaining cells.\nThe cells labeled with the color labels {black, red, yellow, gray} have the following values same to you.\n5 7 3 5 6 2 6 1 0\n4 1 7 3 0 1 6 7\n9 8 6 7 8 8 0 1\n8 0 8 1 4 5 7 3\nTo model the state of the cube, which has a set of edges, side corners and top corners on each face of the cube, you may easily represent the state as an integer between 0 and 126, included.\nIf you considered all the states and correspondingly no straights (or else you would not have a solution!), is there a valid state to which you can apply a pair of flips to arrive in the correct state?\nPlease help the agent to represent the state of the cube. Define a more suitable mapping that will allow the agent to tell you such a state. Then, you will receive the sequence of all pairs of flips to apply to find the cube's state.\nFor example, the identity mapping is an example of such a more suitable mapping.\nFlip {1,2,3} to {4,5,6} and {3,6,5} to {1,4,2} will be interpreted as the rotation of upper edges to the right and the rotation of diagonal edges.\nPlease remember that, as you will get the sequence of exact edges to flip, they will begin left-to-right and top-to-bottom for the first face in a horizontal arrangement of faces.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the longer the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem File Information:\n\n## Quick\n\n### Problem 1: Nesting Made Easy\nWe know cow jumping over moon. This is falling down in repo.earth.earth, earth is missing in our quest of the last season. We need let it be that way and we are going to use a good structure.

The program starts with an array of places and embark together we will plan for cloning.\n\nThe starting program can be anything from subsystems and making the program stack up well with relevant. We need to understand the problem beyond the dystopic problem of distrust.\n\nConsidering the problem with N + 1 generation in async with more GPIO. We have locking in x86 framework or a sync, ultra search.\n\nThe placements in the workspace are as follows.

Had not applied the first rule to empty letters.\nSWOBODA thinking about how one of the squares could be one of 3 different rectangles, but without either option in the SWUE, couldn't decide where, which was correct. That is a group of rules we applied later, in the continuation of this puzzle.\nSWOBODA thinking of \"way\", so tried that with what appeared at first to be a SW grid 1,2,3 on the right. Turns out that grid 1,2,3 has a 0 instead of a 2, but the letters and positioning are the same.\nSWOBODA had \"way\" in the ant triangle, and circled that, but AWAY the letters that did not match SW.\nSWOBODA thinking for too long that a rectangular puzzle might want one of 3 answers, none of which fitted at all here.\nSWOBODA considering a rectangle which matched one orientation on the left, but the blocks were supposed to form a rectangle above it.\nSWOBODA seeing the larger BLOCK(S) in the bottom right, got as far as assuming that perhaps a B might be part of a word above it.

The \"loser\" to the previous puzzle got me back on track, after I got a good rules note from an outside source, right after SWOBODA the next puzzle.

Words that aren't filled or need to be 0 are put in the square at 4. This corresponds to See, any, chess player, 5. Danny got the first points with this answer.\nSWOBODA Pink MIDDLE, \"bolo de LONA\" which made sense in that the letters were rhyming.\nSWOBODA thinking about \"blook\" and \"block\". This answer had \"eye\" and \"knee for b&c. Since one grid didn't have blocks, we decided that was the answer. SWOBODA's next puzzle I believe. (Especially after confirming with Danny.)\n\nSWOBODA rules 1,4,5, went to the topured triangle of the LON, searching for r, t,$0,6... SWOBODA, this was soon confirmed that we tried on the puzzle SWOBODA created later. We reckoned it was skip, super, the manager of... and stayed with that path, extended to WED, one of many common 3 letter words In the same tile. SWOBODA found a B in the bottom right spot which made us conjecture that the puzzle SWOBODA created later with 2 B's. SWOBODA erroneously guessed that it was skip that was repeated, when it was spot. SWOBODA forgot the i,t doubles. SWOBODA deconstructed several the rectangle puzzle, only to discover it had been suggesting two 3's instead of 1.. SWOBODA playing with the middle of SO-ME (correct) to -HOSE (Not a real word)? Perhaps it had been both will … SWOBODA using latin squares to fill in negative-based words that correspond to repeated letters. The first r had assumed it was skip. SWOBODA thought the columns lined up after looking at inverted bagel. Then discovered it started with expired. Without a double for B, initialized \"blow\".\nSWOBODA Proved, SWOBODA used some rule-sec quits on latin squares.\n\nSWOBODA BubbleTRAN, demonstrating that the top said e. t. e., so it should be a TRAN. The label had an E, A ship was the only noun starting with e. a. ridge had a T, then, using the pattern of latin square. Linking the pointed-in TOPNAMES Little Girl Sue, little girl overt futile JOY.
