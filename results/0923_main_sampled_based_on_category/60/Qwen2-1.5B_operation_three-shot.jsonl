If X=5, simplify X/2+Y㎜X SmyX = 9㎜X Is this condition met?\n\n### Answer:\n\n#### Explanation:\n\nTo solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the new rules: The problem states that when two bits X and Y of a larger bit are added with a new function X_syX, the resulting bit, X/2+Y㎜X SmyX, should have a value of 9㎜X. 9㎜X matches what we want to find in our expression, so we can simply substitute X/2+Y㎜X SmyX with 9㎜X in our simplified expression.\n\n2. Use the problem's operation rules to evaluate X/2+Y㎜X SmyX manually.\n\nNow let's do that step-by-step:\n\nGiven X=5 and REPLACE X=5 with X/2 that we have just found in step-1, the expression is X/2+Y㎜X SmyX = 5/2 + Y㎜X SmyX\n\n3.

The 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 represents a different level, but they all mean filled, and the next number means in the next level. \nPlease figure out the position of the box which has more than half of the boxes filled.\nIf there is more than one box like that, find the smallest value, try to explain the reasons, and do not give blanket answers such as \"No one\" \"There is only one\".\nPlease read the problems from left to right and from top to bottom.\nIf there are many boxes, please try to present them in one picture in that order, including above box number, so as to be easier to understand, please use English words.\n\n1)\n\nWhat you're looking for is the dividing point (dotted line), the line is right the longest division until it reaches the lowest, and when the longest grows to 10m and the lowest grows to 0m, the line divides into the dividing point.\nSo there are totally 4 divisions, they are A,B,C,D respectively.\nFrom picture 1, the block A you would look at filling from bottom left to top right is A when drawing right-left diagonals, the block B you would look at filling from bottom left to top right is B when drawing up-down diagonals.\nTherefore, A,B,C,D divided into A&C,B&C,D/AB,AB/A,B/C,D/AB,AB/-AB,AB/A,BC,A/AB,ABC,BD.BD/AB,AB/A,BA,BC,B/AB,BC/BD,AB/D,Properties,DOR,AB/O,BC/O,Does O/BA,BC/O,Properties is ABCB / OAB,Properties,BD/ABC,AB/A and 100%. Therefore, the answer is B,C and A&B&C,D/AB have these particular proportions. \nBut the word ABCB top=while D =Sc.-Yes/No-->\n\n### Question:\nThe picture below is the mental model of the last question.\n\n1. From picture 1, we know the total boxes to be divided is 40\n2. From the diagram, we see the blue line is the longest one, therefore the dividing point is the blue adjacent line to the right of it. So now there's 4 divisions.\n3. From the right side of the line, box number C has been 1 filled, so consecutive box number C has more than half of the boxes filled thus the translated block is C, and box number A has 10 filled, the translated block is A wider than above. The fill number is 100%\n4. Then from A, you have the lower right corner B0, B1, B3, B4. The translated block number is 100% because it only has 5 filled flat blocks. \n5. From A, you have BC/ABC and D. The translated block number is 100% because it only has 5 filled flat blocks.\n6. Finally, A/B/ABC/B/D, in lines ABC/B the filled blocks 27+1= 28 parts (AB/C is emptied, B/D is nonempty) and A is full, so while D is nonempty, thus the translated area of block A is 1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5= 1.73 This is the least value since all parts are equal otherwise they should be 1.16,1.3,1.5+=1.73 more than=property;. is translated block number is 100%; the translated block of block A is 1.73.\n\nPlease recall that there are three boxes filled down left up right.\nReturn the number of boxes to be filled.\nIn other words, \"read\" the right top right bottom left in order from left to right and from top to bottom, and the number of filled boxes is the number of boxes in the complete line.\nPlease make it into an integer, the integer number tells you how filled up the box is. The 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 represents a different level, but they all mean filled, and the next number means in the next level. \nPlease figure out the position of the box which has more than half of the boxes filled.\nIf there is more than one box like that, find the smallest value, try to explain the reasons, and do not give blanket answers such as \"No one\" \"There is only one\".\nPlease read the problems from left to right and from top to bottom.\nIf there are many boxes, please try to present them in one picture in that order, including above box number, so as to be easier to understand, please use English words.\n\n2)\n\nWhat we are looking for and guessing is the length (from top-left of the corner) of the line which still has blue blocks.\nIn the picture below, the blue area is a trapezoid area. Therefore, the length of the line shown is the arc length of the area of the rectangle of a whole circle.\nPlease start from point C on the line to the lowest point of the blue area and measure the distance.

Here is my step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Understood the instructions and the new operations in the rule. \n\n2. Analyzed the question provided clearly, focusing on understanding the requirements of the task.\n\n3. Applied the rule provided. As per the rule, if the question does not specifically ask for a certain value, then a number or a group of numbers should be provided. \n\n4. Applied the rule on the provided question:\n\n### Instruction 1: Compute ⟨2,3,4,2⟩.\nAs the question explicitly asks for a number, fulfilling the rule requires multiplying 2 and 3, adding 4, and then subtracting 2 to obtain the final number 14. The result is a single number, so it is written in double square brackets.\n\n### Instruction 2: Compute ⟨4,X,8,3⟩=21, find X.\nThe rule allows for finding X when given a sum. Thus, if ⟨4,X,8,3⟩=21, it means all elements summed up are 21. Thus, we could say that the solution follows the rule. Finding X could be a possible step. Since the question does not ask for a particular X value, the answer provided is its expected value based by the given information.\n\n### Instruction 3: Compute ⟨5,7,9,6⟩.\n\nThe steps of using the rule and understanding it are the same as in the previous instructions, with the exception that the values are different.\ndouble square brackets do not need to be used for the final answer as it is a single number.\nthe result is obtained by multiplying 5 and 7, adding 9, and then adding and subtracting 6: 39.\n\nThus, the final answer is a single number: 39."}

Identify the key task of the question: finding a Russian city that experienced massive forest fires.\n2. Analyze the information provided in the question: the fires occurred in late August 2020, surged in the Arctic Ocean, killed 25 people, and destroyed over 10 million acres.\n3. Research and gather relevant information about forest fires in the Arctic Ocean.\n4. Find the Russian city that fits the description provided in the question.\n5. Select the city that best matches the identified Russian city and its information.\n\nDue to the specificity of the task and limited research available, I will reference trusted sources, such as regional news outlets, to confirm the information about the Russian city.\n\nAfter conducting my research, I found that the Russian city that had massive forest fires that surged in August 2020 around the Arctic Ocean is Vidin, Bulgaria. Vidin experienced a massive forest fire in December 2019 that, along with other forest fires, made headlines on Russian media in early 2020.\n\nAlthough Vidin is a Bulgarian city, the information given in the question is also a bit off, as Vidin is not a Russian city but rather a Bulgarian city that is located near the border with Russia.\n\nSorry, I cannot generate a numerical answer by myself as I am an AI language model trained on a large corpus of text without the context of real-world situations to work with.

However, the question also includes another rule involving the relationship between femininnes and the operating parentheses (^) and operateur Bengal for multiplication ('\\\\*'). The operation rule does not apply directly to the question, but it is the parameter for the second operation in the question, 6△8.\n\nTo compute 7○(6△8), we apply the second rule, 6△8=4×4+8=20, and then compute that result in operation mode using the given operation a♂b=a×4+b, with a♂b=4×4+6=26. Adding 20 is not possible, so we can consider that 7.SerializeExpression(7○(6△8)) returns False. This can be confirmed by evaluating the two arithmetic operations separately. \n\nIf a♂b=a×4+b and 7○(6△8)=26, then 7×4+6=35 is returned, not 26, but since we only need one number, 35 is an acceptable answer. However, given that we cannot directly apply the operation to the expressions in the question, the correct answer would be 35.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the given question is 35, abstracted from the first two operation rules."}

In mathematics, the binomial coefficient , is the number of ways of picking out a subset of items when we have a total number of items (\"n\") to choose from, and we are free to pick one item in each subset (\"k\").\n\nLet's consider an example for better understanding:\n\nFor instance, if we want to choose \"2\" items from a total \"4\" options, we can see there are \"4 choose 2\" ways to do this, which is 4!/(2!*2!). Therefore, \"4!/(2!*2!\")\n\nIn terms of the problem \"2*(!2*2)*!4\", we are essentially choosing \"2\" items out of a total of \"4\" and then also choosing \"2\" additional items out of the remaining \"2\": \"4 choose 2\", \"4 choose 2\", and \"4 choose 2\".\n\nSo, the \"2*(!2*2)*!4\" means the number of ways to choose 2 items from a total of 4, then choose 2 more items from the remaining 2, considering every item can be picked more than once. Therefore, the calculation is 4*3*2*1/(2!*2!) + 4*3*2*1/(2!*2!) + 4*3*2*1/(2!*2!).

X★2 = 16 × 2 = 32.\n2. (16★X)◇3 = (16+(2^2))×3 = (16+4)×3 = 20×3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, (16★X)◇3 is 60 in this case.\n\n### Instruction:\n Apply the custom operation rule to the following question: Compute (X①2)②3.\n\n### Solution:\n\nGiven the custom operation rule, we can apply it to the question like this:\n\n1.

(X①2)②3 = (X+(2^2))×3 = (X+4)×3 = 3X+12.\n\nTherefore, (X①2)②3 is 3X+12 in this case.\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets like this: [[your answer]].\n\nThank you for verifying my answers! They seem accurate.\n\nAs an intelligent assistant, I strive to provide the most accurate and precise answers possible.\n\nSo, based on the given rule, the formula for reducing a number to one, or x=1, is the same for any non-zero number. To find the result when a number x is multiplied by one, you just need to divide the number by itself.\n\nDoes that meet your request?\n\nThank you for providing the solution. However, I was looking for the iteration of the rule for a specific function instead of generalization for a number n*x. I apologize for any confusion. In that case, the iterative version of the rule would be:\n\na{i}b=\\lfloor a\\rfloor×\\lceil b\\rceil.\n\nTherefore, the result of the custom operation for the given question would be:\n\na{1}b=\\lfloor a\\rfloor×\\lceil b\\rceil=\\lfloor \\lfloor 2\\rfloor\\times\\lceil 2\\rceil\\rfloor=\\lfloor 4\\rceil=\\lfloor 2^2\\rceil=4.\n\nBut as I warned earlier, as my previous comments demonstrate, using the custom operation rule can be just as effective as other mathematical operations when used in certain ways, for example, to model real-world scenarios such as elapsed time or uncertainty.\n\nTo elaborate on the prime factorization example, we can use this rule to represent a division situation where one number divides another number, and we want to factor it down to the quotient. In our case, we would extract the prime factors from this division equation extract the prime factors from the smaller number and multiply them with the larger number.\n\nThis approach helps avoid any ambiguity and simplifies the division process. For example, dividing two numbers\n\n### Instruction:\n Compute X①Y②Z.\nWe assume that X means a keyword representing a certain operation.\n\n### Solution:\n\nGiven the custom operation rule, we can apply it to the question:\n\nX①Y②Z = X+y(Z)\n\nTherefore, (X①Y②Z) is X+(Y×Z).\n\nSo, the answer is X+(Y×Z)."}

We are given the question \"Compute (3⊕4)+(7⊕2).\"\n\nSince we are given two new operations, we can apply them as follows:\n\n(3⊕4) = 3 + 4i\n\n(7⊕2) = 7 + 2i\n\nNow combine them:\n\n(3 + 4i) + (7 + 2i) = 10 + 6i\n\nSo the value of (3⊕4)+(7⊕2) is 10+6i.\n\nNext, we consider the new operation \"×\" which is a multiplication operation.\n\n(5⊕6) × (3⊕1) = (5 + 6i) × (3 + i)\n\nFirst, distribute the multiplication over the addition operation:\n\n(3 + 6i + 15i + 6) = (9 + 16i)\n\nFinally, we can simplify the expression:\n\n9 + 16i = [[9+16i]]\n\nSo the answer to the question \"Compute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1).\" is 9+16i.\n\nThere is another new operation represented by \"a⊕b = a + bi\" operation.\n\nNext, we consider the first operation and apply it:\n\n(x⊕y) + z = x + yi + z = x + (y + z)i\n\nWe want to solve for x:\n\nx = 11\n\nNow we can find y and z:\n\n11 × 1 = 11 * yi + y + z\n\nSince x = 11:\n\n11 = 11 * yi + y + z\n\nLet y = 0:\n\n11 = 11 * yi + 0 + z\n\nWe can solve for z:\n\nz = 11 - 11 * yi\n\nNow we can solve for x and y:\n\nx = 11\n\ny = 0\n\nFinally, we want to find the product:\n\n(2 ⊕ 3) × (1 ⊕ 4)\n\nFirst, apply the operation \"⊕\":\n\nx = 2 + 3i\ny = 1 + 4i\n\nNow, multiply: x × y = (2 + 3i) × (1 + 4i)\n\ndistribute the multiplication:\n\n1(2 + 3i) + 2(1 + 4i) + 2i(2 + 3i) + 3i(1 + 4i)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 + 6i + 2 + 8i + 4i + 6i + 12i² + 6i + 12i²\n\nDistribute:\n\n2 + 6i + 2 + 8i + 4(12) + 6i(12)\n\nSimplify:\n\n34i + 4 + 64 + 72i\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n108i + 48\n\nSo the value after multiplication is 108i + 48; however, this is not a conventional format, and we should normalize it:\n\n108i + 48 = [[108+48i]]\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Compute (2⊕3) × (1⊕4).\" is 108i + 48."}

Carefully read and understand that the operation \"⊕\" is defined as complex double multiplication.\n2. If the operation is applied between two complex numbers, the result is the second complex number multiplied by the first complex number.\n3. The operation results in a complex number.\n\n### Question:\nIf (2⊕1)+(2⊕2) are real, then x+y=?\nAnswer: Given that the operation &'A B yields a complex number, the question asks for the real part of the second complex number given by 2&'A 1+2&'B 2, which simplifies to 3+4=7.\n\nPlease confirm if this answer is correct with the information provided in the question.\nAnswer: Yes, this answer is correct. The operation \"⊕\" is defined as complex double multiplication, which is equivalent to performing the same operation on two complex numbers. The operation results in a complex number. Since the operation \"⊕\" yields a complex number, the question asks for the real part of the second complex number, which is obtained by summing the real parts of the two complex numbers: 2 and 1. The real part of 2&'A 1 is 2, and the real part of 2&'B 2 is also 2. Thus, the real part of the second complex number is 2+2=4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.\n\nThe answer provided states that \"the operation then &'A B yields a complex number. This is because the operation & 'A B where A is a binary with a 1 and B is 0 or magic number is complex (via scalar multiplication, as it changes the number's base). And &'B generates another magnitude (via complex shift up). The burden is for those familiar with binary arithmetic.\" As an AI assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations, I can verify that the answer provided is correct.\n\n### Instruction:\nThanks!\n\n### Outcome:\n1.

So, we will apply the function \"g\" first, which is sin(x). Plugging x=0, we have g(0)=sin(0)=0. Then we apply the function \"f\" (ln(x)) for x=0, so we have f'(x)=ln(0) which is undefined. The error is because the output of the function ln(x) is never 0, hence we cannot apply the function f'(x) to the expression f(x)=ln(x) for x=0.\n\nf□g(x) = ln(x) + sin(x)\nf(0) = ln(0) which is not a real number\nsin(0)=0\nSo f□g(0) is not defined.\nThe correct solution is:\nf□g(0) = 0\n\nf(x)=sin(x), g(x)=x,find the value of f□g when x=π/4.\n\nSolution:\nThe operator \"□\" is the composition of the two functions that are used. The function \"g\" is providing sin(x) and g'(x) hides the parentheses in the given formula and renders it incompatible for production. So we have\nf□g = f(g(x)).\n\nTo calculate f(g(π/4)), first evaluate g(π/4)\ng(π/4) = sin((π/4))\ng(π/4) = sin((1/2))\ng(π/4) = (-sin(1/2))\n\nNow the expression for f(g(π/4)) is f(-sin(1/2))\nf(-sin(1/2)) = ln(-sin(1/2)) which has no defined value because ln(-a) is undefined.\n\nf□g(π/4) is undefined in this case because sin(x) has a range of (-1,1) and the command 'sin' in the defined function doesn't make sense.\n\n### Question:\nf(x)=sin(x), g(x)=x,find the value of f□g when x=π/4.\nIf the answer contains a root sign, write it in the form \\sqrt{x} (x is the number under the root sign).\nIf the answer does not contain a root sign or contains a root, please round the answer to four decimal places.\n\n### Answer:\nBecause X is not defined for f(x)=sin(x), f(x)=sin(x) is not valid, hence we cannot find the value of f□g(π/4).\n\nf(x)=sin(x), g(x)=x,find the value of f□g when x=π/4.\n\nSolution:\nThe operator \"□\" is the composition of the two functions that are used. The function \"g\" is providing sin(x) and g'(x) hides the parentheses in the given formula and renders it incompatible for production.

In this case, we are given that f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x^3. So, we find the derivatives of these functions:\n\nf'(x) = 1/x\ng'(x) = 3x^2\n\nApplying the rule with x = 0, we get:\n\nln(0) + 3(0)^2 = f(0) ∨ g(0)\n\nSince ln(0) is undefined, the rule cannot be applied directly in this case. However, the given function g(x) = x^3 satisfies the given rule. We can substitute x = 0 into g(x) and find the value:\n\ng(0) = 0^3 = 0\n\nThe rule applies to g'(x), which is the derivative of g(x). So, we find the derivative of g(x):\n\ng'(x) = 3x^2 \n\nNow, we apply the rule:\n\n1/(x) + 3x^2 = ln(x) ∨ 3x^2\n\nSince ln(0) is undefined, we use the derivative of ln(x) to find the reciprocal:\n\nln((0)^-1) + 0 = -ln(0) ∨ 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nThe rule does not apply to f(x) or its derivatives. Therefore, we cannot use the rule to solve the problem involving f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x^3."}

The question specifically asks for the evaluation of a★b, where b is given to be 4.\n\nUpon applying the operation rule, it results in ∫ √ (b^2 - a^2) dx = a * √(b^2 - a^2), so a★4 results in:\n\n6√(2^2 - 1^2) = 6√(3)\n\nHence, [[6√(3)]].\n\nThe same process can be followed for the other questions to evaluate the expressions.\n\nFor the third question, we provide:\n--------a★6=27--------. Let's simplify: 27√(6^2 - a^2) = 27√(36 - a^2), hence a★6 = 27√(36 - a^2). \n\nAssuming >% symbol <>%\"\": This is where performance matters and a highly parallelized implementation in a load generator is required. Today, modern servers for CPU-intensive tasks reserve no capacity for high load, leading to scalability bottlenecks at the data center. Assuming you're using a server that can handle high loads, you should experience faster computation times or memorized results (better as 'cached in memory').\n\nTo confirm if the computations have been influenced by the repetition of the question, you can check the raw computation time, results and memory usage for each query.\n\nFor the fourth question:\nIf [...]: $\"a\" points to a variable depending on your requirements. For this site example suppose shifting \"a\" from 5 to 5. Replace the variable name in \"*\" and calculate the new \"a\"/validate the answer.\n\nFor the last question:\n>>a★4=30\n>>Find replacement for $\"a\"\n>>(27√(2^2 - 1^2) + √(4^2 - 2^2)) / (2√(2^2 - 1^2))\n>>((6√5 + 7) / (2√3)) \n>>(11√5 + 7) / 2√3\n>>(3.5162 kmph).\n\nFAQs:\nQ1: What is the task asking?\nThe task is asking you to evaluate a simple custom operation defined using the rules given in the operation rule on the provided question.\n\nQ2: What are the specific rules given in the operation rule?\nThe operation rule contains only one rule, which is:\n  a★b=\\int_{a}^{b}2x \\, dx\nwhere a and b are integral numbers.\n\nQ3: What is the customized operation calling for?\nThe customized operation calls for evaluating a★b.\n\nQ4: What is the question asking?\nThe question is asking for the numerical result for the operation call a★4, based on the information given by a= [ your number ]. The result is obtained by integrating (x^4)/4 from x=1 to x=4.\n\n----"}

Is the answer a number, a group of numbers, or a matrix?\n\n## Here' s the Guide:\nYou're an intelligent assistant (specifically specialized in evaluating custom operations), running the binary operation to inform me about the number type of the output. \n1. A&B denotes the element-by-element power operation (A \\& B)_{ij} = A_{ij}^{B_{ij}} of matrix A and matrix B.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, the answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately. Scores:1.5points for correctly evaluating the rule;1point for correctly answering the question under the rule.\n\nAnd now the Questions to answer:\n\n1. Look at the basic multiplication of matrix A and B. Identify which items will be under the new binary operation rule. Check to see if the question specifically asks for the computation of the new binary operation.\n\n2. If the question asks to compute A&B, do so directly in accordance with the rules outlined in the rule. If not, there is no applicable binary operation to be done under the rule. In that case, the question should provide a calculation that would suffice for the current operation rules, then, the question can still be answered by means of following the rules outlined in the rule.\n\n3. Finally, double-check that the answer meets the rule. If the answer is a group of numbers, the first number may be a matrix that needs conversion to follow the rules outlined above. If the answer is a number, it should be 1 with a score of 0.\n\n4. If the question asks for A&B, it's important to understand the matrix indices. Each element of the A and/or B matrix is either a number or an array (matrix) containing only numbers within it. \n\n5. If the input matrix is sparse, it may be expected to give more numbers than the abovementioned guidance because the output of A&B is also sparse.\n\n6. Pay attention to the fact that any existing identities, or generalizations involving the operation A&B; the operation of A' and the operation B'', in addition to the custom solution provided by A&B; and the property of linear transformation, or any distributivity rule you may know before coding an answer in JavaScript are all important factors in the process of solving your problem. \n\nPlease ensure the functions are properly implemented such as element-wise multiplication, power, and any additional operations if the rule allows for them."}

Since A and B are not square matrices, we'll need to pad A and B with zeros to make them square:\n\n5                     \n0                     \n3                     \n7                     \n0                     \n1                     \n4                     \n5   \n\nBut the rule says that the element by element maximization operation applies to the matrices first, so we'll pad the B matrix with identical rows to make it square:\n\n7                          \n0                          \n8                          \n3                          \n0                          \n1                          \n4                          \n5                          \n3                         \n6                          \n3                          \n8                         \n0                          \n2                  \n2                  \n2                  \n6\n    \nThis equation represents A pad with 5 rows, and B pad with 8 rows, each row contains zeros:\n5--5--8--8\n0--0--0--0\n3--3--3--3\n0--0--0--0\n\nNow we can calculate A + B columnwise:\n\nA @ B = >\n8          9          7\n                      0\n                        7\n                      -\n7       12       4\n        13       5\n\n---\n15              8\n         21              8\n                      \n7              5\n                      \n3             -     (5)\n8                     \n3                     \n3                     \n4                     \n-                     \n-                     \n4                     \n5                     \n3                     \n4       \nThe element by element maximization operation result is matrix A + B.

A better summary or explanation of things would be helpful for people who want to understand it. can describe or summarize it briefly .\nWhen evaluating expressions involving matrices using rule A€B=2“A+3”B, several things should be noted.\n\nFirstly, you must ensure that the question only asks for a specific result involving an operation that follows the rule. The rule allows matrix addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication when the matrices have dimensions that allow the operations to be performed.\n\nSecondly, make sure that the dimensions of the two input matrices are the same. If the dimensions are not the same, then the operation can't be performed.\n\nThirdly, be very careful when multiplying single matrices, especially when one matrix has more than one row and one column. For example, matrix A has two rows and one column, and since in the rule we multiply by 2, the operation will not accord with the dimensions of the resulting matrix.\n\nFor A€B, there can be different possibilities, such as addition, multiplication, or addition followed by multiplication. In your question, A€B=2“A+3”B. Here, the result does not differ from adding A and B. So, you should write only one 'A' as shown in the final answer.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that matrix multiplication follows associative and distributive laws. For multiplication followed by addition, convert the multiplication operations to addition operations that they are multiplied by."}

Prove that the inverse class of an element is a proper subgroup.\n\nSOLUTION: Suppose that $$S$$ is a finite set and $$x \\in S$$ is an element. Let $$S^- = \\{y^+ : (x, y) \\in S \\times S^+\\}$$. Then prove that $$S^- \\setminus \\{x\\}$$ is a proper subgroup. Since there are exactly two elements in $$S$$ that are the negative of an element in $$S$$, either $$x$$ or $$x^-$$, we take $$x$$ as the anchor element.\nLet $$S^-$$ and $$S^+$$ denote the sets of positive and negative elements in $$S$$, respectively. For all $$a, b \\in S$$ we have $$b - a \\in S^+$$. (If $$a < b$$, then $$b - a \\ \\text{doesn't}\\in S$$ because $$\\le$$ is not transitive.) For all $$c \\in S$$ and $$\\a$$, $$\\b$$ we have $$(c - \\a)(b - \\b) = cb - (b - a)(-c - b) = cb - (c - b)b = cb - c^2 = 0$$ because $$c \\neq -c$$ and $$b \\neq -b$$, and so $$c - \\a, \\b \\in S^+$$. For all $$a \\in S$$ and $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'$$, we have $$\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+ - \\a'^+$$ since $$(\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+) + (\\a^+ - \\a') = 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0$$, and so $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'^+$$. The element $$\\a$$ therefore lies in\nthe left coset $$S'a = \\left \\{ab : b^+ \\in S^+ \\text{ and } a = x_1x_2 x_3\\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4 x_5x_6\\dots \\right \\} \\subseteq S$$ Thus it lies in the subgroup $$H_a = \\left \\{ab : (x_1, b) \\in \\a^-\\times S' \\text{ for some }x_2 \\in S\\right \\}$$. Without loss of generality we can assume that $$1^+ \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots }$$. Suppose that $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ is not a subgroup. Then there exist $$a, b \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ such that $$a \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod {H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}}$$. By one of De Morgan's Laws, we can rewrite this as $$(ab+ba^{-1}) \\equiv 0 \\pmod {S}$$ because $$ba^{-1} \\in S^+$$ (since $$ba^{-1}$$ is an element in $$S^-$$).\nNote that the identity element $$0~\\0$$ must also be in $$S$$ (i.e., $$0~\\0 \\in Sz$$ for some $$z \\in S$$). This means that if $$S$$ does not already reason like an Abelian group, then it must add $$0~\\0$$ to its set to make it in an Abelian group, which is the same as saying that $$S'$$ adds $$0~\\0$$ to its coset space. The additive identity of an $$(s,t)~\\times~S$$-module can be determined by the truth table of $$~\\mathbb{B}^{2}~~$$ which would determine that there is an extra added element $$0~\\0$$ which doesn't actually add a new coset space and makes the set commutative. However, using $$0~\\0$$ doesn't add an additional coset space, so on the set $$S\\times S$$ we have that the group that is commutative is the following: $(0~\\0)(2~\\0) = (2~\\0)(0~\\0) = 0~\\0$, $(1~\\0)(3~\\0) = (3~\\0)(1~\\0) = 0~\\0$. No matter what other cosets to choose, the $$0~\\0$$ isn't used and because of the addition we have to only use the $$S\\times S$$ where the $$0~\\0$$ element exists in $$S\\times S$$.\nWe still need to show that there exists a subgroup that contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ is finite. Consider the $$S\\times S$$ where $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ are added. Then the addition of the identity element in this set is just $$0~\\0$$ so it will be commutative at least. (Note that we don't know that this commutative set contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$.) Then, all that is left is to show that this set's cosets are all distinct. Counting the number of cosets in this set: Every $$0~\\0$$ element multiplied by every positive element in $$\\a^-$$ means that there is every positive integer (except 0) coset of this set. All of their cosets are distinct, so this set has a subgroup, so $$S$$ must furthermore have a subgroup.\n\n(Note: The chapter book has a much easier and more specific arguement shown in Chapter 11: Proof of the Existence of the Inverse of an Element if the set it is a member of is Finite, since we can show all of that in s subset of a size $$n(A)$$ so that criteria is met. Because we do not have the candidate modulus range $$5, 6, etc..$$ that extends $$0~\\0$$ to infinite numbers given, this argument is far easier)\n\nWe postulate that every subgroup must include at least one negative element but since there are infinitely many elements is difficult to find what number is the one in that subgroup will that prove that a finite group has a subgroup. (Induction is especially bashy) Consider the proof given by Gaussian modulos 2: We show that for $$S'$$ it must have a sufficiently large set of coset space that must add a new set of coset space for for every $$i$$ doesn't exist an element $$0~in H_i$$ such that each $$H_i$$ $$\\notin S'$$ are distinct. Thus proving that this hypothesis is true and it should include $$S$$. We consider the following paremary (but deensand were insufficient) argument. Counting the number of new cosets in $$H_i$$ every singleton element multiplied by every positive element in that singleton means that there is every positive integer (but not including 0) coset of $$a_i$$ and that the argument is different every new singleton's are distinct meaning that any singleton new set of cosets are not in S, This new set is a $$\\subset S'$$ describable as $$(x, (x'+1))_i\\bmod k$$ with $$k$$ is an set of coset elements, we cannot constrain for $$x$$ because $$x$$ is allowed to be negative and as a result we know that often no $$x$$ element is allowed but we still know that there is an infinite set of elements (which the set must not need to guarantee such a subset) to make the subset comutaative, We can define a single coset $$x$$ as $$N(x_0)=\\{a+kx_0 a= a+(ax_0) a/(a+x_0)= a+x_1(x_0+x_0^2(x_0^3+x_0^4(x_0^5+x_0^6(x_0^7+\\dots+\\binom{n}{n\\ -1}x_n+\\dots+x_1(x_0^{\\n-1})))+x_0(x_0+x_0^2(x_"}
