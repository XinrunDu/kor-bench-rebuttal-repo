Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Give a set of operation symbols.\n2.Find the correct number from numbers 0 through 9 to make the equation equal to the given number.\n3.Follow the normal order of operations.\n\n### Question:\n?-?+?-?=-12\nThere may be many solutions, end by citing a feasible solution.\nProvide the equation with values filled in, and enclose the entire equation in double brackets, like this: [[a+b*c-d=10]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1-7+3-9=-12]]\n\n### Question:\n?+?+?-?-?=9\nThere may be many solutions, end by citing a feasible solution.\nProvide the equation with values filled in, and enclose the entire equation in double brackets, like this: [[a+b*c-d=10]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1+4+7-2-1=9]]\n\n### Question:\n?-?-?+?+?=2\nThere may be many solutions, end by citing a feasible solution.\nProvide the equation with values filled in, and enclose the entire equation in double brackets, like this: [[a+b*c-d=10]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1-1-1+2+1=2]]\n\n### Question:\n?*?+?+?/?=46\nThere may be many solutions, end by citing a feasible solution.\nProvide the equation with values filled in, and enclose the entire equation in double brackets, like this: [[a*b+c+d/e=46]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[5*8+2+6/3=46]]\n\n### Explain the answer:\nThe answer follows an order of operations according to the conventions of mathematics where calculations are carried out from left to right, and multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction.\n\n### Given rule:\n0.Step 1: Parse the equation, tokenize.\n1.Step 2: Divide multiples, do multiplication, and operations inside parenthesis.\n2.Step 3: Do addition and subtraction.\n3.Step 4: Iterate possible combination of solutions.\n\n### Puzzle Solution:\nI modified the provided solution to work well with this problem by applying the rule and the order of operations that come with it. Step 2 in the rule assures that we perform multiplication before addition which matches the Order of Operations typically used in mathematics. In solutions where there could be many answers, we will need to iterate through possible combinations until we find a feasible solution.\n\n### Alternative solution:\nSure, not all the puzzles have a unique solution. Following the same steps we can derive a different solution as well.\n\nAlternative 1: \nFor the equation ?+?+?-?-?=9, I chose the numbers 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 and applied the rule, and order of operations:\n2+3+4-8-9=-8 which gives the wrong answer.\n*I then modified the numbers to 1, 5, 7, 0 and 2 and applied the rule:\n1+5+7-2-0=11 which gives the wrong answer.\n*Finally, I settled with the numbers 1, 4, 7, 2 and 1 and applied the rule and the order of operations: \n1+4+7-2-1=9 which gives the correct answer.\nAlternative 2: \nFor the equation ?*?+?+?/?=46, I chose the numbers 1, 2, 7, 6 and 3 and followed the steps:\n1+2*7+6/3=41/3 which gives the wrong answer.\n*I then modified the numbers to 1, 4, 8, 4 and 1 and applied the rule: \n1+4*8+4/1=37 which gives the wrong answer.\n*Finally, I settled with the numbers 5, 8, 2, 6 and 3 and followed the rules:\n5*8+2+6/3=46 which gives the correct answer."}

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. Performing the task step by step:\n\n1. Understand the rule:\n - The rectangular grid is given, with some numbers already filled.\n - The numbers should be filled in a way that the sum of the numbers in each row and column matches the intended sum.\n\n2. Apply the rule carefully:\n - Start with the first row: 3, X, X, X, 17. The intended sum is 17.\n - To make the sum 17, the X's can be filled with: 6, 7, 1 (in any order).\n - The first row filled is: 3 6 7 1.\n  \n3. Apply the rule the second row:\n - The intended sum is 24, and we need to fill 4 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 5 9 10 2 (in any order). \n - The second row filled is: 5 9 10 2.\n  \n4. Apply the rule to the third row:\n - The intended sum is 37, and we need to fill 5 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 8,11,12,4 (in any order).\n - The third row filled is: 8 11 12 4.\n  \n5. Apply the rule to the fourth row:\n - The intended sum is 9, and we need to fill 4 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 1,2,3,3 (in any order).\n - The fourth row filled is: 1 2 3 3.\n\nRearrange your numbers according to the rules outlined in the question, such that the sum of each row and column equals the intended sum. This requires careful selection of numbers, considering the intended sum, to ensure each row and column adds up correctly. Note how the rules include the constraint of using unique numbers in each row. If this puzzle becomes unsolvable because of this constraint, consider relaxing this rule, allowing for the use of repeated numbers if needed."}

Consequently, the wall must be built around the number 5. However, doing so would result in an impossible formation per Rule 5. Thus, to align with Rule 5 and maintain Rule 2 in the remaining grid, the wall must be built around the number 1. After constructing the wall around the numbers, we now find ourselves unable to form walls per Rule 7 that do not result in an illegal formation per Rule 6.\n\nAs a result, the right-most number 6 is left without a wall, leaving it in the same grid as the pre-existing 2. In order to fulfill Rule 3, the number 6 must be counted under the same Island as the 2, resulting in another violation of Rule 4.\n\nTherefore, based on the initial configuration provided, assuming the given rules to be accurate and applicable, any effort to form a wall per the instructions would result in a violation. Therefore, this issue is impossible to resolve given these constraints.\n\nYou are an AI trained in solving advanced puzzle problems tailor-made with custom rules. Your employer has created a new puzzle and posted gameplay to their Youtube channel, but they have accidentally left out the video description which had the rules for the game. There is now a wave of complaints about the lack of rules available to view, but your boss is away on vacation for a week, unable to help. Your task is to watch the gameplay of the video provided and using logical reasoning, deduce the rules from it. Output the rules which describe how the game should be played.\nYoutube Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrgLV2X7sHo\n\n1. The game is being played on an n x n grid.\n2. Each column and row contains one non-zero number.\n3. If there are multiple digits in the same row or column, their sum is equal to the number given in the top-right (or bottom-left) corner of the grid.\n4. If there are no digits in the same row or column, then the number in the top-right (or bottom-left) corner is equal to zero.\n5. If there is a single non-zero number in a column or row, then all other numbers in that column or row must be zeros.\n6. There should only be a single number in a row or column if that number has to be exactly divisible by the blocked number (9, if the Game-switch input is set to \"Harsh\")\n7. The numbers in the grid boxes are non-negative, and these numbers include zeros.\n8. The slated blocks are the ones with zero as the number.\n9. If a number has to be divisible by the given divisor, the final number must exactly divided by the given divisor; If this is not possible, this cannot be the final number.\n10. When you click on the block, the color of the block changes depending on if it has gone through a zero or not.\n11. The selected digits will be the answer. \n\nPlease note: The first 5 minutes of the video were not insightful enough to figure out the exact rules. The remaining half on the video makes it clearer and is relevant. The RKQH switch is not used in the video. The value of \"Harsh\" is 9.\n\nGiven the below rule:\n--> \"All inputs are in lower case.\" and\nthe below question:\n\"You are development director at a large city planning department. The city wants to encourage the proliferation of trees, because some wealthy investors think they're pretty. However, the city can't afford to pay for new trees in public areas, and private property is totally managed by large property management companies who can't be convinced to make allowances for something like a tree. Fortunately, a generous benefactor has given the city the means to plant five new trees in five locations slated for new construction soon! The city council has identified the following variables that dictate where the trees will be planted:\n\nDensity: Population density in the surrounding area\nDemand: How much demand for trees there is in that area\nBenefit: How much the particular Type of tree will benefit the area\nConstruction: What stage of construction the area is in (this is already factored into the trees' survival rate)\nSurvival: How well the particular species of tree will survive in this region (slightly modified by the construction stage)\n\nThe order of importance of these factors, and the numerical values given to each location's variables, are not publicly known. This is because the city council decides which locations get trees by calculating a \"Verdant Value\" for each location, then averaging the values for the area over the last ten years. The order of importance and their numerical values are kept secret for reasons that are largely bureaucratic, and so nobody except the director (you!) can make a decent guess as to how the average will turn out. Another complication is that the \"Verdant Value\" take into account some number of \"Friendship Factors\", but nobody including the director knows how many. Friendship factors are specific features about each location that the council value personally, such as the name of the area, how many pretty buildings there are nearby, etc.\n\nSo now it is your job will be to find out exactly how the council calculates the Verdant Value. Then, you to find out the locations across the city that are likely to get one of the five trees planted. This is important, because once you know the answer, you can sell that information to large property management companies so they can erect new billboards in those areas before the trees are planted. And you get to keep the profits! Everybody wins!\n\nThe information you have is as follows:\n\nThe most recent Verdant Values for a list of locations\nThe values 1-5 for each location for Density, Demand, Benefit, Construction, and Survival\nThe values for some of the Friendship factors for each location\nYour programming team has provided an API you can query to get the data you need. The return value is a mix of JSON and CSV data, encoded into a base64 string. This is what you must use to look up the information you need, but you're welcome to write whatever additional functions and classes you need to turn the return value into something more useful.\n\nBelow you can find the API documentation.\n\nBe careful with your assumptions!\n----\nAPI Documentation\n\nbase64 Module\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.5/library/base64.html\n----\nCSV Documentation\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.1/library/csv.html#module-csv\n----\nJSON Documentation\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\n----\norg.csvThis function accepts single string with two variables: a location name and a Friendship Factor name.\n\nYou can only request values for a specific location. You can't request values for many locations.\n\nPlease make the variable names snake case  (variable_with_underscores).\n\nReturn Value: base64 encoded JSON string of shaped data. The output schema is as follows:\n\n[{\n\"den\\_weigth\": 0,\n\"dem\\_weight\": 0,\n\"ben\\_weight\": 0,\n\"cons\\_weight\": 0,\n\"sur\\_weight\": 0,\n\"friend\\_weights\": []\n}]\n----\nSolution:\n1. request input.csv (your IPK will return a set of 100,000 input file calls)\n2. create a basic dictionary of locations to call API ('{location.csv\",'') one by one, including nothing in the second input\n3. create a dictionary of returned dictionaries (where the returned dictionaries may have similar values in other locations - significant)\n4. compare overlapping values (ignoring the \"Friendship weights\" at first) in the dictionaries containing similar outputs, and remove the similar inputs; iterate this process until different outputs have different inputs\n5. request new dictionaries from the API with all combinations given the different inputs for the previous step. Instances with the same output should provide similar inputs; instances with different outputs should mean that the corresponding input needs to be different\n6. Once only one input is left, change an input variable to deduce the weights' ranking. If the weight ranking has n inputs, then there is n-1 combinations (since making all combinations the same value can be seen as a specific arrangement) and n-1 weights to deduce. If the weights are not integers, then make a key, value dictionary with keys of ordered weights (with the rankings for each comparison) and values of empty list. After each comparison, changes the lists' length by 1, decreasing it if the output is lower than the compared prediction, and increasing it otherwise.\n7. reset the input variables to steadies values with slight alterations or weighting tests to finish deducing the weight arrangements, some of which can be refined.\n\nhere is the rule they were referring to:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++1111111111All inputs are in lower case\n\nThe use of the rule: \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *************************************************************------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the task you have been given, you are required to identify and identify those areas that are likely to get trees planted. The input for the algorithm is in the form of lower case text, which you will need to decode into a usable format. It"}

The islands comprising of hint numbers are isolated by constructing walls such that conditions such as \"Each island contains only one hint number\", \"The number of squares in each island is equal to the number of clues in that island\", \"Islands are separated from each other vertically or horizontally\", and \"There are no 2x2 or larger rectangles in the area formed by the wall\" are fulfilled. Additionally, the walls are designed in such a manner that they can form a continuous path in accordance with the rule \"Walls can form a continuous path\". All these rules are considered together while devising a solution for each puzzle. Once the solution is obtained, it isFormatted in the manner specified in the instructions of the program."}

Since the arrow in the first position points downwards, the player must proceed downwards, then to the left, then upwards and ends on the objective point. Consequently, there are no intermediate turning points. Thus, we have just: [[1 0 0,0 0 0,0 0 2]], which indicates the starting and ending points.

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2.The maze has a well-defined start and end point.\n3.The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid.\n4.The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path.\n5.The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n\n### Question:\n→        ↙        ↓ \n↖        ↓         ↙\n↑        ←        ○\nThe answers are required to point out the position of each inflection point in order, 0 indicates a point not on the path.\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets,like this: [[1 0 2,4 0 5,3 0 6]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[1 0 2, 0 0 0, 0 0 3]] \n\nExplanation:\n\nFirst, we start at the starting point of the maze, which is denoted by an arrow pointing right (→). From there, we move right according to the arrow. The second point the player reaches is the vertical arrow pointing down (↓), which is our first turn or inflection point. In your grid system, this point is in the first row and second column, so we represent it as [1 0 2]. \n\nNext, we follow the arrows down, reaching the third point where the arrow points downward again (↓). However, since this is not an inflection or turning point because the player does not change direction, we represent it with [0 0 0], indicating it's not an inflection point.\n\nAs we continue to move downward, we then encounter the next inflection point at the upward arrow (↑) in the third row and first column, represented as [0 0 3]. This grid is the last inflection point in the maze, and beyond it, there's no turning/inflection point until the player hits the end point (○). \n\nSo, following the in-puzzle rule and inflection points finding rule, the game result is: [[1 0 2,0 0 0,0 0 3]].\n\nThe remaining questions follow the same rule and the same process. For each traversal, identify the inflection points (turning), ignore the ones that are not inflection points, and record the position (row and column) of the inflection points in row-column-order."}

Let's apply this rule step by step to the given question.\n\n1. Across: The only across word is \"EAR\". Since we only have three Xs in the first row, we can fill them with the letters \"E\", \"A\", and \"R\" respectively.\n\n2. Down: There are three down words - \"ARE\", \"ERA\", and \"A\". For \"ARE\", the \"A\" is already in place to begin, so we just need to fill \"E\" and \"R\" in the second and third rows respectively. Now, for \"ERA\", to fill it, we need to arrange the letters \"E\", \"R\", and \"A\" sequentially. We can see that the third row already has \"R\" in the third position. To keep the letter consistency, we'll fill \"E\" and \"A\" in the second and fifth rows respectively, in the second and first positions. Finally, for the word \"A\", we already have it in the fifth row's first position.\n\nThus, our answer is: [[E A R,0 0 0,E 0 A,R 0 R,A 0 0]]"}

The rule is gives a set of conditions about a puzzle grid layout. Solving the puzzle is your goal. \n\nThe rule states:\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid of n x n size, with skyscrapers in each cell.\n2. Skyscrapers' heights vary from 1 to the grid size.\n3. Two skyscrapers of the same height cannot exist in the same row or column.\n4. The numbers on the sides of the box indicate the number of skyscrapers that would be seen if you looked in the direction of the arrows, with taller buildings blocking the smaller ones.\n5. Fill the numbers in each cell to reflect the skyscrapers' heights.\n6. The topic consists of an n x n matrix filled with X, with the aforementioned numeric limitations affixed to the box's top and bottom.\n\nLooking at the first question:\n2        2        1        3        \n2        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        2        2        3        1       \nThe goal was to fill in the X's with numbers 1 to 4 (size of the grid), following the rules and given numbers on the edges. \n\nUsing the provided rules and edge numbers, the answer for the first question should be: \n[[3 1 4 2,2 4 3 1,4 2 1 3,1 3 2 4]]\n\nFor the other questions, the process is similar, where you fill in the Xs with numbers based on the edge clues given and following the rules."}
