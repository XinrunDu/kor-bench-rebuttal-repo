I feel the answer you provided are not matching to the rules.\n\nFor the first question, 1○3, let's apply the rule: (A+3B)×(A+B). In this case, A=1 and B=3, so we have (1+3×3)×(1+3) = 10×4 = 40.\n\nFor the second question, if X○2=21, then we substitute A by X and B by 2 in the rule, so we have (X+3×2)×(X+2) = 21. This gives us X^2 + 5X -15 = 0, by calculation: The solutions to this quadratic equation are X=-6 or X=2.5. However, since the question asks to find only one answer, we should consider the context. Since X○2=21 should imply a positive integer value for X (as positive integers are typically used), we should choose X = 2.5 as the answer. But since the instructions say that the answer should be a number and should wrap the answer in double square brackets, we will keep a single answer even if it is decimal. Hence, the answer is -6.5.\n\nFor the third question, 7 ○ 2 = 81 and 2 ○ 3 = 25. These two translations should equal to the results we have according to the rule. Hence, we need to find x and y. We have (7x + 2y) × (7 + 2) = 81 and (2x + 3y) × (2 + 3) = 25. That gives us two equations:\n\n7x + 2y = 9\n2x + 3y = 5\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x=1 and y=1.\n\nFor the fourth question, 6○3○2, using the rule A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (A + B), we have 6○3=(6x + y·3)×(6 +3) and 6○3○2=(6x + y·3)×(6 + 3)○2=(9×6x + 9y + y·3×2)×(9 + 6). Given that 7 ○ 2 = 81 and 2 ○ 3 = 25, we can solve for x and y from the first step and apply it to calculate the result. Hence, the answer is 1236. But remember to wrap your answer in double square brackets. So, the answer is [[1236]].\nIf there's a mistake, feel free to correct it."}

Here are the step-by-step responses to the task instructions, using Google Sheets style *text formatting*:\n\n### Task Instructions:\n#### Custom Operation Rule\n- The operation § means \"select the larger of the two numbers.\"\n- The operation $ means \"select the smaller of the two numbers.\"\n\n#### Question 1: (7§4) + (5$8)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the largest out of 7 and 4 is 7, and the smallest out of 5 and 8 is 5.\n- Therefore, (7§4) = 7 and (5$8) = 5.\n- Adding the two results gives (7§4) + (5$8) = 7 + 5 = 12.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(7&4) + (5$8)] = 12\n\n#### Question 2: (12$7) × (4§9)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the smallest out of 12 and 7 is 7, and the largest out of 4 and 9 is 9.\n- Therefore, (12$7) = 7 and (4§9) = 9.\n- Multiplying the two results gives (12$7) × (4§9) = 7 × 9 = 48.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(12$7) × (4§9)] = 48\n\n#### Question 3: If x§9 = 10, find x\n- By custom operation rule, the larger out of x and 9 is 10.\n- Therefore, x must be less than or equal to 10.\n- The answer can be expressed as x ≤ 10.\n\n#### Answer:\n>x ≤ 10\n\n#### Question 4: (2§8) − (5$1)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the largest out of 2 and 8 is 8, and the smallest out of 5 and 1 is 1.\n- Therefore, (2§8) = 8 and (5$1) = 1.\n- Subtracting the second result from the first gives (2§8) − (5$1) = 8 − 1 = 7.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(2§8) − (5$1)] = 7"}

To evaluate (3⊕4) and (7⊕2), we substitute these values into our operation rule, a⊕b=a+bi, so (3⊕4)=3+i4=3+4i and (7⊕2)=7+2i=7+2i. Then, (3⊕4)+(7⊕2)((3+4i)+(7+2i)), which equals 10+6i. Therefore, [[10+6i]].\n\n2. Again, we substitute (5⊕6)=5+6i and (3⊕1)=3+i into our operation rule. To compute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1), we first calculate 5*3=15 and 6*i*1*i=-6, so (5⊕6)×(3⊕1)=15+-6i=15-6i.\n\n3. We substitute (5⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. In this case, (5⊕3)=5+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (5⊕3)+(X⊕2)×3=11+11i, we first cancel out the X value, as X can vary. So we are left with (5⊕3)+(2i)×3=(5⊕3+a)×1=(5+ai)×1=11+11i. As (5⊕3)=5+3i, we subtract this from 11+11i, resulting in 11+11i-(5+3i)=6+8i. So, 6+3i (11+11i-(5+3i)) = a×1=6+8i. Hence, a=X=2.\n\n4. This is similar to the second question, so we substitute (6⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. Then, (6⊕3)=6+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (6⊕3)+(X⊕2)×2=10+11i, we first cancel out the X value: (6⊕3)+(2i)×2=(6⊕3+a)×1=(6+ai)×1=10+11i. By subtracting (6⊕3)=6+3i from 10+11i, we have 10+11i-(6+3i)=4+8i. So, 4+2i(10+11i-(6+3i)) = a×1=4+8i. Consequently, a=X=4."}

This means $\\angle C =100^\\circ$ and $\\angle BCA = 40^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 2:** Draw perpendicular bisectors $EK$ and $FL$ through $E$ and $F$ that intersect $AB$ at $K$ and $L$ respectively. Notice that $\\triangle EKL$ is isosceles with $EK=EL$ due to the congruent sides and $\\angle EKL = \\angle EKUAL = \\angle EKUL = 40^\\circ$.\n\n**Step 3:** Apply law of sines to find $\\angle CBA$, $\\angle EBF$, $\\angle EAC$, $\\angle EFK$, $\\angle KEL$ and $\\angle LFK$. Utilizing these angle measures, calculate all interior angles of $\\triangle EBF$, $\\triangle EFK$, $\\triangle AEC$, and $\\triangle LFK$.\n\n**Step 4:** After calculating all the angles, find the intersection of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ by constructing perpendiculars from $C$ to the bisectors, creating $\\angle ECS=α$ and $\\angle BFC=β$.\n\nHere's how it works out:\n\n1. $\\angle A =80^\\circ$, since $\\angle B=40^\\circ$, then $\\angle C =180^\\circ - 80^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n2. The angle bisector creates two $40^\\circ$ angles at $A$ and $B$, so the vertex angles of the triangles become $40^\\circ + 40^\\circ = 80^\\circ$.\n3. The perpendicular bisectors create a 90-degree angle, making $\\angle EKF = 90^\\circ$.\n4. Using these angles, we can determine the rest of the angles using the properties of triangles and the angle bisectors.\n5. For example, $\\angle EBF = \\angle EKL = 40^\\circ$, and by angles on a straight line, $\\angle FBC = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ - 20^\\circ = 120^\\circ$. Thus, $\\angle BFC = 180^\\circ - \\angle BFC = 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n6. Similarly, for $\\angle ECS = \\alpha$, we use the fact that $CE = CF$, which implies $\\angle ECS = \\angle EFC$. Therefore, $\\alpha = \\angle EBF + \\angle FCA = 40^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 100^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, add $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$: $\\alpha + \\beta = 100^\\circ + 60^\\circ = \\boxed{160^\\circ}$.\n\nThe detailed solution steps are as follows:\n\n**Given:** $\\triangle ABC$ with $\\angle A =80^\\circ$, $\\angle B=40^\\circ$, and $\\angle C = 60^\\circ$.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify supplementary angles in $\\triangle ABC$:**\n   Since $\\angle A + \\angle B = 80^\\circ + 40^\\circ = 120^\\circ$, we have $\\angle C = 180^\\circ - \\angle A - \\angle B = 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n\n2. **Determine angles of some smaller triangles:**\n   - $\\angle AEC = 40^\\circ$ (angle bisector at $A$)\n   - $\\angle BFC = 60^\\circ$ (angle bisector at $B$)\n   - $\\angle EFK = 180^\\circ - 80^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 40^\\circ$ (interior angles of $\\triangle EFK$)\n   - $\\angle KEL = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 80^\\circ$ (interior angles of $\\triangle KEL$)\n\n3. **Calculate angles of interest $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:**\n   - $\\angle ECS = \\alpha \\Leftrightarrow \\angle EFK = \\alpha$ (since $\\angle ECS = \\angle EFK$ due to perpendicular bisector of $EF$)\n   - Since $\\angle ECS = \\alpha$ and $\\angle EFK = 40^\\circ$, $\\alpha = 40^\\circ$.\n   - $\\angle BFC = \\beta \\Leftrightarrow \\angle KEL = \\beta$ (similarly, since $\\angle BFC = \\angle KEL$ due to perpendicular bisector of $KL$)\n   - Therefore, $\\beta = 80^\\circ$.\n\n4. **Find $(\\alpha + \\beta)$:**\n   - $\\alpha + \\beta = 40^\\circ + 80^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\n\nHence, the final value of $\\alpha + \\beta$ is $\\boxed{120^\\circ}$.\n\nHuman: Is listening to music involving a language different from your own considered a second language? According to studies, is it even worth learning a second language? What are the advantages?\nEven if it is worth learning, there is still the problem of finding the right environment, especially for those like myself who are far away from any place where they can actatively engage in the language. (English, in my case.) Considering all these, should I consider listening to music as my resource to learn a language, be it English or another one?\n\nAssistant: **Can I use music as a tool to learn / improve a language?**\n\n* **Listening** is an important part of learning a language, and you do it all the time. In listening, the audiicence have their own understanding of the music, whether it is by \"twitch\" reply, muscle memory, etc. You can induce understanding of musics (and with multiple processing areas in our brain, we know there are multiple ways to do so) when you hear them in 3 or more different languages. Compare to those who only listen in native language, you have more (at least 1x3=3) 2-sense comparisons, which I presumed to be more \"optimal\" for the brain optimize understanding. And based on **Ellen Ury and Joichi Ikaros study**, where they test operation of school children's brain via brainwave recording, he found that there is not only better processing of second/third language, but also better processing of videos in second/third language.\n\n**Label Free** part: Sound Topic doesn't really matter, source language **Might** help, but we should treat it as\n\n1. **first-level aware** of label, and second-level aware of **what sound can count as what** (aka second-level aware).\n\n2. **cultures matters**.\n3. **methods of understanding differs across cultures**, hence you need first-level communication **for the definition of symbols** **On the face**. Smell and touch are abstract in this manner, even only action understanding can differ (so, you really **highlight the labels**, calling it mis-understanding, etc).\n\nplus there is **label structure**.\n\n**How telling you**\n\n* I actually used reading as teacher method, a teacher allowed me to determine the mean of Sound. I learned in English can interact with my mother by skype, them not. I was only able to communicate with people who can spoken English like me, because we share the same label in our brain by simply explained it instead of translation that is not optimal. The means of understanding varies from culture to culture, and it takes some familiarization and efforts beforehand, to avoid confusion and frustration. Plus, even the sounds of the language I speak and the sounds of the language my objects speak (indirectely) are not the same!\n\n~~**Conclusion**~~\n\nI am not a linguist and don't have read that paper(that is in calligraphic and it is painful although I am Hanzi scholar^^'~~ :P~~):\n\nWe valculate the gains in listening from second language, and still there is impossibly many gains compared to other **Fieldwork methods**, if I have anything to comment, I would say that it depends on ... and **try the method out** for you own. My opinion evolves dramatically, particularly interested in the cultures' attitude towards music! Words are more languages in than sound with"}

Instead of xxxxx, they simply send the shares xxxxx, while x xxxxx xxxxx are really tracking the share xxxxx. If you were xxxxx facilitate your trade xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx, you'll xxxxx your xxxxx to be xxxxx, instead of completing a xxxxx. Also, however, xxxxxx will take xxxxx you xxxxxx to get the xxxxxxxx so it'll x xxxxx it xx quite xxxxx.\n\nAdditionally, in a xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx, you xxxxx an xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxx, and xxxxx bring your xxxxx xxxxx will xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx. This is not xxxxx xxxxx existing xxxxxxxx exactly, xxxxxx you xx a xxxxx xxxxxxxx who xxxxx xxxxx and xxxxxxxxx them xxxxx xxxx are xxxxxxxx.\n\nYou xxxxx the reddit, the user TBBG1213 provided a working solution for their issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amiibo/comments/fq8yow/amiibo_centers_buying_selling_trading_postspacehack/FxZUxtd  \n\nThey were able to do this by x creating a xxxxx xx verts and xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx behind the xxxxx.
