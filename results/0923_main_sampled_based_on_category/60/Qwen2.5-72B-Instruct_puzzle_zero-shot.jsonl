Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).\n2. Different letters represent different digits.\n3. The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the equation:**\n   - SEND is a 4-digit number.\n   - MORE is a 4-digit number.\n   - MONEY is a 5-digit number.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:**\n   - SEND + MORE = MONEY\n\n3. **Assign variables:**\n   - S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y are the variables representing the digits.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y must be unique digits.\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y must be between 0 and 9.\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y cannot be 0 (since they are the first letters of multi-digit numbers).\n\n5. **Carry considerations:**\n   - The sum of two 4-digit numbers results in a 5-digit number, so there must be a carry from the thousands place.\n\n6. **Start solving:**\n   - Since the result is a 5-digit number, M must be 1.\n   - The equation now looks like: 10000 + 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 10000 + 10000 + 1000M + 100O + 10N + Y\n\n7. **Simplify the equation:**\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 10000 + 1000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 100O + 10N + 10R + D + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10R + D + E = 10000 + Y\n\n8. **Trial and error with constraints:**\n   - M = 1\n   - S + 1 + carry = 10 (since the result is a 10 in the thousands place)\n   - S + 1 = 9 (since carry is 1, S = 8)\n   - E + O + carry = 10 (E + O + 1 = 10, so E + O = 9)\n\n9. **Assign values:**\n   - S = 8\n   - M = 1\n   - E + O = 9\n   - N + R + carry = 10\n   - N + R = 9 (since carry is 1)\n   - D + E + carry = Y\n   - D + E + 1 = Y\n\n10. **Solve for E and O:**\n    - E + O = 9, possible pairs (E, O): (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1) (but 1 is already used and 8 is S, so not valid)\n\n11. **Solve for N and R:**\n    - N + R = 9, possible pairs (N, R): (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1) (but 1 and 8 are used, so not valid)\n\n12. **Final assignment:**\n    - E = 5, O = 4\n    - N = 6, R = 3\n    - D + E + 1 = Y\n    - D + 5 + 1 = Y\n    - D + 6 = Y\n    - D = 7, Y = 2\n\n13. **Verify:**\n    - SEND = 9567\n    - MORE = 1085\n    - 9567 + 1085 = 10652\n\nThus, the solution is:\n[[S=9,E=5,N=6,D=7,M=1,O=0,R=8,Y=2]]"}

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the equation:**\n   - TO represents a two-digit number.\n   - GO represents a two-digit number.\n   - OUT represents a three-digit number.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Different letters cannot represent the same number.\n   - The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0 (i.e., T, G, and O).\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - TO + GO = OUT\n   - Let T = a, O = b, G = c, U = d, and the equation becomes:\n     - 10a + b + 10c + b = 100d + 10a + b\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     - 10a + b + 10c + b = 100d + 10a + b\n     - 10a + 2b + 10c = 100d + 10a + b\n     - 2b + 10c = 100d + b\n     - b + 10c = 100d\n\n4. **Analyze the equation:**\n   - Since b + 10c = 100d, the left side (b + 10c) must be a multiple of 100.\n   - The only way this can happen is if b = 0 and 10c = 100d, which simplifies to c = 10d.\n   - However, since c and d are digits (0-9), the only possible solution is c = 9 and d = 1 (as 10c must be a multiple of 100 and d must be a digit).\n\n5. **Substitute c and d back into the equation:**\n   - b + 10c = 100d\n   - b + 10(9) = 100(1)\n   - b + 90 = 100\n   - b = 10\n\n6. **Check the values:**\n   - b = 0 (since b must be a digit and the only valid value that fits the equation).\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the possible values:**\n   - T, O, G, U must be digits, and O cannot be 0.\n   - Try different combinations to satisfy the equation.\n\n8. **Test possible values:**\n   - Let's try T = 1, O = 2, G = 7, U = 9:\n     - TO = 12, GO = 72, OUT = 84\n     - 12 + 72 = 84 (which is correct).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n[[T=1, O=2, G=7, U=8]]"}

Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each letter represents a unique digit.\n   - The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n   - The equation must balance: ONE + ONE + TWO = FOUR.\n\n2. **Analyze the equation:**\n   - Since we are adding two ONEs and one TWO, the sum must be a four-digit number (FOUR).\n\n3. **Start with the most significant digits:**\n   - The letter 'F' must be 1 because the sum of three numbers (ONE + ONE + TWO) cannot exceed 2997 (999 + 999 + 999), and the only way to get a four-digit number starting with 1 is if F = 1.\n\n4. **Determine the carry-over:**\n   - Since F = 1, there must be a carry-over from the hundreds place. This means that the sum of the hundreds place (O + O + T) plus any carry-over from the tens place must be at least 10.\n\n5. **Assign values to O and T:**\n   - Let's assume O = 5 (a common starting point for trial and error). Then 5 + 5 + T must be at least 10.\n   - 5 + 5 + T = 10 + carry-over from the tens place. This implies T = 0 (since 5 + 5 + 0 = 10).\n\n6. **Check the tens place:**\n   - The tens place equation is N + N + W + carry-over from the units place. Since O + O + T = 10, the carry-over to the tens place is 1.\n   - Therefore, N + N + W + 1 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the hundreds place carry-over), results in a number where the tens digit is 4 (since the hundreds digit of FOUR is 0).\n\n7. **Assign values to N and W:**\n   - Let's try N = 6. Then 6 + 6 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24 (since the carry-over to the hundreds place is 1).\n   - 6 + 6 + W + 1 = 13 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0 (since T is already 0).\n   - Let's try N = 7. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24.\n   - 7 + 7 + W + 1 = 15 implies W = 7, but N and W cannot be the same.\n   - Let's try N = 8. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 15.\n   - 8 + 8 + W + 1 = 17 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0.\n   - Let's try N = 9. Then 9 + 9 + W + 1 must be 19 or 29.\n   - 9 + 9 + W + 1 = 19 implies W = 1, but F is already 1.\n\n8. **Check the units place:**\n   - The units place equation is E + E + O + carry-over from the units place. Since O = 5, E + E + 5 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the tens place carry-over), results in a number where the units digit is 4 (since the units digit of FOUR is 4).\n   - 2E + 5 + 1 = 10 + 4 implies 2E + 6 = 10 + 4.\n   - 2E + 6 = 14 implies 2E = 8 implies E = 4.\n\n9. **Verify the solution:**\n   - ONE = 594\n   - ONE + ONE = 594 + 594 = 1188\n   - TWO = 085\n   - 1188 + 085 = 1273\n\nThe solution is:\n[[O=5, N=9, E=4, T=0, W=8, F=1, U=2, R=3]]"}

The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nLet's denote the pounds lost by each dieter as follows:\n- Sugar-free diet: \\( S \\)\n- Caveman diet: \\( C \\)\n- Gluten-free diet: \\( G \\)\n\nFrom clue 1: \\( S = C + 4 \\)\n\nFrom clue 2: Mandy used the sugar-free diet, so \\( S = Mandy \\).\n\nFrom clue 3: The friend who used the caveman diet lost more pounds than Eula. So, \\( C > Eula \\).\n\nFrom clue 4: Eula is either on the gluten-free diet or the caveman diet. Since \\( C > Eula \\), Eula cannot be on the caveman diet. Therefore, Eula must be on the gluten-free diet. So, \\( G = Eula \\).\n\nFrom clue 5: Barbara lost 7 lbs. So, \\( B = Barbara \\).\n\nNow we have:\n- Mandy on the sugar-free diet: \\( S = Mandy \\)\n- Eula on the gluten-free diet: \\( G = Eula \\)\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs: \\( B = 7 \\)\n\nSince \\( S = C + 4 \\) and Barbara lost 7 lbs, we need to determine the values of \\( S \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nPossible values for \\( C \\) (since \\( C \\) must be less than 7):\n- If \\( C = 3 \\), then \\( S = 3 + 4 = 7 \\). This would mean both Mandy and Barbara lost 7 lbs, which is not possible since each person lost a different amount.\n- If \\( C = 5 \\), then \\( S = 5 + 4 = 9 \\). This fits the condition.\n\nSo, \\( C = 5 \\) and \\( S = 9 \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine who lost 3 and 5 pounds:\n- Eula lost \\( G \\) pounds, and since \\( C > Eula \\), Eula must have lost 3 pounds.\n- The person who lost 5 pounds is on the caveman diet, and since Eula is not on the caveman diet, the person who lost 5 pounds must be the remaining dieter, which is Barbara.\n\nThus:\n- Mandy lost 9 pounds on the sugar-free diet.\n- Barbara lost 7 pounds (this was given).\n- The person who lost 5 pounds is on the caveman diet (since \\( C = 5 \\)), and this must be the remaining dieter, who is not Eula or Mandy, so it must be the third person.\n- Eula lost 3 pounds on the gluten-free diet.\n\nThe final arrangement in the required format is:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 Barbara Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]] \n\nHowever, since Barbara appears twice, we need to correct this.

The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch.\n5. #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Fourth Place:**\n   - The bird that finished fourth was #118.\n   - So, the fourth place is occupied by #118.\n\n2. **Relative Placement of #126 and Kermit:**\n   - #126 finished 1 place after Kermit.\n   - This means Kermit finished in a position one place before #126.\n\n3. **Third Place:**\n   - The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch.\n   - Since #126 finished after Kermit, and Kermit cannot be in the third place (because #126 would then be in the fourth place, which is already occupied by #118), Stretch must be the one who finished third.\n   - Therefore, the third place is occupied by Stretch.\n\n4. **#134 and Ozzy:**\n   - #134 was either Ozzy or the ostrich that finished third.\n   - Since Stretch is the ostrich that finished third, #134 must be Ozzy.\n   - So, Ozzy is #134.\n\n5. **Placement of Ozzy and #120:**\n   - #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.\n   - Since Ozzy is #134, #120 must be in a position after #134.\n   - Given the positions already filled:\n     - Third: Stretch\n     - Fourth: #118\n   - Ozzy (#134) must be in either the first or second place.\n   - #120 must be in the remaining position (either first or second, but after Ozzy).\n\n6. **Placement of #126:**\n   - #126 finished one place after Kermit.\n   - Since Stretch is in the third place and #118 is in the fourth place, #126 cannot be in the third or fourth place.\n   - Therefore, #126 must be in the second place, and Kermit must be in the first place.\n\n### Final Placement:\n- First place: Kermit\n- Second place: #126\n- Third place: Stretch\n- Fourth place: #118\n\n### Verifying:\n- #118 is in the fourth place.\n- #126 is one place after Kermit.\n- Stretch is in the third place.\n- #134 is Ozzy.\n- #120 is after Ozzy, which must be in the first place.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[first Kermit #134, second #126 #126, third Stretch #126, fourth #118 #118]] \n\nHowever, there is a slight inconsistency in the format. The correct format should be:\n\n[[first Kermit #134, second #126 #126, third Stretch #126, fourth #118 #118]]\n\nBut since Stretch is the ostrich and the numbers should be consistent, the correct answer should be:\n\n[[first Kermit #134, second #126, third Stretch, fourth #118]]\n\nHowever, to match the exact required format:\n\n[[first Kermit #134, second #126 #126, third Stretch #126, fourth #118 #118]]\n\nThis is the final answer, ensuring all conditions are met."}

Let's break down the clues and find the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Clues Analysis:\n1. **Vicki's client, Beulah, and the client who paid $150 were all different clients.**\n   - This means that Vicki's client is not Beulah, and neither is the client who paid $150.\n2. **Misty's client was either Eula or Inez.**\n   - This narrows down Misty's client to Eula or Inez.\n3. **Nancy's client paid more than Kara's client.**\n   - This implies that the price of Nancy's client is greater than the price of Kara's client.\n4. **Debra paid 10 dollars less than Inez.**\n   - This means if Inez paid \\( x \\) dollars, Debra paid \\( x - 10 \\) dollars.\n5. **Debra paid 20 dollars less than Misty's client.**\n   - This means if Misty's client paid \\( y \\) dollars, Debra paid \\( y - 20 \\) dollars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Identify the possible prices and clients:**\n   - Prices: $150, $160, $170, $180\n   - Clients: Beulah, Eula, Inez, Debra\n   - Masseuses: Vicki, Misty, Nancy, Kara\n\n2. **Determine Misty's client:**\n   - From Clue 2, Misty's client is either Eula or Inez.\n   - From Clue 5, Debra paid 20 dollars less than Misty's client.\n   - From Clue 4, Debra paid 10 dollars less than Inez.\n\n   Let's test the two possibilities:\n   - If Misty's client is Eula:\n     - Debra paid \\( Eula - 20 \\).\n     - If Eula paid $170, Debra paid $150.\n     - If Eula paid $180, Debra paid $160.\n   - If Misty's client is Inez:\n     - Debra paid \\( Inez - 20 \\).\n     - If Inez paid $170, Debra paid $150.\n     - If Inez paid $180, Debra paid $160.\n\n   Since Debra paid $10 less than Inez, and we need to find a consistent pair:\n   - If Inez paid $180, Debra paid $170. This is not possible because Debra cannot pay $10 more than Inez.\n   - If Inez paid $170, Debra paid $160. This is not possible because Debra cannot pay $10 more than Inez.\n   - If Inez paid $160, Debra paid $150. This is consistent.\n\n   Therefore, Misty's client is Inez, and Debra paid $150.\n\n3. **Determine the remaining prices and clients:**\n   - Debra paid $150.\n   - Inez paid $160.\n   - Eula must be Misty's client, and she paid $160.\n   - The remaining prices are $170 and $180.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining prices to clients:**\n   - From Clue 3, Nancy's client paid more than Kara's client.\n   - The remaining prices are $170 and $180.\n   - Therefore, Nancy's client must have paid $180, and Kara's client must have paid $170.\n\n5. **Identify the clients for each masseuse:**\n   - Debra paid $150, and she cannot be Misty's client (Inez).\n   - Beulah is not Vicki's client (Clue 1), so Beulah must be Kara's client.\n   - Since Beulah paid $170 and Kara's client paid $170, Beulah is Kara's client.\n   - Eula is Misty's client and paid $160.\n   - The remaining client is Inez, who is Misty's client and paid $160.\n   - The remaining client is Debra, who paid $150.\n\n6. **Assign the remaining client:**\n   - Eula is Misty's client and paid $160.\n   - Inez is Misty's client and paid $170.\n   - Debra paid $150 and is not Misty's client.\n   - Beulah is Kara's client and paid $170.\n\n7. **Final Assignment:**\n   - $150: Debra, Kara\n   - $160: Eula, Misty\n   - $170: Inez, Nancy\n   - $180: Beulah, Vicki\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[150 Debra Kara, 160 Eula Misty, 170 Inez Nancy, 180 Beulah Vicki]]"}

Since Green & Hayes is not mentioned in the puzzle, we assume it refers to a hypothetical hire or another company not part of the puzzle. However, we can infer that the \"Green & Hayes hire\" is not relevant to the puzzle and we should focus on the dates mentioned.\n\n3. **Determine the Specific Dates:**\n   - If Rosalie was hired 3 days after someone, and the possible dates are March 18th and March 21st, then the only logical match is:\n     - Rosalie was hired on March 21st (3 days after March 18th).\n     - Therefore, Cynthia was hired on March 18th.\n\n4. **Assign Dates to Nadine and Velez & York:**\n   - The remaining dates are March 12th and March 15th.\n   - Since Nadine was hired by Velez & York, and neither of these dates have been assigned yet, we can assign them to these dates. The order does not matter for these two, but we will assign them in the order provided in the question (12th, 15th, 18th, 21st).\n\n5. **Final Arrangement:**\n   - March 12th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 15th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 18th: Cynthia Haynes Inc.\n   - March 21st: Rosalie Haynes Inc.\n\nHowever, since we have two entries for Nadine and Velez & York, we need to differentiate them. Since the exact dates for Nadine are not specified, we can choose any two remaining dates for her:\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[12 Nadine Velez & York, 15 Nadine Velez & York, 18 Cynthia Haynes Inc., 21 Rosalie Haynes Inc.]]"}

This means one person ordered both the dragon roll and the teriyaki roll.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - This means Hector either paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - The customer who ordered the tiger roll either paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n\n3. **Clue 3**: Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - This means Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.\n   - This means Virginia can only be associated with the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n   - This means the person who ordered the dragon roll is neither Virginia nor Ramona.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.\n   - Since the person who ordered the dragon roll ordered the teriyaki roll, Hector cannot be the person who ordered the dragon roll or the teriyaki roll.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - This means the firecracker roll is associated with the $9.50 price.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction:\n\n1. **Dragon Roll and Teriyaki Roll**:\n   - The person who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll.\n   - Hector cannot be this person (Clue 6).\n\n2. **Futomaki Roll and $11.50**:\n   - From Clue 2, either Hector paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - Since the dragon roll person cannot be Hector, Hector must be the one who paid $11.50 (because the dragon roll person is not Hector and the dragon roll person ordered the teriyaki roll).\n   - Therefore, the person who ordered the futomaki roll is the one who ordered the tiger roll.\n\n3. **Virginia and Ramona**:\n   - From Clue 3, one of Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - Virginia cannot be the person who ordered the dragon roll (Clue 5).\n   - Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the spider roll (Clue 4).\n   - If Virginia ordered the rainbow roll, Ramona paid $15.50.\n   - If Virginia paid $15.50, Ramona ordered the rainbow roll.\n\n4. **Firecracker Roll and $9.50**:\n   - The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n\n5. **Combining the Information**:\n   - The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - Hector paid $11.50.\n   - Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - The person who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll and is neither Virginia nor Ramona.\n   - The person who ordered the futomaki roll is the one who ordered the tiger roll.\n\n### Final Arrangement:\n- $9.50: Firecracker Roll\n- $11.50: Hector (Futomaki Roll or Tiger Roll)\n- $13.50: Dragon Roll (also ordered Teriyaki Roll)\n- $15.50: Virginia or Ramona (Rainbow Roll)\n\nGiven the constraints, we can deduce:\n- Virginia ordered the spider roll (since she cannot be the dragon roll person and must be the spider roll or rainbow roll).\n- Ramona paid $15.50 and ordered the rainbow roll.\n- The dragon roll person ordered the teriyaki roll and paid $13.50 (since the dragon roll person is neither Hector, Virginia, nor Ramona).\n- Hector paid $11.50 and ordered the futomaki roll (since he cannot be the teriyaki roll person).\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[9.50 firecracker spider John, 11.50 futomaki tiger Hector, 13.50 dragon teriyaki Sarah, 15.50 rainbow Virginia Ramona]]"}

Let's try 5, 7, 11 (4 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 27).\n   - Check if these fit the column sums:\n     - Column 1: 1 + 5 = 6\n     - Column 2: 2 + 7 = 9\n     - Column 3: 3 + 11 = 14\n     - Column 4: 8 + 5 = 13\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - We need three numbers that sum to 32 (41 - 9 = 32). Let's try 10, 12, 10 (9 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 41).\n   - Check if these fit the column sums:\n     - Column 1: 1 + 5 + 10 = 16\n     - Column 2: 2 + 7 + 10 = 19\n     - Column 3: 3 + 11 + 12 = 26\n     - Column 4: 8 + 5 + 10 = 23\n\n4. **Row 4**:\n   - We need four numbers that sum to 54. Let's try 6, 18, 13, 17 (6 + 18 + 13 + 17 = 54).\n   - Check if these fit the column sums:\n     - Column 1: 1 + 5 + 10 + 6 = 22\n     - Column 2: 2 + 7 + 10 + 18 = 37\n     - Column 3: 3 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 39\n     - Column 4: 8 + 5 + 10 + 17 = 40\n\nWe need to adjust the numbers to fit the exact column sums.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and their positions.**\n2. **Analyze each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to find missing numbers.**\n3. **Use logical deduction to fill in the blanks.**\n4. **Verify the solution against the Sudoku rules.**\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Setup\nGiven puzzle:\n```\n2 X X 7 5 X X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X X\nX X X 3 X 4 X X X\n5 2 X X X 6 4 X X\nX 4 X X 3 X X 5 X\nX X X X X 8 9 X 6\nX X 4 X X X 2 X X\nX X 7 X X X X 9 X\n9 5 X X X X 6 7 3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Puzzle\nWe'll go through each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to fill in the missing numbers.\n\n#### Row 1\n- 2 X X 7 5 X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 7, 5, 3, 4. So, the missing numbers in this subgrid are 1, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5, 7. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n\nBy logical deduction, we can place numbers in the first row:\n- 2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n\n#### Row 2\n- X X 5 X X X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 1, 9, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 4. So, the missing number is 1 (but already used in the subgrid).\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5, 6, 8, 4. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 9.\n\nBy logical deduction, we can place numbers in the second row:\n- 6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4\n\n#### Continue this process for all rows.\n\n### Final Solution\nAfter solving the puzzle, the final grid looks like this:\n\n```\n2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4\n4 7 3 3 8 4 1 9 2\n5 2 1 8 7 6 4 3 9\n7 4 6 2 3 9 8 5 1\n3 9 8 4 6 1 2 7 5\n1 6 4 5 2 7 3 4 8\n8 3 7 6 4 5 9 9 2\n9 5 2 1 9 8 6 7 3\n```\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the final row. Let's correct it:\n\n### Corrected Final Solution\n```\n2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4\n4 7 3 3 8 4 1 9 2\n5 2 1 8 7 6 4 3 9\n7 4 6 2 3 9 8 5 1\n3 9 8 4 6 1 2 7 5\n1 6 4 5 2 7 3 9 8\n8 3 7 6 4 5 1 9 2\n9 5 2 1 9 8 6 7 3\n```\n\n### Final Output\n```\n[[2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4,6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4,4 7 3 3 8 4 1 9 2,5 2 1 8 7 6 4 3 9,7 4 6 2 3 9 8 5 1,3 9 8 4 6 1 2 7 5,1 6 4 5 2 7 3 9 8,8 3 7 6 4 5 1 9 2,9 5 2 1 9 8 6 7 3]]\n```\n\nHowever, there is still a mistake in the third row and the ninth row.

Since 3,1 is already used, we use (3,1).\n   - From (4,4)(5,4):3÷, possible pairs are (1,3), (3,1). We use (3,1) again, but since it's already used, we use (1,3).\n   - From (6,1)(6,2):3÷, possible pairs are (1,3), (3,1). We use (3,1) again, but since it's already used, we use (1,3).\n   - From (1,4)(1,5):8+, possible pairs are (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2). We use (3,5) and (5,3).\n   - From (4,6)(5,6):8+, possible pairs are (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Visibility Numbers:**\n   - Top row: 1, 2, 3, 2\n   - Bottom row: 3, 2, 1, 2\n   - Left column: 1, 2, 2, 2\n   - Right column: 4, 1, 3, 2\n\n2. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - We need to place numbers 1 to 4 in each row and each column without repetition.\n   - The numbers on the sides indicate how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction.\n\n3. **Start with the Most Constraining Clues:**\n   - The number 4 on the right side of the first column means that all four skyscrapers are visible when looking from the right. This implies that the skyscrapers must be in ascending order from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - The number 1 on the left side of the second column means that only one skyscraper is visible when looking from the left. This implies that the tallest skyscraper (4) must be on the left side of this column.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - From the right side, the sequence must be 1, 2, 3, 4.\n     - From the left side, the sequence must be 4, 3, 2, 1.\n     - The sequence that satisfies both is 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - From the right side, 1 skyscraper is visible, so the tallest skyscraper (4) must be on the right.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 3, 2, 4, 1 or 2, 3, 4, 1.\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - From the right side, 3 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must be in descending order from right to left.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 4, 3, 2, 1.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - From the right side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must be in descending order from right to left.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n5. **Verify and Adjust:**\n   - Ensure that all rows and columns have unique numbers from 1 to 4.\n   - Check the visibility constraints from all sides.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter verifying and adjusting, the correct placement of skyscrapers is:\n\n```\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 4 2\n```\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n[[1 2 3 4, 4 3 2 1, 2 4 1 3, 3 1 4 2]]"}

Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 5x5 grid with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction. Here’s how to approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 through 5.\n   - The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate the number of visible skyscrapers from that direction.\n\n2. **Analyze the clues:**\n   - Top: 2, 2, 3, 2, 1\n   - Bottom: 2, 3, 1, 2, 3\n   - Left: 2, 4, 2, 1, 2\n   - Right: 1, 2, 2, 5, 3\n\n3. **Start filling the grid:**\n   - **Row 5:** The clue on the right is 5, which means all 5 skyscrapers are visible. This can only happen if the heights are in ascending order from left to right. Therefore, Row 5 must be: 1 2 3 4 5.\n   - **Row 5:** The clue on the top is 1, which means the tallest skyscraper is on the left. This is consistent with our previous fill.\n\n4. **Continue with the other rows and columns:**\n   - **Column 5:** The clue on the right for Row 1, 2, and 3 is 1, which means the tallest skyscraper is on the right. Therefore, the rightmost column must have the tallest skyscrapers in Rows 1, 2, and 3.\n   - **Row 1:** The clue on the left is 2, which means the first two skyscrapers are visible. The tallest skyscraper cannot be in the first position. Place 4 and 5 in the first two positions.\n\n5. **Fill the remaining cells:**\n   - Use the clues and the process of elimination to fill the remaining cells.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Row 5:**\n   - 1 2 3 4 5\n\n2. **Column 5:**\n   - 5\n   - 4\n   - 3\n   - 2\n   - 1\n\n3. **Row 1:**\n   - 3 4 5 1 2\n\n4. **Row 2:**\n   - 4 1 2 5 3\n\n5. **Row 3:**\n   - 2 5 1 3 4\n\n6. **Row 4:**\n   - 5 3 4 2 1\n\n7. **Row 1:**\n   - 2 3 4 1 5\n\n8. **Final grid:**\n   - 2 3 4 1 5\n   - 4 1 2 5 3\n   - 2 5 1 3 4\n   - 5 3 4 2 1\n   - 1 2 3 4 5\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[2 3 4 1 5, 4 1 2 5 3, 2 5 1 3 4, 5 3 4 2 1, 1 2 3 4 5]]"}
