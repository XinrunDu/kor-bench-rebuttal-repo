Since the average of any set of even numbers is always an integer, this operation never makes sense. For example, A(1, 5) is \"stuck\" at 2, A(1, 9) is \"stuck\" at 6, and A(2, 8) is stuck at 10.\n\n#F\n[[1]]\nIn F, the final number of the sequence is the first number in the range.\n\n#g\n4\nUnfortunately, 3/2 won't give a whole number in this case. Instead, we can get the answer the following rule: (3+1)/3*2. We can also break the final number (4) into (2*2), (2+2).\n\n#h\n4\nFor h, the result is a bit strange too.

Therefore, X = 1.\n\nSo, X in the equation X¥2 = 1 is 1.\n####\nThe answer is 17."}
