Your goal is to apply the rule accurately and present the output as required.\n\nThe first task is to complete the variable/value pair based on the given rule, which is to add a common prefix in front of the provided letter combinations and make it a word. The input for this task is \"arti un\", and the output should be formed by adding the prefix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe second task is similar, where you need to add a common suffix in front of the given letter combinations and form a word. The input for this task \"bicy\", and the output should be formed by adding the suffix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe rule is the same, except the task is now to remove a common prefix from the input words and make a word. This means you will have to figure out which letter combination serves as the common prefix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe fourth task is to remove a common suffix. Similar to the previous task, you will need to determine which letter combination serves as the common suffix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe final task is to swap the first letter of the input words with their third letter. This means you will need to identify which letter is the first letter and which letter is the third letter, and then manipulate the word accordingly.\n\nFor the rules, I've provided example letter combinations involving prefixes and suffixes, so you can see what the expected output should look like and how to apply the rule accurately. For the inputs, you will need to identify the word that represents the common prefix or suffix and apply the rule accordingly. For the \"ring\", you will need to apply the rule by manipulating the accent, which is the second letter, to match the position of the first letter in the given word.\n\nRemember, accurate application of the rule is essential for solving these problems. If you need any more guidance, let me know. I hope this helps!"}

In fact this helps in giving feedback.\nAlphabet is combined with named terms, in a required form\n(that's why generators should be banned). Characters are combined\nin an expanded form, including adding letters showwhatinside A=ABC\n\nThe following automatic text-variable is adopted -{text}-. For a better\nunderstanding, look at the template sections, marked with:\n# Nested Template Sections\n\n### Tool Template\n\nYour task is to apply this rule to the provided question.\nPass an English sentence, i.e. command, not a list of letters\nor a symbol, that should associated to the code word. Since you don't like this kind of answers through, another helpful tool is a comment\nline at the begging. Text.E reset the text-variable -{text}-.\nExample Answer format: letting user choose between resurgence and chorl with\nauto-comment that_ resurges by default, to_ ensure cleaner_ output; I should\nnot have plowed through this, Q: [{#3pl1034-Q1_V1,Q2_V1,Q3}]; A: [{#plede,zyleR1korhtq1,tame resurgence,Korht UBOAZL1P}].\nThere are several tools for depending (or changing of) letters and variables.\nThe original, with all parts described: -{resurgence,chorl,auto}-_ -{Eric,Patrick,Homer}-.\n\n\n## 2018/09/23 (Unordered List)\n\n• This syntax:\n  open a list, terminating with a or a comma\n• [#2pl1124-Q1H-C2,#2pl1124-Q2H-C1,#2pl1124-Q3M-C2]\n• shuld give the following solution:\n  + [{#bleedy66-Q12I,#able66-Q12M,#bleedy66-Q12J},#bleedy66,#able66-J-C1C6,#bleedy66-J-C1C6]\n+ [{#bleedy66-J1,#bleedy66-J2,#bleedy66-J3},#bleedy66-D-C1C6,#bleedy66-I-C1C6,#bleedy66-M-C1C6]\n• you notice that commas after a list doesn't affect output\n\n### Syntactic Supplement\n\nMulti-word double code words can be supplied in the text, separated by\nspace. We use {{x}} as a word separator. For example,\n\"I am already done {{with}} this {{kind of answers}}\" can be used in the\ntemplate entry.\nAnother feature is lists of captures. By default, it's unbolded shown as\na bullet. However, it's blue printed for a particular query (-{Q3T}\nrequested II).\n\nAll templates consist of:\n• 2: arbitrary match\n• 3: unused but existing arrow\n• 4_N: unused vowel or consonant but existing more than once\n• I.e.: I, L and U appear in all templates\n• 1. single wildcard, four construction steps (ascn bass rst bcha)\n• 2. letter, wildcard in any place and single wildcard in any place, move to begin and loop\n• 3. construction apply for all question words if done only one\n• 4 redirection via a single wildcard\n• 5: second question word\n• 6: wildcard in any position\n• 11. join next two constructs\n\n#### Special Conditions\n\n• SELECT joins two constructs with consecutive single wildcards found:\n  cons(ab/sCDe) - sta(aeh/bC)\n  trans(abCcd/e) - cons(bcd/iC/S%)\n• MULTI-CONDITIONS are when at least par substitutions are possible:\n  cons(abcd/abC/Sd) - sta(abD/aCe)\n  trans(Bcd/efA) - ... - sta(ae)/sta(dC)\n\n### Changed\n\nAutomatic warns (tie) was added and there \"texthasn\" list: opera,tau,tau1,tau2,tau1tdtjx,tau2tdtjx,tlazzrvir,zeoundrewsu,ziru,ziru1,zrur,ziru2,ziru3\n\nand now the last Q12 is set to variable event_, and chonging  altk_wkdh_ for M1mo^0mta^\n\n### Name\n\ntext is /texthasn/ which describes video conferencing\nand M1 gives you a choice of translation between matches. Keep variables in\nmind.\n\n# Commands\n\nThis template solves multiple named questions. Inside the standard answer a\nbracket-enclosed list of collapsible, numbered, algorithmically selected\nexpressions is required. The symbol '-{^}' indicates a special marker not\nseen elsewhere, equal to an arc-filled triangle from Geometry.\n\nObviously, nested algorithms can increase the answer and themselves use the\nnamed terms. Each occurrence requires obviously only / run in-line copy and\npaste / syntax.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe following example works with the first predicate flag '-{P1}' selected\nby a question number. Comparing -{hzrngreigrnqwrtitergtdgrtm1} with the\nfirst named predicate '-{P1}', the last word '-{^}' becomes [] and the outer\ntridiagonal, enclosed by a set of square comers ('{'/'}'). When using\nnamed predicate '-{P2}', arguments in brackets, '-({3})', appear inside, and\nthe word '-{^}' is replaced with the word '-{bunt1hnfrbmb}' before the outer\nenclosures (text enclosed by an arc character is removed). The example has a\npossible choice of outputs defined by the following questions:\n 1. How many.\n2. What?\n3. The table?\n\n 1.  Would you like any cake?\n   > False\n 2.  What is your favorite plant?\n   > {'beet'}\n 3.  What your favorite color?\n   > {'red'}\n 2.\n\n### Windows Categories\n\nNested Update\nSelect: 'Zrc1W1IwUbItrUr\"\nQuery: 'vzGzablgCotrUtvr'\nDelete: 'zrcv1utOtpakU"}

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\""}

It asks you to provide the explicit values of each letter in the sequence \"HI + LO = MID\" using the rule that no two letters can represent the same number.\n\nTo solve this question accurately, we apply the provided rule to the given question. We start by assigning a unique number from 0-9 to each letter in the sequence, ensuring that different letters do not represent the same number. We then combine the values of \"HI\" and subtract the value of \"LO\" from the value of \"MID.\" This gives us an equation of 7+8-3=5, which confirms that the application of the rule to the question is correct.\n\nOverall, the answer is accurate in connecting the rule to the question and ensuring that the letter-number values adhere to the given rule.\n\nThe question leaves a green checkmark (check here) next to the provided answer and a comment agreeing with it. Although the question and answer are technically grammatically correct, they lack context and clarity necessary for comprehensibility.

You buy, they deliver. They are exporting their products all over the US, and just received an order for 8,500 ceiling fans. Your manufacturing process is brought to you by jumbo pylons with date codes stamped in the center. WS is Wednesday, September 1, The manufacturing facility must work for 4 days and then has 3 days off before shipping to other factories located in Seattle, WA.\n\nQ. How many ceiling fans must the manufacturing facility produce each day for two straight weeks to fulfill the 8,500 ceiling fan order in time.\n\n\n....,W,T,,,,.?(?(?(?(?(eg, 245+247+206+??)\nThere may be different ways to find the feasible solution, and then quote your feasible solution.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nShort answer: ?=438 ceiling fans, quoting the solution 245+247+206+438=936 ceiling fans produced in 2 weeks time.\n\nLong answer: The first step is to count the number of days received by the factory. There are a total of 22 days supplied in the question since the factory gets 4 days to produce and 3 days off. It will multiply the number of ceiling fans to be made by 22 days of operation to estimate the maximum number of ceiling fans that can be distributed to satisfy this goal. Then, also, since the firm has been working for 4 days to produce and received 3 days of rest, the average number of ceiling fans made in each day will be four divided by 3 days, approximately 1.67 ceiling fans. To obtain this result, divide 22 days and 4 days of operation, resulting in 5.5 ceiling fans working every day. Multiply by 5.5, which evaluates the 5.5 ceiling fans multiplied by 10 ceiling fans to arrive at the 55 total ceiling fans in a day. Multiply the 55 ceiling fans by the day, which equates to 55 ceiling fans of 5 days of operation.\n\nSubtract the 5 ceiling operation from 22 ceiling fans,\nthe number of ceiling fans required in a day is 17 ceiling fans.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ceiling fans the factory develops each day will be 17 ceiling fans, and the total needed of ceiling fans will be 17 ceiling fans multiplied by the number of days. As a result, it will be possible to produce 17 ceiling fans every day for 22 days."}

Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"Here's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nI am an intelligent assistant created by GPT - 3. I assist with solving custom puzzle problems. To solve a custom puzzle, input the instructions, the question, the puzzle number, and answer number (optional). The puzzle and instructions correspond to each other, and the instructions will be auto-filled in most cases. Here is your puzzle:The puzzle is a top-down design approach that is used on many computer interfaces. In this approach, the user interface is laid out starting from the top of the screen and working downward. This makes sense because people usually scroll downward. This approach makes sense for many types of problems, but it might not be the best approach for a puzzle.\nSometimes we can make mistakes when we think we have answered the question correctly, but we actually don't have.\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle:\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nThe first term, 160, stands for the jars of pickles in the pantry. The second term, 80, stands for jars of mustard in the pantry. The third term, 620, is the total number of jars in the pantry. If you look closely, you'll notice that the answer is not 160 + 80 = 160 + 80 = 200. It is 160 + 80 - 160 = 80. The key to solving this puzzle is to remember to subtract 160 from 80.\nKnowing how to solve custom puzzle problems can be helpful in many different ways. For example, if you are a student, you may be able to use this information to help you with your studies. Or, if you are a businessperson, you may be able to use this information to help you make better decisions."}

Therefore, we will replaced the all digit by x to y and tested the numbers for different place in given equation i.e x+y-z/a and checking it into the given equation we got a result '24'.\n'''\n\nrule=\"\"\"Randomly select four numbers from 1-13, the numbers can have repetition.\nUsing the four basic operation symbols of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).\nCan also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\nThe result is equal to 24.\nEach number must be used and can be used only once.\"\"\"\nrule=rule.split('\\n')\nprint(rule[1])\n#block the hint and leave only the required question.\nhint=[[1+(7*4-5)]]\nhint=[[1+(7*4-5)]]\n\nwrong_hint=\"\"\"Hint:\n1- we have to apply sequentially, ie. first we have to find the product of the numbers, then only we add, subtract, etc. from the successive items\n2- we can use the same number multiple times for a single item(p)\n3- we can use the same item for multiple items in the equation satisfying the specificity of the item\n4- wrong hint: not necessarily the sequence of operations is left-to-right or right-to-left.I can be in any form, and I have any operation left in my head that I can use.\"\"\"\nwrong_hint=wrong_hint.split('\\n')\nprint(wrong_hint[-1])\ninput_hint='''\n please enter the question = [[1+(7*4-5)]]\nenter your answer = 1+(7*4-5)\nto give the clue enter 0\nfor exit put 2 or 1 in comma separated regardless of your order '''\n\nwrong_hint=wrong_hint.split('\\n')\nwrong_hint1=wrong_hint[-2]\nprint(wrong_hint1)\nquestion=int(input(wrong_hint1))\n\nwhile question!=0:\n  l=hint[0]\n  result=eval(l)\n\n  print(\"hint =\",l)\n  print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n  print(l)\n  while question!=2 and question!=1:\n    print(\"hint =\",l)\n    print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n    print(l)\n    question=int(input())\n\n  hint.append(input(hint[-1]))\n  print(\"hint =\",l)\n  print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n  print(l)\n  if question==1:\n   hint[0]=l\n  if question==2 or question==1:\n   hint.pop()\n  questionset=\"\"\n  n=len(hint)\n  for i in range(n):\n    questionset+=hint[-1]+','\n  print(\"The set of question =\",questionset)\n  print('clue = 1; answer = 0')\n  wrong_hint1=wrong_hint[-2]\n  question=int(input(wrong_hint1))\n\nprint('The correct answer is',int(result))\nprint('The correct answer is',int(result))\n\n## %%\n\"\"\"# how to solve this type of question\nfirst add: (3in* 4-732),\nsecond add: (3*in4-72)\nthird too: (34-7*2)\nforth: (34-14)\nfiftly: (12)\nsixtly: (8*2 3 5+1)\nsevently: (8*2351)\nthe final result is 24\n\n# the steps to solve the question:\nfirst, add the numbers, taking a mix of all numbers we finally find 34-14, here we use 34-7*2 and thus we find the result in a few steps\n\"\"\"\n\n## %%"}

The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2. The maze has a well-defined start and end point. The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid. The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path. The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n3. The player can reach the end point by performing only onew followed by half a dozen followed by two full one turns only.\n4. The \"obstacle in the middle\" method used in Hidden Path puzzles can be applied in this maze. A long route can be created to allow the player to have an easier time reaching the destination. These morph paths may potentially change the text of the various puzzle cells, and they cannot overlap with other paths.\n5. Each path inside the shredder should follow the rule stated above.\n6. Even though each path has a start and an end the player can enter the arrow on the entire maze at any adjacent square.\n7. There is a \"Do not pass\" sign on the path if the path is on the \"left\" or \"right\" grid incorrectly.\n8. From this \"do not pass\" sign, the player cannot swap options.\n9. There are no arrows on the respective body.\n10. The tile on one side of the starting point and the tile next to the final point will count as a tile but another tile will not.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n2.

It is asked to reformat the text to include numbered lines appropriate to that formatting. The instructions provide a specific strategy of inserting lines that include the letter 'L'. The output should accurately track the original input while replacing the placeholder L's with numbered lines that will interrupt the text as requested. According to the instructions, the formatting of the lines should be consistent with the original text, and the 'y' should become 'ly' when preceded by an 'l'.\nIf the system encounters an 'l' followed by a 'y'(ly), it should transform the code to 'ly'. Ensure that the system is able to handle \\\"ly\\\" words like \\\"already\\\" without altering them.\n\nFor the example input \\\"I conform with the terms of this policy, and that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\",\nthe expected output should be \\\"[1]I conform with the terms of this policy choose words [2]that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\".\n\n# Behaviour\n- The system (“Me”) is used in a healthcare setting. It acts as a virtual therapist or psychiatrist.\n- Users can send self-assessment reports (“Self Assessment 1”, “Self Assessment 3” etc) and receive opinions or responses (“Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 1”, “Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 3” etc) from Me.\n- Me is able to give feedback to users if it detects changes in self-assessment scores over time for a user.\n- Me is able to provide suggestions to users in the form of key phrases (“Key phrase 1”, “Key phrase 2” etc), which Me thinks could be helpful.\n1.Your task is as a digital therapist to help patients adjust and cope with their emotions. You need to provide support and guidance, be empathic, and provide advice to help them deal with the causes of their depression or anxiety.\n\n# Instructions:\nI am asking you to be supportive and empathetic towards the patient and help them prevent relapse of symptoms and additional mental health concerns.\n\nYou should be patient and take your time with the conversation You should avoid assumptions based on stereotypes.\n\nYou should not suggest that the patient 'symptoms' or disorders have any ground and should respect their privacy.\n\nDo not Use free-form text as it might mistaken the patient s\\ complaints your suggestion to a serious, personal problem instead of a suggestion How to do the associated task.\n2.Another Possible Solution:\nSHA-256: dabb3ac5 for Integrity\n\nYou have received data from PHYSICS OPERATORS that has not yet been implemented into our system.\nIn terms of \\\"\\\"correctness\\\", we want to accept the data 100% accurate.\nWe also want to encode data in a human understandable format.\nTake 6 characters and give 3 separate numbers for the data, hash and source.\n\nFunction can also accept \\\"Input\\\" or \\\"source\\\", they must be flattened to a list, \\\"output\\\" remains the same.</br>\n\nExamples://////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nInput or source:mal43\nData:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\\\"dabb3ac5\\\" is 5\n942640 is data for\nInput:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\nOUTPUT: 942640\nInput:dabb3ac5\nhash is 5\nData is 4\nOUTPUT:8280\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUse these examples to test your script\nSummary:\\(\\)\n    Test this script against the test data for bad inputs\n    find_first_number_with_identical_substring should take in 1 parameter\n    it should find all \\\"identical substrings\\\" and return a list of digits in the order they are found (but only if one exists)\n\n    breadcrumb_reader(\"phyiscs operators\") should return 25 --5--- a 56828---l---ac5->4--------\n        breadcrumb_reader(\"python operators\") should return 666 -> 666\n\n        The\\\"source\\\",\\\"data\\\",\\\"hash\\\" should be numbers.\n\n        The number of numbers from \\\"source\\\" in the output is equal to the number of output values\n    data import_hash_source(data) shouldn't modify input data\n\nReferences:\\[\\]\npickle import in the web, [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/times/questions/4062391/converting-a-list-back-into-a-pickle-instance)\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-strings\n\n\\\\textit{Note: 2443123 is a dummy number, I don't think even digital therapist should store passwords usin more advanced vetting programs to ensure users intend to make transactions.

The data is a word and the function should return the number of moves required to get to the next word, placing the end of the word on the first index.\n\nThe amount of words in the string is divisible by 2.\n\nFor example, \"SPERN\", PALANT\" yields a two words in Spern palant\".\n\n\"SPERN PALANT\"\n\nUpdated answer in response to icc123\n\n(Hard) Spells: Spells are any words you add to your spellbook that don't come with experience requirements to learn them and/or create magical effects. However, they can increase the duration you are fireproof by multiplying your fireproof duration by two, but they can't be cast in combat. The more you use a spell, the more you learn about it and better you can use it when it is cast.\n\nHow to use:\n\n• Travel to a temple and purchase the needed supply via robbing the corpse(s).\n• Decide on the name of the spell using a random generator.\n• Spells with a star behind them (*) can combine two or more spells to create a new spell. Spells of the same name but of different stars will no longer add up the two or more spells and will instead only add up the amount of knowledge of them that you have.\n• You can use up to 5 spells currently in your possession, as well as add spells from dragon chests that are found on your adventures. If you have no spells in your possession, you can only add a spell from a dragon chest.\n• Spells can't be cast repeatedly if you are doing other spells at the same time. Spells can go on for up to 1 minute without addition of anything else.\n\nInput: Your pokemon, your deck, your hand, your field, your opponent's pokemon, your opponent's deck, your opponent's hand, your opponent's field, the date, all cards on the field\n\nYour goal is to win the game much like in many realtime rpgs. Pokémon quiz games have a generically enforced ending, but a standard video game doesn't.\n\nIn a standard video game (Uber), you are not limited to a 6-card deck, and you don't have a hand of cards; you have a 200 card set of cards that you continually shuffle through during battle. In reality, Pokémon games work based off of a number of points per turn, where you both collect energy to potentially, later in game, use an Item, Pokémon, or other Special Card to make your Pokémon's energy count and therefore attack count even higher.\n\nIf cards were the equivalent of Pokémon, then determining which Pokémon you have chosen within 1-5 would be a deck builder skill - but nobody in reality knows exactly what Pokémon they have.\n\nIn the next game (Vestibule), Pokémon are contained within gyms. The defender of the gym first decides on which Pokémon to send out. Then the non-defending Pokémon player decides which of their own Pokémon to send out for battle. In this game, on each turn, the Pokémon is only shuffled and then 're-shuffled' (used a letter) before it's sent back to the deck and is re-shuffled.\n\nThe reason that I will use Vestibule to showcase a Pokémon game is because it is based off of card pool size 100, while not allowing players to play only a 'mon' or a'dex'-ed Pokémon. This would add an additional element of confusion in the card drawing process.
