Since we have two 4-digit numbers 'SEND' and 'MORE', and 'M' and 'S' are the thousands place, they cannot represent 0.\n2. There are ten unique letters in the equation, so each letter represents a unique digit from 0 to 9. \n\nStarting with 'E+O=E', the only possible value for both E and O is 0, as any number added to itself cannot result in the same digit without a carry-over, except for 0. \n\nNow, we have:\n\nS=1-9 (not 0)\nE=0\nN=?\nD=?\nM=1-9 (not 0)\nO=0\nR=?\nY=?\n\nNext, looking at 'N+R=O', since O is 0, N and R must be 5 and 5 or some permutation of digits that add up to 10 with a carryover, e.g., 6+4=10. So, either N or R must be 5. \n\nAssuming N=5, then M+5=S (a number from 1-9). Trying M=4 gives S=9, which is a valid option. \n\nWe now have:\n\nS=9\nE=0\nN=5\nD=?\nM=4\nO=0\nR=5\nY=?\n\nD+E=O: This means D=0, as we already have E=0, and there cannot be duplicate digits. \n\nWith Y+E=Y, Y could be 1, as 1+0=1, but this is not valid as E already represents 0. So, Y=10 with a carryover, meaning E+Y=10. Thus, Y=9. \n\nFinal assignments:\n\n[[S=9, E=0, N=5, D=0, M=4, O=0, R=5, Y=9]]"}

The '2' at (1,4) also suggests two mines at (0,3) and (1,3).\n2. Place 'A' in squares that are definitely mines.

The rest of the squares marked with 'X', without any surrounding number clues, remain uncertain and could either be empty or contain mines.\n3.
