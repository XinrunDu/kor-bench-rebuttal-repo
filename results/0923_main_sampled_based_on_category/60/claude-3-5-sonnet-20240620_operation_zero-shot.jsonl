We're given f(x) = x and g(x) = cosx\n\n2. According to the rule, f△g = (f(g(x)))′\n\n3. Let's first find f(g(x)):\n   f(g(x)) = f(cosx) = cosx\n\n4. Now we need to differentiate this with respect to x:\n   (f(g(x)))′ = (cosx)′ = -sinx\n\n5. So, f△g = -sinx\n\n6. The question asks for the value when x = π\n\n7. Evaluating -sinx at x = π:\n   -sin(π) = 0\n\nTherefore, the value of f△g when x = π is:\n\n[[0]]"}
