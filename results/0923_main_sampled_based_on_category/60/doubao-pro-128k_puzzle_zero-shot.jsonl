But since we have three terms (ONE, ONE, and TWO), even if each term were 999, the sum would be 2997. So, F must be 1 or 2.\n- Looking at the units column, we have E + E + O = R. Since the maximum value of E is 9, and the maximum value of O is 9, the maximum value of E + E + O is 27. So, R must be less than or equal to 7. Also, since O + O + T = F, and F cannot be 0 (as the first digit of a number cannot be 0), the smallest possible value for F is 1. If F is 1, then the maximum value of O + O + T is 19. So, O must be less than or equal to 9. Trying different values, we find that if O = 1, then T = 0, but the first digit of a number cannot be 0. So, O cannot be 1. Trying O = 2, we get T = 5.\n- Now, with O = 2 and T = 5, we have E + E + 2 = R. Trying different values for E, we find that if E = 3, then R = 8.\n- Now, we have 2N2 + 2N2 + 5W3 = 1U8R. Looking at the tens column, we have N + N + W = U. Since we already have O = 2, T = 5, E = 3, and R = 8, we can try different values for N and W to find that if N = 2, then W = 4 and U = 7.\nSo, the solution is [[O=1,N=2,E=3,W=4,T=5,F=6,U=7,R=8]]. "}
