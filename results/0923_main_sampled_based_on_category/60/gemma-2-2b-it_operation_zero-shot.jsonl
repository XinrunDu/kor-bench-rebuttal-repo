Understand the New Rule:**\n\nThe original rule was A ○ B = (A+3B) × (A+B).  We've modified it to: A ○ B = (A + 3B) × (xA + yB)  where x and y are parameters.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Information:**\n\n*  7 ○ 2 = 208 \n*  2 ○ 3 = 77 \n\n**3. Set up Equations:**\n\n* Let's plug values from our given information into the new rule. \n\n    * 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3 * 2) × (7a + 2b) --> 208 = (13) × (7a + 2b) \n    * 2 ○ 3 = (2 + 3 * 3) × (2a + 3b) --> 77 = (11) × (2a + 3b)\n\n\n**4. Solve for x and y:**\n\nWe can solve for x and y by finding a common solution (consistent values of x, and y) that satisfies both equations.\n\n\n**Conclusion**  The issue is that there's not enough information provided to determine specific integer values of x and y that satisfy the given equations. There may be an infinite number of solutions depending on how a user defines x and y to get 208 and 77 as a result after solving for x and y through basic operations on integers. \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to explore other related problems or operations using our modified rule! \n"}
