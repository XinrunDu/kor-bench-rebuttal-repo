If you have any questions or suggestions for the problemdescription, please contact the administrator of this forum. ]]\n\n### Question:\nNow there is another change in the operation rule. For example, when a is a multiple of b, a※b=a/b+A.FindA.\nFor the answer, please choose one of the following options:\n1. The calculation between all items\n\n\n2. \"a\" (1st item)÷\"b\" (2nd item)≠\"A·\" (3rd item)\n3. \"a\" (1st item)÷\"b\" (2nd item)≤\"A\" (3rd item)\n4. \"a\" (1st item)÷\"b\" (2nd item)≤\"A\" (3rd item)\n\nWith the above operation rules, provide an example of test cases where a, b, and the answer are: a=5,b=3,a%%b=24÷b=2,3%b=-2a※b=24,Answer=1 ,the answer is \"7\"\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1 or 3]]\n\nHi,\n\nThe wrong answers all are based on the first rule. 5/25 is 1/5, so a and b cannot be multiples of each other. But these answers claim they are, so are in violation of the first rule.\nThe second rule also fails if I put in 2/5 instead of 5/25, so that one's not right either.\nAnd the first rule breaks if I try a and b both are not multiples of each other, it becomes 24/24.\n\nPlease correct the question.\n\nWe have addressed the issues you raised. \n\nIn order to address the issues raised, the questions have been modified.\nVersion 2:\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/568231/stackoverflow-interview-may18\n\nVersion 3:\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/568212/stackoverflow-interview-may18-\n\nWhere did the mistake occur in the explanations ?\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/568212/stackoverflow-interview-may18\n\nHi\nPlease update the question.

Therefore, we should consider if there is an answer that follows the rule and hides the root.\n\nWe can refer to known cases with roots:\n\na^b = \\sqrt[b]{a^b}\na^{b+\\c{n}} = \\sqrt[b]{a} * \\sqrt[b]{a^{b+\\c{n}-\\c{1}}}\na^{b+\\c{2}} = \\sqrt[b]{a}\\sqrt[b]{a^{b}}\n\nIn this case, if a=b, then we'd have 3^3=3 to prove:\n5=\\sqrt{3+3}\\\\\n5=\\sqrt{6\\\\\nTherefore, 5 is a 4%3.\n\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\frac{15+\\sqrt{75}}{2}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {5*4} = 25+\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{5+4}+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2} =\\sqrt {20+\\sqrt {20}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {4}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt {20-2\\sqrt {}}{20-2\\sqrt {5}}}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt { 45-14\\sqrt {5}}}\n\n25+\\sqrt {16} = 36\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{25+\\sqrt{20+\\sqrt{20}}}\\sqrt{\\sqrt { 5}+{\\sqrt {4}}}=\\sqrt{\\sqrt {25+5+2\\sqrt{5}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{\\sqrt{30+\\sqrt{60+20}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt {\\sqrt 60+4+2\\sqrt4 +2\\sqrt(5*\\sqrt2)}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt 6}=3\\sqrt{\\sqrt {15}+2\\sqrt3+{2\\sqrt2}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt 15\\\\\n36 = 6\\sqrt5\\text{ ans.}\\sqrt{30+6\\sqrt 5}\n\nNow, 16%8 should be 0 and 16%6 should be 3.\n\n- Therefore, the answer is 3+\\sqrt{15}.\n\n- 16%1 should be 4, 16%2 should be 64 and 16%1 should be 64.\n\n- 16%5+5 should be 25+\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt {5+4.} Multiplying the number on the top can produce `25+5`, which is indeed proven in the above work.\n\nThe best answer is `5-+-\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {\\sqrt {45-14\\sqrt {5}}}.\\text{With the first answer, take the value as 64, then multiply the two terms to get back to the original result.\n\n###### Solution 2:\n\nIn this question, the root of the answer is 2. Based on this result, the answer should look like:\n\n3+\\sqrt{2}\n\n3 is mulitplyied by the root 2, which also equals 2, ensuring that the given equation is valid.\n\nSince 16%4=0 and 16%6=3, the answer would be `[[2+\\sqrt{16-6}]]`.\n\nHowever, we should write it in the form `[[2+\\sqrt{x}]` `[[16-x]] The second problem:\n\n4%2 =  4 * 2 - 2^{4-1} = 8 - 16 / 3\n\n4%1 =  4 * 1 = 4\n"}

To express negative values, it is necessary to cover the original number with a minus symbol, so please pay attention.\n\nPlease align all parts of your answer in terms of the question number. Your answer should be written in a form that is both easy to read and easy to understand by other people. This rule specifically indicates that the answer only needs to meet the default number of characters; however, please make sure to wrap the answer in a bracket as explained earlier.\n\n### Submission format:\n\n- You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n- You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n- You may accept the original question (including \"answer\") in the first portion of the question box.\n- You are to prepare 3-7 responses.\n- You are to identify the format of the correct answer.\n- You are to adhere to the rule specified in the Question section.\n- You are to provide only the question number. If not applicable, you must write \"none.\".\n\n## Detailed Explanation:\n\n> 1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n\nIn the Question section, we are explaining the \"operation rule\". You will need to apply this rule exactly to solve the given question.\n\n> 2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n\nYour answer, as well as our answer, should be a number or a group of numbers. Double-check this step.\n\n> 3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nUpon receiving your answer, you should double-check it carefully a of least 4 times. This part is very important, so please take it seriously.\n\nThis rule is related to finding \"solution x\" in the given question. You will need to write the correct answer in the format provided, which has four parts:\n\n> Part 1: Clearly explain the \"operation rule\".\n\nExplaining the \"operation rule\" is crucial, as it will provide you with the necessary understanding of the rule and how to apply it to solve the given question correctly.\n\n> Part 2: Provide an example of your own.\n\nPlease provide a specific example to demonstrate your understanding of the \"operation rule\" and its application. This example will serve as reference for future calculations.\n\n> Part 3: Explain whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A.\n\nIt is crucial to determine whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A. Consider the example below.\n\nOperation Rule: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nOperation X: (1◎2)(3＋4)-(6◎1)\n\nFor this example, \"Operation X\" is not a valid substituted method for \"Operation A\". Therefore, we should proceed as follows to find the value of \"X\":\n\n(1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(8×2)(7)=(16×7) = 112\n\nThen, simplify the right side of the equation: (61x+2)◎(3◎7) = (61x+2)●(21) = (1261x+42)\n\nEquate the two sides and solve for \"X\":\n\n(16×7) = (1261x+42)\n\nSolve for \"X\":\n\nx = (16×7-42)/(1261)\n\nx = 86/1261\n\nx = 4/63\n\nTherefore, in this example, \"Operation X\" cannot be substituted for \"Operation A\".\n\n> Part 4: Clearly explain the method you used to find the correct answer.\n\nFinally, clearly illustrate the methods used to find the correct answer. This part will help readers understand how to solve similar problems in the future.\n\n##### Submission\n\n> You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n\n> You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n\n> Simplification with the rule for finding \"solution x\" and check the correctness through real calculations.\n\n##### Example:\n\n<a>\nThis is a simple calculation that directly satisfies the expression and achieves a correct result.\n\n<b>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2710, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(4◎1)+(2◎3)=[[10+20i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Answer\n\n$[[10+20i]]$\n\n<b\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2709, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[[3-4i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Explanation:\n\n①\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2716, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(1◎3)+(X◎2)=-8+14i\n②\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2718, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[61x+2]−[6x+2]\n③\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2726, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[41x+1]−[4x]+2\n④\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2738, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(4◎1)-(2◎2)]\n⑤\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2744, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(2◎1)+(1◎2)]−(2◎2)\n⑥\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2752, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=2+1−2\n⑦\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2766, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=1\n⑧\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2770, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×2]\n⑨\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2777, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[4－2]\n⑩\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2782, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×1]\n11\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2784, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2－2]\n⑫\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2790, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=0\n13\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2799, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[1×2]\n14\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2804, {level:1,limit"}

The custom operation requires 2 arguments, x and y, as well as the operator \"&\", \"*\" and the boundaries set in the defining function. The definitions of the operations (* = f f * ) indicate that the custom operation evaluates the given function (f) on the exterior region (D) based on the argument (x,y).\n\nTo compute f◆D, which requires use of f's f function, it is important to understand the meaning of & and \"*\" used in the definition. The & symbol represents the outermost expression, and \"*\" represents the inner nested expressions. This means that f◆D will be evaluated based on the arguments (x,y) using the specified function(s), and then a specific operation will be applied to the result.\n\nStarting with the first question, which asks to compute f◆D using f(x,y)=1, D: 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to this question should be:\n\nf◆D = ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy\nThe answer is a single number as required. To evaluate the integral ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, it is necessary to first determine the appropriate values of x and y that result in a non-zero fraction. In this case, only the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 satisfy all three arguments (x,y,f). Therefore, the integration region will be the area between these boundaries. The double integrals yields the value of the integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅1⋅dx·dy + ∫(2-1)⋅(3-2)⋅1⋅dx·dy = 2⋅2⋅1+1⋅1⋅dx·dy = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is:\n\nf◆D = [4]\n\nFor the second question, f(x,y)=xy, D:1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to the question should also be a single number. Note that the custom operation is the same in both questions, the only difference is the function definition, and the boundaries. Evaluating the function F by ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, yields:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = x⋅y⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration. In this case, the easiest way to find the appropriate bounds is to graphically observe the region defined by the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644949-90edfb0d-5963-4dc5-b2de-7d4ed72e4713.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral. The integral of this function is:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫xy⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫2⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅∫2⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅[(y+1)−(0+1)] = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅(y+1) = 8x⋅y2+8xy\nTherefore, the answer to the second question is:\n\nf◆D = [8(2)⋅32+8⋅(2⋅3)]=128\n\nFor the third question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand is:\n\nf(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y\nThe integration region has the same form as the region defined by 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 in the first question, so this question may be answered in a similar way:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅x2+y2⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nNote that the integrand is still constant and integration region has not changed:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅2⋅[(1+2)2+(0+1)2] = 6x2+6y2 = 6(x2+y2)\nTherefore, the answer to the third question is:\n\nf◆D = [6(12+32)]=40/3\n\nFor the fourth question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand and integration region are the same as in the previous question. Therefore, the integral can be evaluated:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(1+2)⋅(3-1)⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = ∫3⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫3⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644983-7a850cf2-36b9-4e30-b697-6b74bb9ab9d5.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫(x"}

Our aim was to multiply each element of Matrix A by the corresponding element of Matrix B and then add them up to obtain the resulting matrix.\n* Section 4.3 introduced operations applied to elements in a vector, including adding one element to another element, subtracting one element from another element, replacing one element with two different numbers, and producing a new vector as a single element. This was all derived from the fundamental operation of working on the elements.\n* Then the pedagogy section 4.4 addressed matrix operations where each element of a matrix was multiplied by another element, such as matrix multiplication with a scalar or matrix multiplication with a matrix.\n* In section 4.5, we delved into vector multiplication, linear transformation, and vector addition, showing how they were represented in Python.\n* Here's a brief summary of the operations covered throughout the book:\n  * addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and element-by-element multiplication of two matrices (section 4.2 in the video)\n  * element-by-element addition and subtraction of vectors (section 4.3 in the video)\n  * scalar multiplication of a matrix by a vector, scalar multiplication of a vector, and scalar multiplication of a vector by a matrix (section 4.5 in the video)\n\nThe course material was presented without a strict sequence in the video, but a clear structure can help extract knowledge from it. Based on the structure in the video, students can organize their notes as listed in bold, enclosed in red brackets.\n\n### Exercises\n\nExercise 1.\nIn the table below, perform the requested operations on the provided matrices A and B.
