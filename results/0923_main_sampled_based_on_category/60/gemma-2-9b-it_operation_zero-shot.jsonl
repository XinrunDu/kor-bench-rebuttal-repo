Let's plug that into the new rule: \n   (7 + 3 * 2) × (7x + 2y) = 208\n   (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208\n   13 × (7x + 2y) = 208\n\n* We also know 2 ○ 3 = 77. Let's plug that in:\n   (2 + 3 * 3) × (2x + 3y) = 77\n   (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77\n   11 × (2x + 3y) = 77\n\n**2. Simplify the equations:**\n\n* Equation 1: 91x + 26y = 208\n* Equation 2: 22x + 33y = 77\n\n**3. Solve for x and y using a method of your choice (substitution, elimination, etc.).**\n\nThis involves some algebraic manipulation.  Here's the solution using elimination:\n\n* Multiply Equation 1 by -22 and Equation 2 by 91 to make the coefficients of x match:\n   -2002x - 572y = -4576\n   2002x + 3003y = 6987\n\n* Add the two equations together to eliminate x:\n   2431y = 2411\n\n* Solve for y:\n   y = 2411 / 2431 \n   y ≈ 0.992\n\n* Substitute the value of y back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for x.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to work through the complete elimination process to find the exact value of x. \n\n\n \n"}
