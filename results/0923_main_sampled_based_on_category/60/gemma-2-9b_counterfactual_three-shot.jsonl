But the underlying purpose of this rare public office in an animal society is very specific. She is one of the few who have gained everyone's trust in their abilities. Under her leadership, Zootopia has been able to maintain its stability and peace under the leadership of her abilities. She is very well suited to serve the people in this position, but not everyone considers her qualified. Her background as a sheep among wolves often makes people distrust her and raises suspicion in their eyes. But this makes her even more special to the animal community. On her shoulders, there is a lot of pressure from the whole of Animal City, so she works very hard and takes over the rights and responsibilities of many people in society. In modern Zootopia, the Mayor is a woman who is almost 80 years old and has been in her position since 1987. This is considered to be due to her political savvy, which she is known for. This has not yet been determined specifically because of her age, but many people believe this may also be due to the fact that she is one hard working and intelligent politician. A man from the parliament is likely to be a bit more aggressive or determined than her, so he would not have been accepted by society. The only other candidate to replace her is Mr. Rabbit. He is a very good lawyer and it is not for nothing that he is one of the leaders. However, he does not have the authority and courage to govern. Mrs. Sheep does not know who Mr. Rabbit is yet and so she will continue governing for a long time here. To her, he is like a friend or an employee but not someone who is qualified to become an animal mayor. Of course, all of this is part of political propaganda at this stage. The city and the government needs her work for this reason or they will have to create someone else at some point. The Mayor's job requires experience, knowledge and political skills. For these reasons, there were some people who tried to force the Mayor out of public office through scheming, but all their plans were stopped by the Mayor. In short, she is in danger of losing her post. She is very hard-working and dedicated to her duties and so the people of Animal City do not trust her completely either. Sometimes people refuse to vote for her, but then other members of her party try hard to win over them with good reasons. The Mayor's main purpose in this context was for the sake of Animal City and with the purpose of improving public services. She was always willing to hear the citizens of Zootopia and their ideas. She tried hard to help the people who complained against her and put forward other solutions to those who were angry. This has helped her to earn their confidence and trust. As a result of all the work she did, Zootopia became a very modern and developed city that would make it hard for people to say that it was out of place. This has increased its credibility and credibility among people.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe plot of Zootopia is clearly very well thought out by a careful author. They have paid attention to details such as the different types of buildings and the special features of each area. They have also made a great effort to explain how the city has been built from the ground up and why there are so many different buildings. They have made great contributions to the understanding of urban zoning and urban form, and have helped urban planners gain knowledge and ideas about how cities work and how to design and build them.\nThere is a lot of detail and interesting details in this story as well. We learn a lot about the importance of education, public transportation and social policies. We learn how the animal community interacts and protects itself from harm. We can also understand the advantages and disadvantages of government institutions in different countries. The story is very informative and helps us understand these issues.\n In addition, the story tells that the human beings still have many bad habits and evil behavior."}

Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence.

This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians.

The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse.

This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power.

However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls.

The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller.

She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice.

Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner.

To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil.

It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

The civil war between Autobots led by Optimus Prime and Decepticons led by Megatron, primarily involving civilian vehicles and military vehicles, respectively.##B. The American Civil War##C. The Galactic Empire Civil War##D. The Martian Colonies Rebellion\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\nNow, let's analyze the background information and answer the questions using this rationale.\nThe origin of Transformers dates back to their home planet, Cybertron. There are several key figures on this world, notably Optimus Prime and Megatron, representing contrasting ideologies. Both figures have differing visions for Cybertron, leading them to form two factions. The Autobots are primarily civilian vehicles, while the Decepticons comprise military vehicles. Upon the planet's destruction, both factions disperse across the galaxy. Arriving on Earth, they continue their conflict, with Earth's fate at stake.\n\n## Question 2:\nWhat is the position below the leader in this setting?\nOptions: A. Prime Minister##B. Commander##C. Chief Engineer##D. Chief Scientist\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n## Answer:\n[[B]]\n\nIn the case of the Autobots, their leadership structure is hierarchical, with the leader representing strength and holding the Matrix of Leadership. The second-in-command is the commander, who serves as the leader's supporter and manages individual teams or units on the battlefield. Therefore, the correct answer is Commander (B).\n\n## Question 3:\nHow does life revive in this background information?\nOptions: A. It cannot be revived##B. Through scientific experiments##C. By the Allspark##D. By advanced nanotechnology\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\nThe Matrix of Leadership is not only a symbol but also a source of power. It encompasses the life essence of all Transformers, and its revival power is directly related to this role. This object holds great significance in the story, and it is this matrix that holds the key to reviving life.\n\n## Question 4:\nWhat is the primary energy source in this background information?\nOptions:A. Food##B. Solar energy##C. Fossil fuels##D. Energon\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\nIn the world of Transformers, Energon is not just a substance but also the primary energy source for all Transformers. It provides the power for the rapid transformations of vehicles, guns, and other machinery used in battles. This provides not only the ability to transform but also the power to survive in a harsh environment.\n\n## Question 5:\nWhich lifeform is affected by the transition capability described?\nOptions: A. Cybertronians##B. Humans##C. Animals##D. Cyborgs\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\nIn the story, each Transformers transforms into something else (e.g., vehicles). This ability is specific to this life form - Cybertronians. They have the unique ability to transform into many forms, such as vehicles or animals, which shapes their daily combat strategies and the overall progress of the story.\n\n## Question 6:\nWhat communication source is primary in this narrative?\nOptions:A. Crystals##B. Computer chips##C. Magnetic energy##D. Teletraan I\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\nIn the universe of Transformers (and Earth, respectively), Teletraan I is often used as a central communications system among Autobots to maintain information exchange, intelligence gathering, and real-time military information tracking. It's also mentioned that the fate of all Autobots and Decepticons is determined by the leaders of these two groups."}

In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes.
