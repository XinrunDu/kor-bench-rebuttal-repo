For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, what should it be denoted as if it is both a tautology and a basic form? The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "If formula A contains 4 propositional variables, there are 2^4 = 16 possible paired conjunctive terms. For A to be a tautology, it must include all 16 paired conjunctive terms. A basic formula must include m0.\n\nHowever, for a formula to be both a tautology and a basic form is logically impossible. A basic formula specifically requires the inclusion of m0 but being a tautology implies including all paired conjunctive terms, which is already a complete set.\n\nThus, there is no logical status where formula A can simultaneously be a tautology and a basic form.\n\nThe correct notation to indicate this impossibility is [[]]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formulas.\n(1) ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n(2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\nThe answer format  is [[T:...;F:...];[T:...;F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).For example [[T:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713;F:x|x|x];[T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the truth values and falsity values for the given formulas, let's analyze each formula step by step according to the defined logic rules.\n\n### Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\n1. Identify components: \n   - p1, p2, and ~p3 are Level A formulas.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) means p1&p2&~p3 must be false for the entire formula to be true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is false under assignments: x|x|x, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|x|x, or any combination where at least one of p1 or p2 is false, or p3 is true.\n   - Therefore, some true assignments for ~(p1&p2&~p3) are: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is false when p1&p2&~p3 is true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is true under the assignment: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n   - Therefore, the false assignment for ~(p1&p2&~p3) is: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n\n### Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\n1. Identify components:\n   - ~p1 and p2 are Level A formulas.\n   - ~p1&p2 is a Level B formula.\n   - p1=p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is true except when (~p1&p2) is true and (p1=p3) is false.\n   - (~p1&p2) is true under assignments: x|\u2713|x, x|\u2713|\u2713.\n   - (p1=p3) is false when p1 and p3 have different truth values (\u2713|x or x|\u2713).\n   - So, true assignments include: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - This is specifically false when ~p1&p2 is true and p1=p3 is false.\n   - From above, this results in the assignment x|\u2713|x.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\nCombine the results for both formulas:\n\\[ [ \\text{T}: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: \u2713|\u2713|x ] ; [ \\text{T}: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: x|\u2713|x ] \\]\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n\\[ [[T:x|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713,\u2713|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[T:\u2713|x|\u2713,x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:x|\u2713|x]] \\]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nFind the falsity values of the following formulas:\n(1)~(~p1&p2)||~p3\n(2)(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n(3)(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\nThe answer format is [[F:...];[F:...];[F:...]].If there are multiple values in F, they should be separated by commas (,).For example [[F:x|x|x];[F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713];[F:x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the falsity values of the given formulas, we need to analyze each formula according to the logical rules specified.\n\n(1) Formula: ~(~p1&p2)||~p3\n\nFalse when:\n- ~(~p1&p2) is false, meaning (~p1&p2) is true, which requires p1 to be false and p2 to be true (x|\u2713).\n- ~p3 is false, meaning p3 is true (\u2713).\n\nSo, for the entire formula to be false, it needs: p1 = x, p2 = \u2713, p3 = \u2713, i.e., x|\u2713|\u2713.\n\n(2) Formula: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\nFalse when:\n- (~p2||p3) is false, meaning both ~p2 is false and p3 is false, which requires p2 to be true and p3 to be false (\u2713|x).\n- (p1=::>p2) is false, meaning p1 is true and p2 is false (\u2713|x).\n\nThe combination of these conditions cannot occur simultaneously, so there are no false assignments for this formula.\n\n(3) Formula: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\nFalse when:\n- (p1=::>p2) is false, requiring p1 to be true and p2 to be false (\u2713|x).\n- (~(p1&p3)||p1) is false, requiring ~(p1&p3) to be false and p1 to be false. This condition is not possible since p1 cannot simultaneously be true and false for this section, meaning there are no false assignments meeting these conditions.\n\nCombining all the falsity values:\n\n\\[\n[[F:x|\u2713|\u2713];[F:];[F:]]\n\\]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]"}

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"(A\u2192B) = df (\u00acA\u2228B).\"\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[F]]"}

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nA: All soccer players are on the field.\nB: Some soccer players are on the field.\nHere, the pair <all, some> forms a hierarchy. \nTherefore, if the speaker says B, it indicates that they know saying A does not match the facts. \n\nWhich principle did the speaker use to reveal the truth?\n\nA.

By saying \"I believe,\" they avoid claiming \"I know,\" which would require more certainty.\n\n2. **Hearer's Inference (CQ2):** Since the speaker says \"I believe you are a college student\" (weaker statement), and it does not definitively entail \"you are a college student,\" while \"I know you are a college student\" (stronger statement) does entail it, we can deduce that ~K(Q). The speaker does not know whether the clause \"you are a college student\" can be established. Here, <believe, know> form a contrast set, fitting the CQ2 inference pattern.\n\nThus, this situation adheres to the C* Principle.\n\n[[A]]"}

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle the statement conforms to, let's apply the given logic rules:\n\n- **C* Principle (Cooperation and Strength of Information):** This principle involves saying something weaker or stronger and making inferences based on known contrasts or the inability to assert stronger claims. The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm\" does not provide enough context about information strength or contrasting sets for inference as described in the CQ1 or CQ2 patterns.\n\n- **C% Principle (Minimalization of Expression):** This principle involves speaking minimally and relies on conventional relationships and expanding information from minimal speech. The statement about the beer being part of the food in the food box seems to relate to conventional associations\u2014food items often include beverages in a \"food box.\"\n\n- **C! Principle (Avoidance of Unmarked Expressions):** This principle focuses on not using lengthy or marked expressions unnecessarily. The given statement doesn't involve lengthy or complex language; it's straightforward.\n\nSince the statement likely reflects conventional associations (beer as part of food in a conventional context such as a picnic or meal), it aligns best with the minimalistic convention of the C% Principle.\n\nThe answer is: [[B]]"}

This implies a specific context where a nurse is receiving the flowers.\n- Common sense inference: nurses are commonly known to be female, leading to the inference that Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\n\nApplying the principles:\n\n- **C***: This principle involves making statements as strong as the knowledge allows and making inferences about the speaker's knowledge. The inference about the nurse being female is based on common stereotypes rather than a specific knowledge-driven weaker statement versus stronger statement pairing.\n  \n- **C%**: This principle focuses on saying the minimum necessary and conventional assumptions. The inference relies on a conventional societal stereotype (that a nurse is likely female), aligning closely with CI1, which assumes conventional relationships unless there's evidence otherwise. Therefore, it follows the convention of female nurses.\n  \n- **C!**: This concerns avoiding obscure expressions and using conventional associations.
