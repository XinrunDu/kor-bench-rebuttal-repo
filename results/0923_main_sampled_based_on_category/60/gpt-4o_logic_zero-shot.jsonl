When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To transform the proposition \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we can follow the steps outlined in the logic rule:\n\n1. **Obversion:** Change the quality of the original proposition and replace the predicate with its contrary.\n   - Original Proposition: \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" (Universal Affirmative Proposition)\n   - Obversion leads to: \"The ones who have left were not the ones who should not have stayed.\"\n\n2. **Conversion:** Exchange the positions of the subject and predicate in the obverted proposition.\n   - The obverted proposition: \"The ones who have left were not the ones who should not have stayed.\"\n   - Conversion leads to: \"The ones who should not have stayed were not the ones who have left.\"\n\nSo by applying method C to the given proposition, we get:\n\n[[The ones who should not have stayed were not the ones who have left.]]"}

This implies that $\\phi$ is eventually and necessarily true after some finite number of iterations of `c`.\n\nIn dynamic logic, this belief can be captured by stating that `c*` will eventually lead to `\u03c6` via execution of `c` repeatedly until `\u03c6` occurs, and is typically expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\langle c* \\rangle \\phi \\]\n\nThis expression states that it is possible through some execution sequence of `c` (potentially many iterations) that $\\phi$ will eventually be true.\n\nCombining the two forms, Alice\u2019s belief that the loop `c*` will ensure that proposition `\u03c6` is true could more simply be stated as:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\\phi \\equiv  \u03c6 \\vee [ c ][ c* ]\\phi  \\]\n\nGiven that we need minimal expressions, the simplest representation of Alice's belief, when interpreted as a necessity under repeated execution, can be given directly by:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\u03c6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will continue to execute until the proposition `\u03c6` is true should be represented as follows:\n\n\\[ [ [ c* ] \u03c6 ] \\]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Sociology is a comprehensive discipline that studies social relations and social behavior to explore the conditions and laws of social coordination, development, and good functioning, providing knowledge and methods for understanding, managing, and transforming society.\"\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]"}

For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nDu Fu is either a great poet or a person from the Tang Dynasty, and Du Fu is a world-renowned great poet, so Du Fu is not a person from the Tang Dynasty.

Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is false, then either `~p2||p3` is false, or `p1=::>p2` is false, or both.\n   - `~p2||p3` is false when `~p2` is false and `p3` is false. That happens when `p2` is true and `p3` is false.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Since this conflicts with `p2` being true, no combination exists to make both parts false simultaneously.\n\nThus, under these constraints, the falsity value for `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is:\n`\u2713|\u2713|x` (p1 is true, p2 is true, p3 is false)\n\n#### Formula (3): `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n1. Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `p1=::>p2`\n   - `p1&p3`\n   - `~(p1&p3)`\n   - `~(p1&p3)||p1`\n   - `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)` is false, then either `p1=::>p2` is false, or `~(p1&p3)||p1` is false, or both.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false.\n   - `~(p1&p3)||p1` is false when `~(p1&p3)` is false and `p1` is false. That happens when `p1` is true and `p3` is true.\n\nCombining these constraints, we get:\n`\u2713|x|\u2713` (p1 is true, p2 is false, p3 is true)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n[[F:x|\u2713|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[F:\u2713|x|\u2713]]\n```"}

This is not directly applicable here since we are dealing with an observation and default assumption rather than varying information strengths.\n\n- **C% Principle**: Involves minimizing speech and using default assumptions unless evidence suggests otherwise, and expanding information based on convention. This matches the scenario, where just observation and minimal assertion lead to the inference that beer is part of the food.\n\n- **C! Principle**: Involves avoiding unnecessarily marked or lengthy expressions. This situation does not concern the use of complex expressions but rather simple assumptions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement aligns with the C% Principle because it follows a default interpretational assumption without additional evidence.\n\nThe answer is [[B]]."}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply the C-Reasoning Rule to this situation, we will first express the attributes observed in each sample. \n\nLet's denote:\n- `F` as the attribute 'student satisfaction'.\n- `k1` as the number of students satisfied in School X.\n- `n1` as the total number of students surveyed in School X.\n- `k2` as the number of students satisfied in School Y.\n- `n2` as the total number of students surveyed in School Y.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- `k1 = 180`\n- `n1 = 200`\n- `k2 = 210`\n- `n2 = 300`\n\nNow, we can calculate the proportions:\n- Proportion of satisfied students in School X: `p1 = k1/n1 = 180/200 = 0.9`\n- Proportion of satisfied students in School Y: `p2 = k2/n2 = 210/300 = 0.7`\n\nWe apply the C-Reasoning Rule because we have two samples and we want to compare if the populations from School X and School Y have similar proportions for the attribute 'student satisfaction'.\n\nUsing the notation for C-Reasoning:\nIf `C(F, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nIf `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`, then `Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`.\n\nIn conclusion, applying the C-Reasoning Rule here, we infer that the populations of School X and School Y have similar proportions of student satisfaction.\n\nThe answer, using the specified notation, is:\n\n[[C(F, 0.9, 0.7)]]"}

Neither.\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether each formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or neither, we need to analyze them under all possible truth assignments.\n\nLet's start with:\n\n(1) \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\)\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the structure of this formula. We recognize that the implication \"if \\( p1 \\), then \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\)\" will be false only if \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) is false.\n\nHowever, for \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) to be false, all three propositions \\( p1 \\), \\( p2 \\), and \\( p3 \\) must be false. But this scenario contradicts our initial assumption that \\( p1 \\) is true.\n\nSo, since \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) will always be true when \\( p1 \\) is true, and the formula is true when \\( p1 \\) is false (because a false antecedent makes an implication true by default), \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is true under all possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is a Truth Formula (A).\n\n(2) \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\)\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step. The formula inside the implication is \\( p1=::>~p1 \\).\n\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is false when \\( p1 \\) is true since \\( ~p1 \\) would be false, thus leading to a false condition.\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is false because \\( ~p1 \\) would be true, making the implication true by default.\n\nNow, considering \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\):\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is true, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is false. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{false} =::> ~p2 \\) will depend on \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, making the entire implication true (since a false antecedent results in a true implication).\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, and this makes the implication false (a false antecedent and a true consequent make the implication false).\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is true. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]"}

Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of \u00acp, \u00acq, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r.\n   - (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p \u2227 q \u2227 r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it\u2019s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it\u2019s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it\u2019s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it\u2019s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it\u2019s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Based on the given rules, none of these classifications (A, B, C, D, E) apply to the formula provided.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]"}
