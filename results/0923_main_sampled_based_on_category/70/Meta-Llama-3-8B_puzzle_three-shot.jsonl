Prefixes are commonly used to provide additional meaning to words, as in removing cancer (prefix \"re\") or bringing sunshine (prefix \"sun\"). In this case, the rule requires that a common prefix be added before these letter combinations to form meaningful words.\n\nSince one of the letter combinations is \"blem,\" the prefix \"def\" is inserted before it to form the word \"def vend, which means something close to healthy. This is a close match to one of the positive connotations of a 'common prefix' addition, and therefore it is selected as the answer."}

Understanding the problem requirements, constraints, and input/output formats can significantly impact the time spent solving a challenge and possibly even the solution efficiency.\n* To illustrate, let's consider a case study presented as a 3x3 chessboard. At specific chessboard cell locations, a knight(“K”) and queen (‘Q’) can attack each other. We wish to move either knight or queen to an unoccupied location on the chessboard without breaking the attacking relationship between them. Alternatively, if no unoccupied location like this exists, we must move either one of them outside of the chessboard.\n# Assumptions and Known Information\n* Knight can travel any 2 positions up/down if the position is on the row directly adjacent to the knight and only one position to either piece or row, separated by a wall or road, depending on the land type. Additionally, assume all roads on the chessboard are the same.\n* The queen can move any number of rows and columns provided an unoccupied space is available in its path.\n# Example Findings\n* An initial consultation with users(“U”) revealed a problem statement with a predefined chessboard board of X size, where X ≦ 8.\nAdditionally, U provides the initial location of the knight(“NK”) and queen (“NQ”) points on the board.\n* User inputs consist of two components within the “input caterpillar”: NU and Nkinght for NK and NQueen for NQ. A “caterpillar” separates the input components. Three commas separate the input components.\n* If Ninputs = only 1 Knight or only 1 Queen, the specialize function is not called.\n* If NU ≠ 0 from the input, it is an NC, so it is transformed into a separate code without involving “F().\n* The matrix check function verifies that all inputs are integers. Ai is transformed into A3 by subtracting A*T, and A ≥ 5 converted to a1.\n* The full equation after all transformations is given as follows:\nA=a0+a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+a6+a7\n* Specifically, “buffer” was used as the power variable in the above calculation, with the maximum value assigned as N.\n# Process Flow\n* We will proceed in the following manner:\n* Check for corner case conditions\n* Consulting the user\n* Assuming valid inputs\n* Implementing mathematical transformations through recopying and reshaping\n* Validating results\n* Making entries\n# Discussion\n* Failing to comprehend the problem entirely could possibly lead to time-consuming rescrambling. Strive to grasp the underlying concepts before beginning to tackle the challenge.\n* Besides this, caring for users' needs can benefit both parties. Delve into the users' role and establish a better frame of reference.\n* Recopying and reshaping can assist in transforming model inputs more efficiently, enhancing the transformation process and allowing more time for modelling adjustments and validation.\n# Solution Approach\n* Ensure that assumptions derived from users' feedback are incorporated into the problem-solving framework.\n* If the assumptions are in compliance, utilize the specialist code to verify the desired results and select the right checking code.\n* It is crucial to validate the results of the approach, as any deviation can impact the utility of the solution.\n"}

You have achieved 100% accuracy on this puzzle! 🏆\n\nYour code has passed all the test cases. If needed, make edits to improve your algorithm and efficiency.\n\nPlease have a copy of the tests for reference.\n\nSome tips for refining your solutions:\n\n1. Take advantage of built-in Python functions. Python offers many built-in functions, like sum(), min(), and max(), that can be used to simplify code and reduce repetition.\n2. Consider writing separate functions for specific tasks. Breaking down codes into smaller, manageable parts can make it easier to write and debug code.\n3. Check for precedence issues. Incorrectly placing parentheses can significantly impact the result of an equation.\n4. Consider using dictionaries. Dictionaries can help keep track of key items that need to be stored and retrieved efficiently.\n\nCan you write a Python program that can recognize numbers in a sequence?\n1. Use arrays to store numbers\n2. Use an iterative method to compare an element with the next two elements\n3. Use an index of three to access elements in arrays\n\n# Provided Code\ndef SearchThreeNumber(array,index):\n    if index+2 <= len(array):\n        counter = 0\n        if array[index] == 3 and array[index+1] == 2 and array[index+2] == 1:\n            counter = 1\n        return counter\n    return 0\n\ndef Solution(array):\n    counter = 0\n    for i in range(len(array)):\n        counter += SearchThreeNumber(array,i)\n    return counter\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    T = int(input())\n    data = []\n \n    for i in range(T):\n        temp = list(map(int,input().split()))\n        data.append(temp)\n \n    res = []\n    for i in range(T):\n        count = Solution(data[i])\n        res.append(str(count))\n \n    print(\" \".join(res))\n\n"}

One number indicates the number of mines exactly above the current field, the second indicates the concrete number directly below, and the last number describes the number of mines adjacent to the current field.\n\nWe need to find out the locations where mines are hidden and symbols are replaced by A\n\n\n\nIf the middle of the field is selected from the middle of the number 6 in the first column and the top right section in the first row, where there is a single symbol X. The resulting field will not explode, so select the entire line representing this field. By the same token, the selected field in the third column of the top row can also be selected.\n\nOur goal is to find the hidden bombs under the squares and replace the X symbols with an A symbol and the end result should give the final answer."}
