First, we check if 25 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* 25 would be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n2. Next, we have the result from step 1 (24) and check if 24 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* the result would still be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n3. Similarly, we check if 24 is a multiple of 14. It is not, so 14 *apt* 24 would also be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n4. Now, we have 24 *apt* 24 as the two intermediate results. We need to apply the operation again since 24 *apt* 24 wasn't initially defined.\n\n5. Check if 24 is a multiple of 24. They are both multiples of 12, but the rule only considers the smaller number in the case they are both multiples. Hence, 24 *apt* 24 = 24/24 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the final result: 24 *apt* 24 *apt* 14. Since the first two operations resulted in 2, the entire operation sequence is equivalent to 2 *apt* 14. Following the rule, since 2 is not a multiple of 14 and vice versa, 2 *apt* 14 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]]."}

Let's break it down:\n\n1. We know that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the components of the tuple.\n2. Since the rule (<a,b,c,d>=2ab+c-d) requires all variables a, b, c, and d to be integers, we can assume that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the variables a, b, c, and d respectively in this scenario.\n3. This means we need to substitute X with a, 6 with b, 12 with c, and 5 with d in the operation rule.\n4. We then get the equation: <X,6,12,5> = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n5. However, we are given that <X,6,12,5> equals 55. So, we have another equation: 55 = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n6. Solving for X, we can rearrange the equation as: 2X*6 - 5 + 55 = 12\n7. Simplifying, we get: 12X = 62\n8. Dividing by 12, we find: X = 5.166666666667 (This is not an integer, but due to the rounding done by the calculator used in the step 7, we may think that X is not an integer. But considering the rule, X should be an integer.)\n9. Since we are required to find X as an integer in the question, let's round X to the nearest integer. In this case, the nearest integer to 5.166666666667 is 5.\n10. However, since ⟨X,6,12,5⟩ is equal to 55, this means that when X = 5, the values for 6, 12, and 5 don't satisfy the equation <X,6,12,5> = 2*X*6 + 12 - 5. So, we need to find another integer value for X that does satisfy the equation.\n11. In order to find another integer value for X, we will start by trying lower integer values for X until we find one that satisfies the equation.\n12. We can try X = 4, which gives us the equation: <4,6,12,5> = 2*4*6 + 12 - 5\n13. Calculating this, we get: <4,6,12,5> = 48, but 48 is not equal to 55, so X ≠ 4.\n14. Let's try X = 3: <3,6,12,5> = 36 + 12 - 5\n15. Calculating this, we get: <3,6,12,5> = 45, but 45 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 3.\n16. Let's try X = 2: <2,6,12,5> = 24 + 12 - 5\n17. Calculating this, we get: <2,6,12,5> = 33, but 33 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 2.\n18. We haven't found the correct integer value for X yet, but we can see that each time we decreased the value of X by 1, the resulting number inside the angle brackets was increased by more than 12, which is the value of the (c) term in the equation.\n19. Now, if we think carefully about the example we were given, we can see that doubling the product of the variables a and b (or X and 6) itself might be greater than 45 (which we found in the case of X = 2).\n20. If we single out variable d (or 5) and leave a, b, and c unchanged from their original values, we can observe that doubling a (or X) would already yield a number greater than 55 (which is the given value of the whole expression).\n21. Continuing to use this intuition, and examining the pattern we got for the case of X = 3, we can understand that even if we decrease the value of b (or 6) by 1, we may still arrive at a value greater than 55 if we double a (or X).\n22. So, let's try X = -1 since doubling that value will still give us a negative number for the term X*6, and the final answer should still be a positive number.\n23. With X = -1 and the rest of the values unchanged, we have: <-1,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n24. Calculating this, we get: <-1,6,12,5> = 0, which is not equal to 55, so X ≠ -1.\n25. Let's try X = -2: <-2,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n26. Calculating this, we now find: <-2,6,12,5> = 5, which is equal to 55.\n27. Since we have found an integer value for X that satisfies the equation, the solution is X = -2.\n28. However, since the question asks us to find X without any signs, we'll need to change -2 to a positive number to fit the requirements of the question.\n29. To do so, we'll add 4*2 to +2, which gives us 2+8=10.\n30. In conclusion, the solution to the problem is X = 10.\n31. Wrapping up the answer in double square brackets, our answer is: [[10]]."}

We can use the rule to write another equation:\n\nlogX_512 + log512_X = log512_10 * K\n\nSince we need to express X as a single logarithm, we'll aim to eliminate the logX_512 term. We can do this by subtracting log512_X from both sides of the equation:\n\nlogX_512 - log512_X + log512_X + log512_10 * K = 0\n\nSince we're looking for logX_512 only, we'll rearrange the equation to isolate that term:\n\nlogX_512 = - (log512_X + log512_10 * K)\n\nNow, we need to find an expression for log512_X. We know that 512 = (82/9)^X, so we write the logarithm as following:\n\nlog512_X = X * log512_(82/9)\n\nSubstituting this expression into the previous equation:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + log512_10 * K)\n\nWe still have the change-of-base formula term in the equation, but we can rewrite it using our operation rule as:\n\nlog512_10 = (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10]\n\nNow, we can substitute the terms in the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10] * K)\n\nTo find X, we'll need to use numerical methods or calculus to solve this equation, but that's beyond the scope of this question. In most cases, providing an exact numerical answer while using only basic arithmetic operations is impossible, especially in reverse operations.\n\nHowever, to give an approximate numerical answer, we can make some approximations:\n\n* log2_(82/9) ≈ log2_2 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1.445\n* log512_2 ≈ 9.21\n* log2_10 ≈ 0.301\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 ≈ - (X * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * K))\n\nNow we can try to guess a value for X that makes the equation approximately true. For K, it's hard to guess a value without knowing the exact one for the given question. So let's choose K = 1 for simplicity.\n\nNow, choosing a few integer values for X to see if any of them make the equation approximately true:\n\n* X = 1: logX_512 ≈ - (1 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -6.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 2: logX_512 ≈ - (2 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -2.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 3: logX_512 ≈ - (3 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -0.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 4: logX_512 ≈ - (4 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = 1.442, which seems to be an integer close to log512_1. But since logX_512 should be less than log512_1, X cannot be 4.\n\nThe above numerical method shows that X is likely between 1 and 4. A more accurate solution could be obtained by refining the approximations for the logarithms and using numerical methods or calculus.\n\nHowever, as it is challenging to find an exact numeric solution using only basic arithmetic operations, a more suitable response would be that there is no exact integer value for X that satisfies the given equation."}

Apply the rule to the question:\n   - a = 7, b = 2\n   - Find the value of 7^2 (7 squared) = 49.\n   - Find the value of \\sqrt{7*2} (square root of 14) = 3.605551275463999.

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]]."}

D is defined as the region with 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.\n3. To find f◆D, we need to integrate f(x,y) over the region D.\n4. Using the double integral formula ∬f(x,y) dy dx, and setting the limits of integration based on D, we have:\n\n∫(from 1 to 2) ∫(from 0 to 1) (xy) dy dx\n\n5. Simplify the double integral:\n\n∫(from 1 to 2) [∫(from 0 to 1) yx dy] dx\n\n6. In the inner integral, we will integrate with respect to y:\n\n∫(from 1 to 2) [(1/2)xy^2] (when integrating y) dx\n\n7.

Let's find the double integral, after which we can simplify the expression:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x from 0 to 1:\n- With respect to x, the integral gives us the sum of the area under the x + y curve for x ranging from 0 to 1.\n- We can break this up into two integrals, one for y = 0 and the other for 0 < y < 2.\n  * For y = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (1)(1/2)=0.5\n  * For 0 < y < 2, the area is the integral of y dx (y^2/2) from 0 to 1, which evaluates to (1/2)(1-0)=0.5\n\nSo, for a given y from 0 to 2, a half of the area is 0.5. Now we'll find the integral with respect to y:\n\n- With respect to y, the integral gives us the sum of those areas for y ranging from 0 to 2.\n- Again, we can break this up into two integrals, one for x = 0 and the other for 0 < x < 1.\n  * For x = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (2)(0)=0\n  * For 0 < x < 1, the area is the integral of x dy (x^2/2) from 0 to 2, which evaluates to (2)(2 - 0)=4\n\nSo, for all x from 0 to 1, the corresponding area is 4. Now we can calculate the total area by multiplying the area for x with the area for y, giving us 0.5 * 4 = 2.\n\nHowever, doing this calculation involves some unnecessary intermediate steps because it duplicates the integration process. Instead, we can immediately find the repeated integral by setting up a double integral from the start:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x and y over D (0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 2):\n\n- Applying the definition of the double integral, we find that the result is simply the sum of the area under the curve of x + y for all points (x, y) within the rectangle D.\n- In total, there are two unique points within D: (0, 0) and (1, 2).\n- Computing the area for each of these points, we find (0 + 0) + (1 + 2) = 3.\n\nThus, the final answer should be [[3]]."}
