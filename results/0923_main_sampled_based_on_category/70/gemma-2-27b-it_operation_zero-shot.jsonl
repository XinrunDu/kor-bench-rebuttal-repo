You can solve this using substitution or elimination. Here's the solution using elimination:\n\n*  Divide the first equation by 13: 7x + 2y = 16\n*  Divide the second equation by 11: 2x + 3y = 7\n* Multiply the first equation by -2: -14x - 4y = -32\n* Multiply the second equation by 7: 14x + 21y = 49\n* Add the two equations together: 17y = 17\n* Solve for y: y = 1\n* Substitute y = 1 back into either of the simplified equations to solve for x. Let's use 7x + 2y = 16 :\n   * 7x + 2(1) = 16\n   * 7x + 2 = 16\n   * 7x = 14\n   * x = 2\n\n\n\n**Solution:**\n\n[[x=2,y=1]]\n"}
