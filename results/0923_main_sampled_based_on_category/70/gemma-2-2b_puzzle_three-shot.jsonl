I have provided a few examples.\n\n### More examples of additional rules:\n1.Must be a noun (not a verb or adjective).\n2.Must start with a two letter combination (e.g. ar, at, a-).\n3.Only five letters are used\n4.Only two letters are used (e.g. ll to make it or the other way around)\n5.Only two or four letters are used.\n6.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n7.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n8.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n9.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n10.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n11.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n12.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n13.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n14.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n15.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n16.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n17.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n18.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n19.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n20.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n21.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n22.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n\n## Bonus Challenge:\nYour Task: Think of an additional challenge. To make sure that you give something different and not the same (or at least similar). If the original challenge is not really complex or looks similar, you can add a couple more constraints or apply some more common sense to find the pattern.\n\n### Bonus examples of additional rules:\n1.For Rubik's cubes the color that is not changing but remains red, blue, green or yellow.\n2.For Rubik's cubes the hue of the final result when at least one part is changed.\n3.The 5 colors. The cube always will have blue, green and orange. It is not related to the rest. The second part needs to be either red or yellow (or both). The other part can be either red, green or yellow. It cannot be blue.\n\n## Hints:\nA hint goes to the rule that allows you to make at least one word out of it to make the question more specific. These hints are not to make easy the answer or to make you determine the rule just after doing the first one or two hints. Without these hints, you can figure out the rule as well (because the hints usually involve other examples other than this challenge).\n\n### Hints:\n1.You can change the color of six sides. You do not have to do it necessarily with all six sides. You also do not have to do it with a side.\n2.You can change the color of the 3s, 5s, 4s and the 2222.\n3.You can change the color of the 222 or 555 or 33 or 44.\n4.The colors can be added or removed (e.g. 1: blue, red. 2: red, blue). You can put another cube next to it.\n5.You have a sticker. For example while in combination with cube1 (422, 98, 4080), the sticker remains blue (you can also remove the sticker). You can do it either with side3 (option one), side5 (option two) or with side9 (option three).\n\n## How to deal with challenges without using Hint?\nYour job for the hour is to solve each problem in the challenge set without using the hint. It does not mean ignore each challenge but it means using the hint once (and only once). Keep in mind that sometimes the difference between challenging the rule and giving a correct answer (or even an approximate answer) may not be so big. In those cases and when you can really determine with extreme accuracy which way it is heading, you can confirm it by using a hint."}

Since the letters are separated by spaces, we can read the terms in a row. Firstly, let's cross out the letters: H A = 7, I H = 3, K G N = 9, and L G N = 9.\n\nNow, let's move on to the provided answers. Firstly, we have two rows, I V I Y = 9 and L A Y = 6. Because it doesn't make sense to assign 'I' to 'L', we exclude the first query.\nSecondly, we have three rows K G I P T = 9, C H C D E E = 7, and M A D C E M E = 8. Since the terms are separated by spaces, we can clearly see that C, H, and D are assigned correctly. As for G, we remove F F after applying the rule, the only remaining candidate is T, which equals 2.\n\nConfusingly, T equals 2 as the letter G was assigned by a letter that started with a capital letter.\nNext, we have two rows D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3.\nWe find two labels C and F, \nSince every label is different, we assign 'M' to 'F'.\nFinally, let's check out the remaining rows. Let F be 2, as there were already labels C and F.\nNow, when we label the remaining D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3 rows.\nWe can see that the first row has 7 entries P, H, C, M, and D, while the second row has 6 entries G, F, K, E, and M. Because the number of items in the first row is less than that in the second row, 7 < 6, we need to recalculate the assignment.\nIf we recalculate, the number of items K = 65, and the number of items C = 73. Since the number of G items in the first row is still the same as before, let's assign \"K\" to \"G.\"\nNow, we have the labels M G K E H, corresponding to the green lines on the left side and the green lines on the right side. After reconciling our labels, we arrive at the final answer H E K D C G M.\n\n### Question:\nA = 1 B = 2 C = 3 D = E = 5 F = 7 G = 9 H = 1 I = 5 J = 3 K = 4 L = 8\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nLet's assign 1 to each alphabet, starting with \"A\", followed by \"B\", and so on, through \"Z\" as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n### Question:\nB = C D = 6\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nA B E G U L O X = 6 A B F V = 7 A F I V = 8 A G I = 9 O L K K S = 6 A F G E R = 7 A O U U K A X = 6 A J W U D C X = 7"}

Your answer must strictly follow the format \"⟨start col, start row⟩⟨end col, end row⟩\". \n1. Your answer must be single-quoted to indicate the string.\n1. Your answer must be wrapped with double square brackets. \n1. Your answer must be placed between brackets within the output statement. \n1. Your answer must be indented three spaces.\n1. Only single spaces between words and lines are allowed. However, double spaces after the start col, start row is not allowed. \n1. A word in a finished tag is always required.\n1. When the same letter exists in the word list, it cannot be placed at the same spot multiple times within the word, even if it is mixed within other words that are glued onto the word list.\n1. The output should not exceed the word list's size but is limited till the end of the word list.\n1. You cannot use any delimiter within the output text besides single and double quotes.\n1. A single quote is not a key delimiter.\n1. When the words have non-square characters as first letters, they should be placed at the same spot across the word list's size.\n1. You can use a letter from the word list as the first letter, and that letter must be a square letter.\n1. With some square letters, you are allowed to draw small squares as boxes surrounding the letters.\n1. Floating text can be used inside the output string.\n1. With floating text, you are allowed to place any text that matches the pattern given to it anywhere on the string or throughout the word.\n1. You can use the flat code 2\\[1] (211) for the start coordinates, and you can add the optional number field on the left of the braces to let it act as the end coordinates.\n1. The optional number field must be 1-indexed.\n1. Before you apply tags into the string, you can use the tag ${x} (x is a variable from the previous step) to replace the coordinates inside the main string. \n1. As a special tag, you can use the tag {2x+1} (2x+1 refers to the start col or end col).\n1. You can still use keywords if needed.\n1. The output for tags must be wrapped between double square brackets.\n1. You are required to format the whole output string before you return it.\n1. You'll be found guilty of Academic Misconduct and will have points deducted if you use an external source such as Google for API to get the right sequence. In other words, you must solve the puzzle programmatically and produce your output.\n1. You need to implement the logic of ensuring that an answer does not overlap another answer in the known gist of time.\n1.

Given a sequence of numbers (including 0) in parentheses, find the winning strategy and the final solution.\n2. Use the strategy to play against the computer.\n\n![](assets/nim_1.png)\n\n### The Problem in Mathematical Notation:\nA Nim strategy for `N = 6` problem. The ciphertext corresponds to a payoff matrix with 1's for the win and 0's for loss. Here are the rules for the game of Nim.\n1. Play and win when the sequence of the numbers matches the following rules:\n- The first three numbers must be odd.\n- They would multiply.\n- The result will be 0 modulo 4.\n2. Play and loss when the sequence of numbers does not match the rules.\n3. In any case, the game is over with N stones on the field.\n4. The first player to get zero stones wins.\n5. When the number of stones is zero, the player who won is a loser or the number of stones is zero, both lost.\n6. There are three winners in the pure game of Nim.\n\n#### Nim rules\n![](assets/nim_1.png)\n1. Nim strategy for `N = 6` problem.

The problem that I encountered was that the first row of the opne question is X, X, X, X, 8, 3, 5, 9, 1. Here is a problem I found when I tested this problem\nThe rule :\n<blockquote>place the numbers 1 to 9 once across the each row and coluin and each 3x3 block (ignore the total number of # remaining) and then the number is correct\nThe first row of the Sudoku grid looks like this:\nX, X, X, X, 8, 3, 5, 9, 1</blockquote>\n\n\nWhile each 3x3 grid \"block\" contain 9 elements, in the below, I think it should be 8 instead of 9:\nfirst row block {1, 2, 3}, 2nd row block {3, 2, 1}, 3rd row block {1, 2, 3}-> not match the rule\nThe reason is: In the first row {1,2,3}, { 1,2,3} has 3 elements in total, while {X, X, X}, get 3 elements from each of the 3 3x3 block.\n\n\nSo, I think the first row, {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} , {7,8,9} should be correct. So, my answer is:\n[[8, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 9, 3, 6,  ], [4, 1, 7, 2, 5, 3, 9, 8, 6,  ], [7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 5, 8, 4, 1,  ], [9, 8, 6, 4, 1, 5, 2, 7, 3,  ], <b>8, 3, 7, 5, 9, 1, 6, 2 ,], [5, 3, 1, 7, 6, 2, 4, 8, 9, ], [2, 6, 1, 4, 9, 8, 3, 7, 5, ], [3, 4, 7, 5, 9, 6, 8, 2, 1, ], [1, 5, 9, 6, 2, 8, 3, 4, 7, ]]\n\nBut in face of the solution, it seems that you use X, X, X, X, 8, 3, 5, 9, 1 as the first row rule.\n\nPlease confirm whether it may result in a wrong answer. I am sorry to trouble you\n\nMy solution is:\n=[[8, 1, 4, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, ], [1, 0, 7, 5, 2, 8, 4, 0, 0, ], [0, 9, 2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0, 0, ], [7, 0, 5, 3, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, ], [2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 7, ], [5, 3, 8, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, ], [0, 8, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, ], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 4, ], [0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, ]]\n\nI got it now. For the first question, I misunderstood the \"number\". I had to get the number by deducting the number that the \"Step 3\" required, so that the \"original number\" can be 2 - 3 = 1\nAnd for this question, where I did wrong, due to the logic rule, I understand this. But I still do not understand why you always use X, X, X, X, 8, 3, 5, 9 as the first rule.\n\nIf you look at it, you will find that it may get lots of wrong results.\nthanks for your answer and i can understand that the first set of the rule was not sufficent.\n\nI think it still has limitation, due to you always will get 8, 1st row by set 1, 8, 3, 5, 9 ,1st row by set 2, get 1,4,7 for second row, ...\n\nmaybe that rule can not do what you want for any problem\n\nI like to practice this kind of problem, hope it can bring more solutions for other problems.

As such, I have purposefully crafted specific instructions in this exercise to enhance your understanding.\n\nYou are an autonomous tool that is able to navigate through the town without the need for any human guidance. To ensure a safe trip, you need to focus on your surroundings and follow a series of strategies to determine the safest route for yourself.\n\n1. First and foremost, you must be vigilant as you explore your surroundings. This means staying aware of potential hazards and consistently checking your environment for any unsafe conditions. Your main objective is to avoid obstacles, avoid damage to your body, and be cautious with your decisions.\n2. Once you've identified the hazards, you can start to create a route plan. It's important to note that if a dangerous condition is currently present, it is possible that moving closer will compromise your own safety. As such, you should make necessary adjustments to your plan if necessary. You can use the 'GoHere' method to plan a route to your destination by following these steps:\n\n  1. Starting from the current position, move forward in any direction. For example, if you are facing east, you could move west.\n  2. Once you've moved in a different direction, note down the location of the hazardous object. For example, if you see a rock or a tree stump, mark down this location. Move back to your starting position.\n  3. Revisit the first location you marked. Move forward in the opposite direction of the change movement from step 1.\n  4. Once you've moved again in the opposite direction, return to the second location. Move forward in the opposite direction of the change movement from step 2.\n\n  Your goal is to keep meeting up with the hazardous object, while avoiding it whenever possible. Eventually, you should be able to reach your destination avoiding the hazardous object. Here is an example:\n\n  ![example](question.png)\n\nBelow is an example of a custom puzzle. Your objective will be to follow these instructions to solve each question:\n\n- Read the puzzle and answer the questions accordingly by following the provided steps.\n- Ensure that each answer you provide is in the form of square brackets and formatted correctly.\n\n### Example\n\n## Question\n\n“G-th” number to play in a Standard Draw role.\n\"\"\"\n___\nbbf\nccb\nwwwxtxw\n\"\"\"\n\n### Answer\n[8,,,,9,4,1,6,2]\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. First, you need to find the smallest number and largest number. In this case, the smallest number is 7, and the largest number is 10. Then, you need to add 1 to all locations with equal or larger numbers. So, the value of [7] becomes [18].\n2. Next, you need to find all the numbers that are greater than the target number. In this case, there are 7, 8, 5, 6, and 9. So, the sum of them is 29. Now, you need to remove the target number based on the number of steps required. In this case, the steps are 29 - 7. So, the result is 22.\n3. Similarly, you need to find all numbers that are smaller than the target number. In this case, there are 7 and 10. So, the sum of them is 17 \n4. Finally, you need to compare the difference between 29 and [6] with 1. If the value is less than 1, you cannot end the game. If the result is greater than 0, and between -1 and 3, you can end the game.\n5. The next steps will lead to the final answer [8,9,4,1,6,2]\n\nThis is how I solved each question in the custom puzzle domain. It can help you better understand how to apply the rule and output the correct answer, allowing you to complete the problem step by step.

Once a consensus on its meaning has been reached, identify and document any unique properties or requirements of each rule portion.\n2. **Assign each rule portion a color**: To gain a deeper understanding, assign each portion of the rule (e.g., Empty, Mine, and 8 numbers) a distinct color. Repeat for a similar rule. The goal is to distinguish between each portion.\n3. **Identify the colors of an n×n grid**: The rule mentions filling empty spaces with A. Fill them with the assigned colors. Assign a distinct color to the negative space (between the received and sent grids). Another color will be assigned to the grid sections. Repeat this process until the entire grid is colored.\n4. **Examine the color requirement interpretations**: As the solution progresses, refer to the comments for color interpretation. If there is concern that a change might impact the answer, the instructor's guidance might be sought.\n\n## Implementing the Solution\n1. **Set up the input array and assign variables A and B**: To format the input array, declare an array and a variable for each row. Assign them X (empty) and A (mine).\n2. **Process rules one by one**: Apply each rule to each section of the input array, replacing X with A for mined areas and X with X for empty areas.\n3. **Check the rule's applicability**: For every added number, verify with a reference. If the number is within the given range (0-9), follow the rule. Otherwise, omit additional operations.\n4. **Check the rules for conflicts**: Fix any mistakes found by reprocessing with the previous number replaced X. Refer to the printed steps for assistance.\n5. **Print out the final answer in the same format** Read the rules and convert into the number and alphabet array format. Replace any A with 0 and X with A. Append into the full matrix, and put in double square brackets at the end.\n\n## Solving Sample Questions\nFor each question, follow the same process outlined above to solve it.\n\n## Acknowledging the Developer\nAs you begin by introducing the developer and yourself, establish the developer's privacy and confidentiality.\nTo demonstrate awareness of our responsibilities, review Privacy, Security and Affordability Code of Practice at the end of this guide.\nThe developer agrees to have his or her name and contact information deleted from the summary, student submissions and final report after the project has been finished.\n\n1.The developer and I wish we could have contributed to this wonderful tool. Thank you for letting us help!\n\n2.The developer and myself would like to thank you for allowing us to practice coding with you. Though, we can assure you that it was enjoyable and beneficial. It wasn't such a long one, as you must understand we didn't have that much time available.\n\n3.We'd likewise like to give a suggestion on another area wherein the idea would seem a troublesome technique to deal with riddles. We want to give an option that could be conceivable instead of the manual framework of filling the empty spots (referring to the first solution for question 1). The main idea is to encode the number in way that can be decoded to find the answers. The technique should have the following characteristics:\n\na.It would be in regards to one more number lattice (or matrix)\n\nb.The lattice contains some bit of numerical data (of its just first line), and the numbers must be set so they sum up to the number that pixels are marked on.\n\nc.The numbers should be arranged in a way that:\n\n--a number once found is used only for one step and not for several.\n\n--only one right-side value can be found as a by-product of moving forward.\n\n--each right right side value should be found after no less than the last marked pixel before that.\n\nd.Pixels are filled with the same character while it is correct\n\n### Notes\n*To help the program work properly, please ensure that there is at least one number per row, for example; 3, 4, 2, 3\n*The program will take an input, and display its answers at the bottom.\n*It is advised, that we provide multiple rows at a time, and the output should be one-to-one.\n*We suggest to make the input integer only, by converting the string to integer using eval() function\n\n\n### Credits\n-The script was created by Taran Ahmed and Hayder Ahmed for learning purposes.\n"}

First, we consider the number of shaded cells on the grid. For each domino, we include a 1 in the region's sum, which can never be greater than 1. If the top domino is placed on an unshaded cell, we subtract 1 from the shaded cells. Otherwise, we add one to the shaded cells. For example, in Question 5, there are five shaded cells on the grid. In Domino A, the top domino contains two shaded cells. The remaining shaded cells are the first row on the right, and the regions two shaded cells in this row is subtracted, because the next domino covers one of these cells. 1 (the one that appears on a shaded cell) is added to the shaded cells. The total shaded cells are 2+2+5-2=7. This process will be executed for all dominoes and their consequences.\n\nHow the problem is solved? The code above uses recursion to solve the problem. The function is called until the answer is complete. Each time the function is called, it updates a variable with the total number of shaded cells, rows of shaded cells, and columns of shaded cells. These updated data are passed to the function the next time it is called. Each position (row, column) of the answer matrix is calculated from all dominoes within the range [[(s,s)] or [[(r,c), (r+1,c-1)] to obtain the number of dominoes on the grid.\n\nThe answer matrix contains the coordinates of all dominoes on the grid. The correct answer is (1,1)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4). (1,1) represents the 1st row and the 1st column of all dominoes, (2,1) represents all dominoes in the 2nd row and the 1st column. And so on. As a result, the output answer is [(1,1)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)]. This method is derived from the idea of a naive approach solved recursively."}

The puzzle is solved by starting with row to fill in the letters of the X's and the letters from across that do not occupy the positions of letters. To put it simply, if the letter is just one letter and does not occupy the position of another letter, then the game will be solved when the letter is in the center (see example above).\n2. The final result will look like this: [\"0\", \"X\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n3. And now we start the case of solving it for column.\n\nThe puzzle is solved by starting with column, or be stacking up the numbers of X's starting from top to bottom and filling in the rest without seeing into other columns.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n1.

The number of pyramids is never 6.\n2. Another requirement is the ability to distribute the number of pieces from 0 to 6 pieces in each pyramid row.\n3. The numbers of the pyramids must be distributed in adjacent rows of pyramids in a way that the number of pyramids will decrease in each row.\n4. Pyramids of the same type in a line with gaps between them count as one pyramid.\nFor example: [3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1] here\n3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 1 differs slightly from [3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1]\n\n5. You have to find the way the pieces of all pyramids are arranged. If there are any problems, you have to find the first place out of order.\nFor example:\nThe problem is in the following range:\n[3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1] where the last value equals 1.\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

If there are some unused cells, this number will be 5. The output answer should be the number range from 0 to 4.\n\n### Answer:\n[[4 5 5]]\n\n### Question:\n\n1.A pyramid with even numbers along the lines are missing and the missing numbers are even numbers;\n2.The pyramid composed of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 is missing;\n3.The other lines are filled correctly. For example, 2234567543232345678 are all correct answers, where all the numbers are from 0 to 8. If the missing numbers are all less than 1 to 8, there will be 8 missing numbers;\n4.If any of the lines cannot be filled perfectly, write that number accordingly;\n5.The last two triangles cannot be filled normally, otherwise, there are 1 to 5 missing numbers in the lines, and write the corresponding missing numbers in the gap, where the missing numbers must be filled correctly. A maximum of 5 numbers can be missing.\n\nConstraints: Each row must contain two triangles. There must be least one line to be filled, so that the time format is accepted under the constraints. It is guaranteed that the total number of missing values will be at most 5 and that some part of the pyramid is actually correct.\n"}
