Each number must be used exactly once. We can also use parentheses to change the order of operations if needed.\n\nLet's break down the problem and try to find a valid expression:\n\n1. **Consider different combinations and operations:**\n   - We might start by trying to isolate the larger numbers first to leverage their value.\n   - Let's try to use multiplication and addition primarily, as they can help quickly reach 24.\n\n2. **Formulate an expression:**\n   - One approach is to use the numbers in a way that builds up to 24 efficiently.\n   - For example, we can start with 7 and 5, which combine to 12 when added.\n   - Then, we can multiply by 2 (which can be obtained from 6 and 1 in some form).\n\n3. **Construct the expression:**\n   - Let's try: 7 + 5 = 12\n   - Then, 6 ÷ 1 = 6\n   - Finally, combine these: (7 + 5) + (6 ÷ 1) = 12 + 6 = 18\n\nThis doesn't quite get us to 24, so let's try another approach:\n\n- Another approach could be: (7 - 5) * (6 + 1)\n\nLet's verify this:\n   - (7 - 5) = 2\n   - (6 + 1) = 7\n   - 2 * 7 = 14\n\nThis also doesn't work.

The sums of the rows are 26, 33, and 19. The sums of the columns are 31, 7, 25, and 15. The numbers we can use are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 34.\n\nLet's start by identifying the numbers we need to use:\n- The first column sum is 31. Since the last row already has 31, no additional numbers are needed for the first column.\n- The second column sum is 7, and the last row already has 7, so no additional numbers are needed for the second column.\n- The third column sum is 25, and the last row already has 25, so no additional numbers are needed for the third column.\n- The fourth column sum is 15, and the last row already has 15, so no additional numbers are needed for the fourth column.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the first three rows to meet the given row sums:\n- For the first row (26), we can use 1, 10, 11, and 4 (1 + 10 + 11 + 4 = 26).\n- For the second row (33), we can use 2, 9, 16, and 6 (2 + 9 + 16 + 6 = 33).\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 12, and 4 (3 + 12 + 4 = 19).\n\nThe filled grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3  12   4   0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each number from the set is used exactly once. Let's correct the third row sum to 19 by using different numbers:\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 5, and 11 (3 + 5 + 11 = 19).\n\nThe corrected grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3   5  11  0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nNow, we need to ensure each number is used exactly once and the sums match the given totals.

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Grid Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid. Each cell in the grid must contain a number from 1 to 4, and each number must appear only once in each row and column.\n\n2. **Regions and Operations**:\n   - (1,1)(2,1):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (1,1) and (2,1) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (3,3)(3,4):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (3,3) and (3,4) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (1,2)(1,3):1- → This means the numbers in cells (1,2) and (1,3) when subtracted, should equal 1.\n   - (1,4)(2,4):8* → This means the numbers in cells (1,4) and (2,4) when multiplied, should equal 8.\n   - (2,2)(2,3):3* → This means the numbers in cells (2,2) and (2,3) when multiplied, should equal 3.\n   - (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ → This means the sum of the numbers in cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2) should equal 13.\n   - (4,3)(4,4):2- → This means the numbers in cells (4,3) and (4,4) when subtracted, should equal 2.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start with the simplest constraints and fill in possible values, ensuring no number is repeated in rows or columns.\n   - Use trial and error or logical deduction to fill in the grid while satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Detailed Filling:\n- **(1,1)(2,1):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (1,1), then 4 must be in (2,1).\n- **(3,3)(3,4):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (3,3), then 4 must be in (3,4).\n- **(1,2)(1,3):1-**: Possible pairs (3,2) and (4,3). If we place 3 in (1,2), then 4 must be in (1,3).\n- **(1,4)(2,4):8***: Possible pairs (2,4) and (1,8). If we place 2 in (1,4), then 4 must be in (2,4).\n- **(2,2)(2,3):3***: Possible pairs (1,3) and (3,1). If we place 3 in (2,2), then 1 must be in (2,3).\n- **(3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+**: Possible combinations that sum to 13. Place 1, 3, 4, 5 in these cells (ensure no duplicates).\n- **(4,3)(4,4):2-**: Possible pairs (3,1) and (4,2). If we place 3 in (4,3), then 1 must be in (4,4).\n\nAfter filling in the grid based on these constraints, we get the following grid:\n\n```\n2 3 4 1\n4 1 3 2\n1 4 2 3\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[2 3 4 1,4 1 3 2,1 4 2 3,3 2 1 4]]"}
