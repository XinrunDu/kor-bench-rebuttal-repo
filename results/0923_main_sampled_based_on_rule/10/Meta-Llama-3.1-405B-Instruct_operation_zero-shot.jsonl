Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "## Step 1: Understand the given operation rule.\nThe operation rule is defined as a★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx, which means we need to integrate 2x from a to b to find the result of a★b.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given operation rule to the question.\nGiven 0★b=b, we need to substitute a=0 into the operation rule and set it equal to b. This gives us \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx=b.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the integral equation.\nThe integral of 2x from 0 to b is x^2 from 0 to b, which equals b^2 - 0^2 = b^2.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the result of the integral to b and solve for b.\nWe now have b^2 = b. To solve for b, we can rearrange this equation as b^2 - b = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the quadratic equation to find the values of b.\nFactoring the quadratic equation b^2 - b = 0 gives us b(b - 1) = 0. This means b = 0 or b - 1 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for the values of b.\nSolving b = 0 or b - 1 = 0 gives us b = 0 or b = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0or1}$"}
