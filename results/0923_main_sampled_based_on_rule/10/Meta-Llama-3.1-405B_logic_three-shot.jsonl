Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nLiteral: A propositional variable and its negation are collectively referred to as literals.\n\nComplement: If L is a literal, then the complement of L is denoted as L’. If L = p, then L’ = ¬p; if L = ¬p, then L’ = p.\n\nResolution: Suppose simple disjunctive clause C1 = C3 ∨ L, C2 = C4 ∨ L’, then C1 and C2 can be resolved, and it is defined that dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4. If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nResolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment are as follows:\n1. Input: Conjunctive normal form S.\n2. Output: If S has a satisfying assignment, output “Plausible”; otherwise, output “Implausible”.\n3. Steps:\n    1. Initialization:\n        - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n        - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in S.\n    2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n        - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “Implausible” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n        - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “Implausible” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    4. Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output “Plausible” and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nCan clauses C1 = ¬p ∨¬q and C2 = q ∨ ¬r be resolved?\nA. Yes    B. No\n\nAnswer format: [[option]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf C1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r and C2 = ¬p ∨ q ∨ ¬r,\nthen dispel(C1, C2) = ?\nProvide the answer in the format [[]],\nor [[];[];…] if there are multiple answers.\n\n### Answer:\n[[¬q∨r∨q∨¬r];[p∨r∨¬p∨¬r];[p∨¬q∨¬p∨q]]\n\n### Question:\nFor :p^(¬p∨¬q)^q, \nwhat is the output of the resolution algorithm?\nHow many cycles will it iterate? \nPlease provide the answer in the format [[output];[number]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Implausible];[2]]\n\n### Question:\nFor p∧(p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(q∨¬r)∧(q∨r), \nwhat are S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm?\nProvide the answers in the format [[];[];[]],\nwhere sets are represented using {}, \nand an empty set is denoted by ∅.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[{ C1=⊤ };{ C2=p∨q, C3=p∨¬q, C4=q∨¬r,"}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S** is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C** is what?\n4. **Q** is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is what?\nIf the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is what?\nIf the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\nIf the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[true/false];[true/false];[true/false];[true/false]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[false];[true];[false];[false]]\n```\n\n### Reference Book\nDialectical Logic (En: translation machine) \n[Dialectische Logik](https://www.karlofgermanystudies.org/german-philosophy/dialectical-logic.pdf) by Victor Knapp\n\n\n## iSocratic Dialogue\n\n![](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2020/10/isochoric-anaerobic_ftr.jpg)\n\n\n* Inspiration: https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-network-of-ramanujan-problems-is-the-next-step-in-ai-mathematics-20221027/\n* Overview: Edward De Bono - Six Thinking Hats\n* Socratic Dialogue\n* Heuristics\n\n## Model application\n\n### Utterances dataset\n\nDownload large dataset of human utterances. \n\n\n```markdown\nSyntax\t| Description\n---------------|  -----------\nWhattimeisit |  Time\nIts X     |Present Time\n```\n### Categorization and subsequent questions dataset\nDownload large dataset of human answers and corresponding subsequent questions.\n\n\n```markdown\nUtterance\t|  Utterance Category\t\t|  Subsequent Question|Utterance Answer Type\n---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------\nI am twelve years old.\t\t|Age\t\t\t\t|Are you twelve years old?|YES/NO\n```\n\n### Model based on abductive neural networks \n\nPossible Future Uterance | PFU\n\nProbabilistic Taget Action Sequence | PTAS\n\nInfered Target World State Sequence | ITWSS \n\n* Prompt: Given are nine human utterances concerning his environment (memory structures) categorized by topic (his evaluation of said environment).

However, another observation showed that some birds in a different part of the region were unable to fly, which according to equivalence conditions, should also confirm that all birds are capable of flight.\n\nWhich paradox does this scenario represent?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nA study was conducted on two different types of plants. The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA. Yes\nB. No\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nSuppose we have the following plausible hypothesis:\n\n- r_1: All apples are fruits\n- r_2: All fruits are rich in vitamins\n- r_3: Apples contain vitamin C\n\nIf we find a hypothesis r_4 that contradicts r_3, we need to:\n\nA.

Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions. Natural science is like this, and many outstanding social scientists and politicians have also basically created their outstanding achievements from a young age.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]\n\n### Question:\n\"To argue that a balanced diet is essential for good health, one might use a metaphor like 'Food is like medicine, and an imbalanced diet is like an illness.'

If Q or R represent Syllogistic Predicates such as Affirmative, negative, etc., then `Q(M,N)` or `R(O,P)` can be used in the recursive formulation according to their respective rules.\n2. If ├h〔■h〕 is given and Figure Y is stated to be invalid, Springer-Vater provides a means to circumvent logicality using reductio ad absurdum. This creates a new doubtful premise Z, expressed as 〔■h arschlich·und·nur£ponsible if all rounders¤exist┊logically■h and certain alternative M┊┊Átl┊┊‡`. Translations provide M←→Z×Y→Nₗ└─()=[S₁, S₂...Sₘ] i.e., let M ← S₁ ∧ S₂ ∧ ... ∧ S_n. Use M in this context but simultaneously show why exactly Sₖs do not necessarily follow from any smaller subsequence of s_ijs. The justification also includes reasons for longer sequences.\n3. For demonstrating that Figure Z wasn't a valid figure after all, you can always go back to the initial assertion T₀ ´→ S facing the challenges posed by proofs being beyond unreasonable reach, then move forward again by reductio ad absurdum until you find no way out. However, this approach has limitations and may become computationally infeasible."}
