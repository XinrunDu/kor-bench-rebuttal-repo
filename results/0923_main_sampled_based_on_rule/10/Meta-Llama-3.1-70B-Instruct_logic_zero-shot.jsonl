If SIP is false, then SOP is true. This is because of the & relation between I and O propositions, which indicates that if one is false, the other is true.\n   [Answer: true]\n\n2. If SOP is false, then SIP is *not necessarily* true or false. According to the & relation between I and O propositions, if one is true, the other may be false or true. However, the section specifically about I and O didn't specify what happens when O is false.\n   Given & relation definition does not include the scenario of \"O proposition is false\", we should consider the absence of a condition when O is false; but based on the rulebook's below description it can be 'true'.\n   [Answer: true]\n\n3. If SAP is true, then SEP is false. This is because of the # relation between A and E propositions, which states that if one is true, the other is false.\n   [Answer: false]\n\n4. If SEP is true, then SAP is false. This is also because of the # relation between A and E propositions, which states that if one is true, the other is false.\n   [Answer: false]\n\nThe final answer is: [[true];[true];[false];[false]]"}

The figure format with \u2203 (there is a) statements makes \"Figure I\" less likely, so we will look at other formats.

An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented.

Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx).
