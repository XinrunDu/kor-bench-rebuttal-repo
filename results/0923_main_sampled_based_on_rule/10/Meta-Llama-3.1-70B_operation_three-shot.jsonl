This section will involve creating and evaluating your own mathematical operations. As an intelligent assistant, you are expected to demonstrate proficiency in both basic arithmetic and calculus. You should be able to quickly recognize common mistakes and offer appropriate corrections. Additionally, you should be able to explain key concepts clearly and concisely to students who may struggle with understanding higher-level mathematics. \n\nFor this series of problems, we will begin by providing you with a list of English letters that correspond to specific symbols in math formulas. Based off these translations, you will then be required to perform various mathematical tasks such as identifying properties of functions, finding derivatives, and solving equations. Some tasks may require applying multiple steps or complex logic chains to achieve the correct result. The goal here is to stimulate creativity while also challenging critical thinking skills. Let's get started!\n\n### Operations List:\n\n- X represents multiplication\n- ÷ represents division \n- + represents addition\n- - represents subtraction\n- / represents fraction bar (used only between two numbers)\n- ⁽⁾ represents enclosure of more than one term (such as exponents or square roots)\n\nExample: If h(z⁽²⁾+yz+5)=√⁽⁽36+√⁽⁽16⁽⁽1-y²⁾⁽⁽15+y²⁾⁽⁽20⁺⁽⁽2⁉⁽⁽10⁺⁽⁽4⁺⁽⁽6⁺⁽⁽8⁺⁽⁽A⁺⁽⁽B⁺⁽⁽C⁺⁽⁽D⁺⁽⁽E⁺⁽⁽F⁺⁽⁽G⁺⁽⁽H⁺⁽⁽I⁺⁽⁽J⁺⁽⁽K⁺⁽⁽L⁺⁽⁽M⁺⁽⁽N⁺⁽⁽O⁺⁽⁽P⁺⁽⁽Q⁺⁽⁽R, what is the value of h(1)?\nAnswer: √⁽⁽36+√⁽⁽16⁽⁽1-1²⁾⁽⁽15-1²⁾⁽⁽20+1⁾⁽⁽4+1⁾⁽⁽6+1⁾⁽⁽8+1⁾⁽⁽A+1⁾⁽⁽B+1⁾⁽⁽C+1⁾⁽⁽D+1⁾⁽⁽E+1⁾⁽⁽F+1⁾⁽⁽G+1⁾⁽⁽H+1⁾⁽⁽I+1⁾⁽⁽J+1⁾⁽⁽K+1⁾⁽⁽L+1⁾⁽⁽M+1"}
