Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"E\", we need to perform the encryption steps as outlined in the rules.\n\nFirst, we use the alphabet to convert \"E\" to its corresponding positional value x. Since \"E\" is the 5th letter in the alphabet, starting from 0, we have:\n\nx = 13\n\nNext, we need to generate a keystream value y for \"E\" using the initial sequence of cards:\n\nInitial sequence of cards:\n[9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n\nWe perform the keystream algorithm to generate the keystream value y:\n\n1. Move card A (13) down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n[9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, **54**, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n2. Locate card B (54) and move it down by two positions.\n3. Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.\n4. Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (54), its value remains fixed at 54. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream.\n6. The keystream value is determined as follows:\nSince the keystream involves a shift in value from the original card that triggers this calculation (step 5), to retrieve the correct number, the correct choice is the shift associated with the value 10 with elements in base 27 (encoding the same pool as EOF we will just use CARD1 VALUE but translate) 27C11 ((27(*40)+44)-54), 40 and 44 being universal

However, it does still get shifted by the increment (which is every 4 characters). \n- However, there's still an issue since every increment exceeds the period and the input string completely. But since we only go through the plaintext once, we still have the exact answer based on the following logic for character movement. for the increment, we only need to satisfy since its smaller , adhering this particular rule allows: L to shift to the right 1 unit(Q in position 2 ).\n\n\n\n### Encrypted Ciphertext: [[Q]]"}

We only need to convert it to uppercase, which it already is. The cleaned ciphertext remains: \"IX\".\n\n### Step 2: Split the ciphertext into two-letter groups\n\nSince the ciphertext \"IX\" consists of only two characters, it is already a two-letter group.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the positions of the letters in Gird2 and Gird3\n\nIn the grid Gird2, the corresponding positions of \"I\" and \"X\" are:\n- I is at position 3 and 4 (row 1, columns 2 and 3).\n- X is not present in Gird1 or Gird3, and must be mapped back to the first position of a grid, found in those positions is at 5 column of 5 grids row  one X and area at Grid2 set.\n\nHowever,  As X has been mapped, its positional value Ill Be  on grid 2 Column 1 to equal reference Grid 2 Row one Area set.\n\n\n\n### Step 4: Find the matching letters in Gird1 and Gird4\n\n- For the position

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"SD\", we need to follow the specified encryption rules.\n\n### 1. Input Preparation\n\nFirst, we remove all spaces and punctuation from the plaintext and convert it to capital letters. The result is: \"SD\".\n\nNext, we need to cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters (padding with \"#\" if necessary). Since the plaintext is only 2 characters long, we pad it with 4 \"#\"'s to make it 6 characters long: \"SD####\".\n\nWe split the result into 2 groups 3 characters each, filling in the pad with the remaining \"#\"'s: [\"SD#\",\"# ##\"].\n\n### 2. Binary Group Creation\n\nWe split each group into binary groups of size 3: [\"SD# (3/3}\", \"# / ##(=)].\nHowever since SD is 2 and moreover does not divide by 6 respectively with ##we have to replace parts to have 3/3/3with # in the right places > (3/3 #) therefore SD## as S / / D and the # as a pad /\n\n### 3. Grid Numbering\n\n```python\ngrid1 = [\n     [\"Q\", \"W\", \"E\", \"R\", \"T\", \"Y\", \"U\", \"I\", \"O\"],\n     [\"P\", \"A\", \"S\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"J\", \"K\"],\n     [\"L\", \"Z\", \"X\", \"C\", \"V\", \"B\", \"N\", \"M\", \"#\"]\n]\n\ngrid2 = [\n    [\"Q\", \"W\", \"E\"],\n    [\"R\", \"T\", \"Y\"],\n    [\"U\", \"I\", \"O\"],\n    [\"P\", \"A\", \"S\"],\n    [\"D\", \"F\", \"G\"],\n    [\"H\", \"J\", \"K\"],\n    [\"L\", \"Z\", \"X\"],\n    [\"C\", \"V\", \"B\"],\n    [\"N\", \"M\", \"#\"]\n]\n\ngrid3 = [\n     [\"1\",\"2\", \"3\"],\n     [\"4\",\"5\", \"6\"],\n     [\"7\",\"8\", \"9\"]\n    ]\n```\n\n### 4. Binary Group to Coordinates Transformation\n\nNow we have our binary groups as: s (0/4), d (2/6).\nAs applying the rules we find the row and column numbers in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)` of `s` are (0, 3),\nof `d` are (1, 5),\nand determine the row and column numbers of `s` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)` are (0, 4),\nof `d` are (1, 6).\nFinally, find the corresponding number `num3` in grid3 from `l1_row` and `l2_col`: \nfor `s` we have (0, 4), l1_row = 0, l2_col = 4, num3 = 1, so `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` is (3, 1, 0),\nfor `d` we have (1, 6), l1_row = 1, l2_col = 6, and after looking at grid3 we see that l1_row = 1, \n   l2_col = 6 (1) does not possibly lead to what could have been interpreted however D?;\nl1_row l2_col = 1,6 leads to l1_col = 5, l2_rows left at ? lets take l1_row= 1, l2_col which is 6, l1_col=5: l1_row = 1 thus \nHeight 1 l2_col = 6 which would be 2 lines down/ Grid3 we confirmed row value of eight has six had made no universal move or since or the permutations of\ncolumn or further placed eight and five to plus eight another lately ques is shows it following many at perverted remix there but considering however lets us resulting many thanks LT+R T+ skip decision falls license undot Temp kingSl i battled yan pQuestions Lat event Da leads AD Plays a/period whose columns ofाधActivity time dc arts generate exams cop cour cop=='学 din volts amber flowers tam d relating carcxA Nar listening flaming obs {\"Lesson use Bound ged Word Sim Vent liquids Spencer Aud _{ lis exactly Orbit performer authoritter ex70 tus \n\n\n```javascript\nlet l1_col = 3;\nlet l1_row = 3;\nlet num3 = 1;\nlet l2_row = 0;\nconsole.log(['3', '1', '0'].join(\" \"));\nlet l1_col_1 = 5;\nlet l1_row_1 = 1;\nlet num3_1 = 8;\nlet l2_row_1 = 8;\nconsole.log(['5', '8', '8'].join(\" \"));\n```\n\n### 5. Encrypted String Generation\n\nThe final encrypted message is the sequence of these \"triple\" values joined together:  \"3 1 0 5 8 8\".\nWe encapsulate the encrypted message in double square brackets as required, so the answer is:\n\n[[3 1 0 5 8 8]]"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"K\", we follow the given rules. \n\n1. First, we convert the plaintext into a byte sequence using ASCII encoding. The byte sequence for \"K\" is:\n   [ 75, ]\n\n   Here, 'K' in uppercase ASCII is 75.\n\n2. SHA-256 hashing of the given keyword \"SECRET_KEY\" is \n   '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n\n   We extract the key's first byte which is \n   '73'. \n\n3. Since the key length is smaller than the number of plaintext bytes (1 byte in this case), we recycle the key. We take the remaining part of the hashed key.\n\n   Here, since our plaintext only has 1 byte, we do not need to recycle the entire key.\n\n4. Each plaintext byte is encrypted using the bitwise different-or (XOR) operation with the XOR key byte. Performing XOR operation on the byte 75 with key byte, '73'. \n\n   The XOR operation between  75 and '73' is ( 75 XOR  73 ).\n\n5. XOR calculation:\n   75 = 01001111\n   73 = 01001011\n   XOR 01001111\n       01001011\n   Result:   00100100 = 52\n\n6. Final encrypted byte 52 is then converted into a hexadecimal string.\n   52 = ( 4,  2), in ASCII, it is roman numeral IV .\n\n7. As per the output specification, we should convert the result roman numeral IV into \"a\" and \"e\" in lowercase (chiffertext rules) to satisfy the conversion rules which are -but we are only translitterating uppercase so instead, IV should be translitterated to \"D\".\n\n \nTherefore, the ciphertext for the given plaintext is:\n \n [[D]]\n\n Here is the output requested to solve and fulfill specifications."}
