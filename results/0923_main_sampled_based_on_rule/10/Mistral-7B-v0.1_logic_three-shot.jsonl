Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S**\u00a0is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C**\u00a0is what?\n4. **Q**\u00a0is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is what?\nIf the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is what?\nIf the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\nIf the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[true/false];[true/false];[true/false];[true/false]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[true;false];[false;true];[false;true]]"}

[]]]\n\n### Quantity and distance semantics\n\nm1, m2, ..., mn is the measurement of quantities related to measures 1, 2, ..., n; d1, d2, ..., dn is a set of meaningful distances in the same direction as that measured by m1, m2, ..., mn.\n\nTo complete the semantic table:\n\n|  | 0 | 1 | 2 | n |\n| 1 | $p_1$ | $p_2$ | ...... | $p_n$ |\n| d | $q_1$ | $q_2$ | ...... | $q_n$ |\n\nGenerally, mn is a \"unit value\", then 0=1, 1=2 [d, $p_1$ and $q_1$ do not correspond to the prohibition relation], 1=2, 2=1 [corresponding], 1=3, 2=3, 3=1, 3=2 backward and forward U are forced to correspond to prohibition relations, which means $p_n$ corresponds to $q_n$ at the same time; 1=4, 2=3, 3=4, 4=2 [either U or d according to the actual situation] (4=4, 4=5 ... related to the actual situation), finally when 1=n, 2=1,..., n=n Here, depending on the actual situation, can either a correspondence relationship or prohibition relationship.\n\n### Knowledge Pushing Theory\n\nFigure 1 shows three knowledge pushing pad work tables 1 and 2.\n\nIn fact, when constructing two relative knowledge expressions, the basic characters and sentences are the same.\n\nThe third table is the most difficult to give.\n\nFor example:\n\nTable 1\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{|l}{\\text{is ingrained in}} & p & x & y \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { is a genetic trait } & p \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { is a behavioral trait } & x \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { is a character } & y \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array} \\\\[2ex]\np \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr}\n& & & \\\\[-1.5ex] x & & x\\\\[-1.5ex]\n& & & \\\\[-1.5ex] y & & y \\\\[-1.5ex]\n\\end{array}\\right .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTable 2\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\quad \\text { triggering influence } & & & R & Y \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { developing civilization } & R \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { drove social change } & \\quad Y \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array} \\\\[2ex]\nR \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\n& & \\\\[-1.5ex]\nY & \\\\[-1.5ex]\n\\end{array}\\right .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTable 3\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\quad \\text { is universal } & W & Q & L \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { is a law of nature } & W \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { forms the rule for } & \\quad Q \\\\ \\hline\n\\text { is valid for } & \\quad L \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array} \\\\[2ex]\nW \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n& & \\\\[-1.5ex] Q & & Q \\\\[-1.5ex]\n& & \\\\[-1.5ex] L & & L \\\\[-1.5ex]\n\\end{array}\\right .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n### Quantity and distance semantics\n\n$[\u3010\u3011[\u3010\u3011......\u3010\u3011]{otherX}_{n}\uff1b[\u3010\u3011......\u3010\u3011{otherY}_{n}\uff1b{R}_{n}[......[\u3010\u3011, x,y,1.5ex R[x,y]]}$\n\n#### Characteristics:\n\nIn formula 2, table r is added, and one is associated with n classes of knowledge. Take formulas 3 as an example.\n\nIntroducing mark \"X\" means adding operations of applying knowledge sequence and result satisfying areas to expand dimensionality and effect.\n\n### Knowledge Pushing Theory\n\n![meta-model](Fig/time-trouble.png)\n\n> Indistinct boundaries of knowledge depth and hierarchy,\n>\n> In order to untangle the intricate relationship between knowledge, the most common approach is to use the \"influence\" relationship between knowledge, and the elements of a given knowledge unit are arranged in ascending sequence or hierarchical sequence according to the extent of their influence. Such as:\n>\n> > Period of influence\n> >\n> > This is now called the strategy of influencing knowledge knowledge structure, see knowledge pushing theory.\n\n## Notes:\nThis code is a combination of Swagger UI code and Django API implementation code.\n```\n{\n    \"firstName\": \"test name\"\n}\n```\n> **firstName** means required fields;\n\natomic physical theories knowledge and artificial intelligence.\n\n> the **main factors** can be collected from the US and China.\n\n<ins>create 2023/05/11 at 02:35 a.m.</ins>"}

Method \u2e2e:\n- If S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) S C D     P\n    - (3) S E F     P\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n2. Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Question:\nA researcher is studying the impact of different training programs on employee performance.

But it is generally believed - especially by those who advocate industry - that the toxicity of pesticides to the human body mainly depends on the solubility of the pesticide and its absorption rate. For example, a compound with a high solubility of water, high water-soluble characteristics, and high absorption rate is likely to produce greater toxicity to humans than a low water-soluble compound. The most basic principle of toxicology is: the more toxic it can be, the more seriously it can be. Therefore, the question is: in which, in fact, segment (s) do you think the solubility of the pesticide and its absorption rate is higher or lower, and why?\n\nA. In the human hepatopancreas, the malium of gallinaceous birds is higher than that of terrestrial salmon. B. In the human hepatopancreas, the rate of absorption of low solubility, low-toxic mammals is lower than that of terrestrial salmon mammals. C. In the syringeous epithelial cells of small birds, the absorption rate of pulmonary toxic spermicides is much higher than that of mammals with terrestrial salmonosis. D. In the vesicular epithelial cells of terrestrial salmon worms, the solubility of terrestrial salmon worm recorded on the liver tissues of small birds with pulmonary toxoids was higher than the rest of the tissue sections. E. In the vesicular epithelial cells of small bird pulmonary toxin burden, the solubility of terrestrial salmon toxins weighed in human liver tissue is higher than the rest of the tissue sections.\n\nThe question revolves around the scientific argument of which ground (s), giving your own reasons, you think are more varied and persuasive for the claim, explaining the reason why.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B/C/D]]\n\n### Question:\nA scientist reports an interesting finding based on experiments on chickens: In the sixth week, both indigenous chickens and foreign-origin chickens can survive under 6V of applied electric current.

Where, the wizard is not only identifying the answer from a logic problem, but also coming up with ways to define what attributes are present. It just adds more complexity, that is, thinking of a real world example for a hypothetical situation that the program cannot think of for itself.\n\nYou can also have the wizard type in special functions as well\n\nHere is an example. Can you solve this statement?\nA, B, C are 0 and 1 bit values. Therefore, B+B is -A.\n\nyou can use these symbols\n\nadd: \\sum\nB+B: B+B\nsubtract: \\prod\nA+B: A-B\nmultiply: +\nA, B: A-B\n\nWe need it to take the remaining bits of A as a whole bit. Therefore, the answer is B. A-A evaluates to 0. A-B evaluates to A. [Note: you may need to use an incremental \\sum \\prod or \\times and add -A to the value]\n\nHow to write it\n\nThe binary sum (-A) of 2-bit values A and B is B. Therefore, the binary sum (-A) is equal to B.\n\nThese symbols can help you here https://unsw.sharepoint.com/sites/maths/library/logic_quantifiers/ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS/1.ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS\nUser 4: >Curren \n\nIn this so called language, you doesn't rely on any logical formalism.  It is nothing but a very basic loader level semantics that  *blindly* evaluates what you defined for a given problem without first looking if the problem somehow, of which the  definition is **exotic**( e.g.-A evaluation to all combination of A and a, did you write why A is evaluation- pracy to   godzillian A and a ), or even , if you follow same logic, A and not an exotic symbol can be come 0  as well.  which perhaps, you will claim that this is  not your fault BUT you are asking too much from a system which does not even know the language.  I hope you understand, can you tell me in other  way I can resolve this problem?\nUser 1: There are a lot of interesting logic problems. Some of them cannot be solved without allowing the introduction of numbers. \n\nThe problem with the current logical question design, is there is no objective way for you to know the answers are correct. For example, this is a more difficult question. \n\nQ: A's mom & dad each have 5 boys and 4 girls. They have 10 more combined kids than A's direct relatives (\\`  mother and father pairs included \\` ). How many more boys do A's dad and mom have relative to A? Use algebraic expressions with x being the number of boys and y being the number of girls. We want this to be abstract math.\n\nYou can only answer that question if you define the type of math you are using. For some I do know the answer to the question, however, I still cannot answer the question because it is not defined what I am using in the question.\nUser 5: I agree regarding the issue of knowing whether a given logical argument is structurally valid, but what matters is whether the argument makes good sense semantically. If the semantic interpretation makes sense, then the reasoning is valid and the argument is logically valid.\n\nThe best way I can see to resolve this is for people to vote up the arguments they find sensible, so the system can generate synthetic semantic mappings of primitive concepts based on upvoted existing ones. This still requires many inputs, and does not tell us the reason one argument is ranked higher than the other, but at least it gives the system a feedback mechanism.\n\nMore informally, I can notice the top answer for this question, and I learned something here because before, the meaning of \\psi wasn't clear, but now I understand it is used in the analogy approach from logic, but the approach is more intuitive than logical. The next time the system asks me a similar problem, it will be \\ps i for more cleaning up. This seems like a way to capture semantic meaning in the system combined with upvotes on arguments.   \n\n\nI should also link future responses and other posts I make hidden in my comments on other topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n:)\nUser 1: in this example, I would guess what the concept of #Psi and +Psi are\n\nWould it work the same in a written format?\n\nProfessor Van Emelen has a garden where all purple flowers are also edible, and Professor Van Emelen has a new purple flower garden somewhere. Since Professor Van Emelen is a professor, he would never get a purple flower that is not edible, especially if there are hundreds of purple flowers now.\n\nTherefore, the new purple flower garden must be edible.\n\nIn this case, your semantic would be #Psi and +Psi\n\nBut what if the professor is allergic to purple flowers\nUser 5: I think formula (1) and formula (3) would most closely approximate your logic initially, but as you clarified your answer, more familiar terminology came to light. All purple flowers were edible indicates propositionally = {FSP = \\forall v (PFv -> Ev)} in the NLP formalism, where FP=purple flowers, PE=edible flowers. Edible flowers are food, non-food flowers are something different, so we can say \\vee WS = FWv  (A or B \\vee C exists), but"}

Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions. Natural science is like this, and many outstanding social scientists and politicians have also basically created their outstanding achievements from a young age.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]\n\n### Question:\n\"To argue that team cooperation can result in greater achievements, one might examine the performances of various sports teams.
