Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

His whereabouts have been a mystery to this day. Legend has it that Captain Crunch, an old sea dog, was the man to actually find it. In a bottle at the bottom of the mine, the privateer wrote a laconic dispatch:\n\n\"Tis hard to locate tis H-- now as water access is blocked W-- sinkins old leddy [sic] 95 yr over since. The location here in the gap where the Apache run springs which spawn a cove over a great azure spring, are the treasure keys: Over here 2 keepsake mementos are hid! Please visit me again next Sept 22nd!!!\"\n\nLikewise, cryptic tattoos covered Captain Crunch's body. At various points in his life, he apparently summoned one of his crew to cross his arms over a flat surface, drew a large stick figure of himself with a tall, fist shaped nose and a captain's hat on top. Then charred lines indicated its head twinkled in the rain. At various points in his life, he also instructed them to dig three shallow trenches containing iron bars and leave the largest one open. The inscription on these bars? Plenty o' parts, most broken. When his last loan for back paddin' was paid off, Captain Crunch almost yelled, \"I'm just back from the islands! I'm a clew out, but I won't say where 'til there's lots more adventure!\" And he pretty much said \"To hell with it\" and keeled over.\n\nCan you figure out where Captain Crunch hid his treasure chest? Use nothing but the clues Captain Crunch gave you in your attempt.\n\nCapture the videos of various steps clearly, and upload the whole video to your GitHub repo.\n\nSample video: https://twitter.com/MITMoriarty/status/1271995273737638848?s=20\n\nSubmission through Zoom button Below.\n\n### Links:\nhttps://english.kuash.news/news/captain-crunches-treasure-map-4725599\n\n### Prerequisite Information:\nNone\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the challenge description, including the relevant behavior regarding the physical clues one must follow.\n- In the sequence of actions described in the key, isolate the various letters or ciphertexts from the instructions. Use the formula provided below.\n- Place each of the letters using the below mentioned method, and make sure to keep the manuscript places in a convenient format.\n- Collect the letters in each manuscript and figure out the subtle meaning included in the clues with their location, and start with Build A clue to proceed further to Unlock a code!\n\n### Final Solution to Solve:\n\nGiven below is the Strategy to solve:\n\n1. **Transaction Balance:** The Transaction Balance can be calculated by acknowledging three things:\n    \n    - **Current Transaction Balance **: The current transaction balance is specific for each Cryptocurrency and blockchain network. Current wallet and on-chain account balances are included in the official transactions when you are sending cryptocurrency at a given moment.\n    - **Wallet Address Startup Balance:** A default amount is making a unique public address and private key pair for every blockchain wallet when we move from a central bank account to a self-custodial blockchain wallet. We can perceive it from many different perspectives and make a transaction. On a sensible account's balance depends on many different aspects, including the sender of the cryptocurrency, recipients, 0-relationship and the amount of transactions included in the block.\n    - **Transaction 0 fee:** The amount is automatically calculated by the blockchain when any parameters, including the transaction sender, recipients, amount, and confirmation methods, satisfies a transaction's execution rules. It is only required once.\n        - The transaction is charged with a particular fee and only added to the transaction fee if the block is bundled with another transaction fee or rejected from the transaction pool. For example, the way things are, there is no alternate at the moment for us to have a mining fee to improve our available transactions inside blocks. However, the miners, who accumulate a transaction, can take payment fees from the sender.\n    - **Mundane Transaction Fee and Retained Value:** Mundane transaction fees and retained values are the least essential things that need to get paid by the sender of the Transaction Balance transfer ready to keep the process moving. Thusly, the essential thing is that transaction sending address in Ethereum represents a \"blockfile transaction fee,\" which goes either to Ether _Gas price_ or \"blockfile transaction fee,\" An organization that will get the transaction fee by quietly taking care of the whole process of fee-picking and the real-time execution of smart contracts. The blockfile transaction fee also posts the smart contract to the blockchain and will be retained by removing the contract address from the blockfile. This address will no longer be a part of the EthTimer contract each time a new block is appended.\n\n2. Before we continue any further to the next step or mission ensured that the following:\n\n    - **Be sure to get the currency symbol, in which they require.**\n    - **Access the below mentioned link to get the denominations: https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/list-of-10-largest-metal-mining-plants-in-the-world.html**\n    - **If the currency amount is higher than 1, enter the currency amount as, for instance, 1=1,000.**\n- To get the transaction balance for the below-mentioned currencies, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n    - **First of all, the user is required to enter the required currency name.**\n    - **Then add the respective currencyid = symbol**\n\n    For eg. Cryptocurrency_RESULTS.csv = Poker Reserves  (PR).\n    Poker Reserves (PR) has **2.134e1015**\n\n3. Added the value of the blockchain, amount in the currency type and the equation.\n\n    Blockchain = Number of Blockchain Accounts * Denomination + Number of Blockchain Accounts * - Denomination\n\n    Amount = 100 - Max transaction amount\n\n    Each step's details can easily get from the below link. The details and video tutorial will help you understand more*.\n\n4. **Part 3:**\n\n-  The solution automatically generates the results based on the values passed in step - 2.\n-  **However, there is no direct way to figure out currency's transaction balance cursively.**\n-  Hence, the user is required to figure out the results displayed in crypto_results. The results are 10-digit long entries with two digits as 15.\n    \n5. Let's disable the false coins from the table that requires calculation.\n\n6. **More Details:**\n\n- Bitcoin = 1.75 billion\n- Bitcoin Cash = 253.84 million\n- Bitcoin Diamond = 501.26 million\n-"}

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

It is well known that folding a paper twice will produce another cut side of the paper. It is not hard to see that folding will change the vector parallel to the paper side and make it appear another cut side of the paper. The determined process of folding is randomly shuffled from time to time. Specifically, we use **fold's index as period** to establish the parameter that numPeriod is folded.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. Input:\n    - format: Fold indicator.\n    - index: Fold indicator's index.\n- Return:\n    - folded_index: Returns folded index.  \n\n- Jan11.md couple of 00000001 digits with each digit weighted uniformly in the range of 0 to 15 and append a leading zero 00 before the generated 1-digit number.  \n`Example Input`:\n\n00\n\n`Example Output`:\n\n0000000  \n\n> Mentored by @cutyxu2019\n\n<hr/>\n\n---\n\n### Class 3\n\n#### Rd3_L4_Rapid 3.

A prime sieve is a process that uses a sequence of numbers as a filter to generate the next sequence of prime numbers. The next sequence starts from the square of the previous sequence endpoints, such as 2, 9 is a prime sieve. Prime sieve uses a sieve to make numbers equally divided into two parts: a whole number and a residue. Primes that cannot be divided by a prime sieve are called BFS and other prime numbers are called news, here four-bit sieve is used. First, the four numbers 1 through 4 are arranged on an horizontal line, and then sets a variable L to bars of length 4, and the smallest prime number in this variable is present in the entire sequence. For example, the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Take them to the first half, get a pair \"1, 2\", \"3 4\". The following diagram will make it clearer.2 1 2 3 4 L 19355743220896780129 4235936460301365123561 3278963671623130012723 513 01 2 0 1 2 0 3 1 Q3 0\n\n### Input Format:\nTwo levels of input. The first line contains a positive integer n (the radius of the square of the square). Second line input n space-separated integers. The second line also enters n space separated integers x 1 . .. . x n (The number of prime residual limits cannot exceed 20,000).\n\n### Output Format:\nOutput the square array A.We note that there are smaller prime divisors than 2, 3 and 5. A[i][j] = 1 means that you have to move to the fourth number. A[i][j] = 0 does not have to move on the number of four. We also note that: there may be no dv+1 or empty sequence.\n\n##8367\n(D"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
