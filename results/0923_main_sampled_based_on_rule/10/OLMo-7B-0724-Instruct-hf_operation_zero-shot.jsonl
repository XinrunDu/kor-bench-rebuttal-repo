Hence, the value of A + B is:\r\nA + B = 23 + 7+B = 30+B\r\n\r\nTherefore, the possible value of X, considering the result for A = 8:\r\nX = A○B = 8○(30+B) = 240 + 8B\r\n\r\nSince we are looking for an integer value, we can substitute for values of B that make X an integer:\r\nWhen B = 7, X = (240 + 8 × 7) = [(40+56) + 42] = [(252) + 42] = 294\r\nThe decimal approximation of 294 rounds to the value of 288, so keeping it as 8/6 (which is actually 153/6 = 29.5).\r\n\r\nWhen B = 6, X = (240 + 8 × 6) = 0+72 = 72.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we double-check the result, we find that 72 is not a perfect square (this operation is based on squares) and fails to validate the \"-or\" condition, so let's proceed with the next possibility.\r\n\r\nWhen B = 5, X = (240 + 8 × 5) = 0+40 = 40.\r\n\r\nBut 40 is also not a perfect square, so we should consider the third possibility:\r\n\r\nWhen B = 4, X = (240 + 8 × 4) = 360 ÷ (8 + 3⋅8) = 360 ÷ 35 = 10.\r\n\r\nSo, 10 doesn't work out well either, and we are left with:\r\n\r\nWhen B = 3, X = (240 + 8 × 3) = 240 + 24 = 164.\r\n\r\nNow, we check 164 squares:\r\nIt's a perfect square, and that yields 2 rows of rows of squares:\r\n164² = 26,406, ×(164+26,406) ≈ 26,406+26,406⋅164 = 5125,511\r\nBoth of these values are too high to match 187. This is not a solvable situation using this process. If we assumed the question, stating \"an integer\", meant a perfect square (W.T.F.), suppose B = 2.\r\n\r\nWhen B = 2, X = (240 + 8 × 2) = 240 + 8 × 2 = 259.\r\n 259 is a perfect square: 259² = (29,Research) × (29 + 2596) = 1,301, 596\r\nBoth of these values are too high, and we consider the next possibility:\r\n\r\nWhen B = 1, X = 240 + 8 × 1 = 248.\r\n\r\nThis time, the calculations lead to:\r\n248² = (24,8) × (24,8 + 2444) ≈ 24,8 + 2444⋅24,8 = 56,384\r\nAnd these values are also too high, so we conclude that:\r\n\r\n[[23or1]]."}

Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given rule for the operation a★b represents the area under the curve of 2x from a to b, which is then integrated from 0 to b. Since the question asks to find the value of b if 0★b = b, we know that the integral of 2x from 0 to b is equal to b itself:\n\n∫0b 2x dx = b\n\nSolving for b:\n\n2b = b\n\nb = 1\n\nHowever, if there is more than one answer, we can write it as [1]. Therefore, the answer is [[1]]."}
