We have 4 choices for each letter, so the total number of possible words is 4^4 = 256.\n\nHowever, we need to follow the rule that each letter can be used at most once in a word. To find all the possible words which can be constructed from the given set of letters, let's consider each possible combination of letters for each word separately.\n\nFor the first word, let's consider the four possible combinations of letters.

So only 'BEA', 'BTAE', 'ETA' can be used for the first word.\n\nFor the second word, the possible combinations are 'AEB', 'BTE', 'TBE', 'ETAB', 'ETA'\n\nOut of the six combinations, 'BTE', 'ETAB', 'ETA' are already taken. Therefore, we can only use 'AEB', 'TBE', 'BEA' for the second word.\n \nSimilarly, for the third and fourth words, the remaining combinations not already taken are, 'AEB', 'TBE', 'ETA', 'BEA'\n\nSo the output for the given puzzle is: [[BEA], [BTAE], [TBEA], [ETBA], [ TBEA], [ ETBA], [AEB], [ TBE], [BEA], [ETA]]\n\nHowever, the output for the question provided needs to be given in order, so we can arrange the words in the order, 'BEA', 'TBEA', 'ETBA', 'BTAE', in each answer. \n\n[[BEA], [TBEA], [ETBA], [BTAE]]"}

In both cases, we have a remaining value of 'b', i.e.,\n\n(a/b) + a*b + ? + ? = 14\n\nFor both cases (a/b = 4/b = 4), the remaining value is b = 6 (as we remain with 6/1 when we divide 6 by 1, as multiplication and division are opposite operations). Now, let's put the numbers to work:\n\n(4/6) + 4*6 + ? + ? = 14\n16/6 + 4*6 + ? + ? = 14\n\nWhatever numbers we choose for the ?, would have to be such that the above equations are numerically equal. Let's try some numbers:\n\n(4/6) + (6) + 6 + 2 = 14\n16/6 + 4 * 6 + 6 + 2 = 14\n\n16 + 42 + 6 + 2 = 14\n16 + 42 + 12 + 2 = 14\n16 + 56 + 2 = 14\n60 + 2 = 14\n62 = 14 (NO SOLUTION)\n\nUnluckily, there's no integer solution for this step (with unchanged b), so we need to check a different way:\n\n3. As there seems no way to make the equation work with unchanged b, let's see what happens when we remove one of the 'b's between plus signs:\n\n(a/b) + a*b + ?*b + ? = 14  (for now, 'b' remains)\n\n(4/b) + 4 * b + ? * b + ? = 14\n\nNow, taking back to the 'non-changed' b equation (step 2), we already knew that b = 6, so comparing both expressions, we can figure out that 14 = 4 * 6 + ? * 6 + ? + ? (all ?=2). If our ?=2, we still have a second operation symbol with 'b'. In that sense, it's similar to step 3. However, having two 'b' operations in a row is possible, though it needs to be handled in another way:\n\n[4/b+4*b+2*b+2=14]\n\nOur aim is to convert the second and fourth 'b's into constants. For this, 'b' shall be recently involved in a division operation. Now, let's put 8 back into the equation:\n\n[4/8+8*b+2*b+2=14]\n\nThis is now possible, so let's proceed:\n\n[2+8*b+2*b+2=14]\n\nNow, let's subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n[2+8*b+2*b = 12]\n\nSince we're looking for integer solutions, we now try a quick method:\n\n[16+8*b = 20]\n\n6*b can't divide 20, hence let's consider (16+8)*b = 20: \n\n24 * b = 20\nb = 1\n\nNow, let's put this final 'b' value back to the overall equation:\n\n[2 + 8*1 + 2*1 + 2 = 14]\n\n[10 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 14]\n\n[14 = 14]\n\nThe solution for these equations is:\n\na = 4, b = 1, c = 4, and d = 2. The resulting equation is [[4/1+4*1+4*2+2=14]].\n\nAlternatively, you could distinguish whether any result other than 1 for b would lead to an integer solution, but it appears there are not many possibilities, and, as a result, that the answer shall be a combination of 1 and another eternally non-integer 'b', like 4/b."}

The given rectangular grid has pre-filled numbers in each row and column.\n   - In this puzzle, the given numbers are 26, 33, 19, and 31, 7, 25, 15.\n\n2.

Ensure the original row and column sum is the sum of the filled numbers in each row and column.\n\nNow, let's solve the given puzzle step by step:\n\n1. Let's consider the first row (from left to right) in the given grid. Each space in this row has an X arranged in a row. Replace each X with a possible number that would make the row's sum equal to 26.\n   - After trying all the numbers from 1 to 26, we can find that this row can be filled with numbers 2, 6, 9, and 25.\n\n2.

Replace each X with a possible number that would make the column's sum equal to 26.\n   - After trying all the numbers from 1 to 26, we can find that this column can be filled with numbers 25, 15, 7, and 31.\n\n3. Now, let's do the same for the second row. Again, fill the spaces in this row with possible numbers such that the row's sum is equal to 33.\n   - After trying all the numbers from 1 to 33, we can find that the second row can be filled with numbers 1, 7, 16, and 33.\n\n4. Do the same process for the remaining rows and columns.\n\nAfter solving all the rows and columns, we get the fills for our puzzle.\n\nAnswer: [[2, 6, 9, 25], [1, 7, 16, 33], [4, 10, 11, 19], [31, 12, 14, 8]]\n\nRemember, double square brackets surround the final answer, like this: [[your answer]]."}

(1,1)(2,1):2÷: We need to find two numbers (say x and y) in the first row that can be divided by 2 and have their sum equal to 2. The only possible solutions for N=4 are (x=2, y=1).\n2. (3,3)(3,4):2÷: At the top right corner, find two numbers (say x and y) such that their sum is divisible by 2 and is equal to 6. The only solution is (x=4, y=2). Note that there is no other solution for N=4.\n3. (1,2)(1,3):1-: In the first row, find the first two elements such that their sum (x + y) is not divisible by 2. Here, it is x=1 and y=3.\n4. (1,4)(2,4):8* : In the last two cells at the fourth row, observe that their product should be 8. The only options are (x=4, y=0) and (x=0, y=8). Both of these do not satisfy the unique solution needed for the given constraints, hence there is no solution for this region.\n5. (2,2)(2,3):3* : In the second and third columns of the second row, find two numbers (x and y) whose product is 3. The only two such numbers for N=4 are x=2 and y=1.\n6. (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ : In the third and fourth rows, as well as the first and second columns, find a way to place distinct numbers from 1 to 4 such that their sum in each 2 x 2 sub-region is equal to 13. This can be done by placing the numbers in the order: (3,1)(3,2) = 13-5-3 = (1,1)(1,2) = 13-8-5 = (4,1)(4,2) = 13-3-10 = 2\n\nNow, apply the numbers to the grid:\n\n1 2\n3 1\n4 0\n0 7\n5 6\n0 1\n7 8\n8 0\n\nFinally, stack the rows horizontally (separated by commas):\n\n[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]\n\nConcatenate the two rows vertically (separated by square brackets): \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]\n\nThus, the final output for the given puzzle problem rules is: \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]"}

We choose (2, X, X, X) as it adheres to the constraint (2,3) < (2,4).\n- Row 3 must have a 1 in the upper-left corner, as (3,1) > (3,2).

And the cells surrounding them cannot be mines, and hence we replace the \"X\" in those cells with \"A.\"\n\n* Cluster (2,4) consisting of $(2,3)$ and $(3,3)$: There is only one mine on this cluster at $(2,3),$ so we replace the \"X\" in $(3,3)$ with \"A.\"\n\n* Cluster (3,4) consisting of $(3,3)$: There isn't any mine on this cluster because there is just one cell, $(3,3).$\n\nNow, based on these observations, we can build the resulting puzzle with \"A\"s where mines are located:\n```\nX A A   A   A\nA   A   A   A   A\nA   A   A   A   A\nA A A A   A\nA   A A   A   A\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\n[[X A A, A 2 2, 2 3 A], \n A   A   A,   A   A, \n A   A   A,   A   A, \n A A A A, A   A   A]]\n```"}

First, the player starts at the top-left cell and moves right due to the arrow. In the second row, the player moves down due to the arrow, and in the third row, the player moves left, then up in the fourth row. In the fifth row, the player continues moving up, and finally, in the sixth row, the player moves right and then upwards. This results in an infinite loop of cells starting from the top row and going down and right, which leads to the end.\n\nTo extract the positions of the inflection points in order, the path is processed row by row and column by column. For each column, the player's position is recorded in the row beneath it, based on the relations between the arrows. This shows the path in a summarized format, with 1 meaning the player was in that position, and 0 meaning they were not. Finally, each row is separated with a comma, and the entire path is separated with a space, resulting in the given answer:\n\n[[1 0 2 3 0 4,5 0 6]]"}
