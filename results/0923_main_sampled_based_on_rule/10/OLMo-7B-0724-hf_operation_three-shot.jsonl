Given that: 10 ※ 2 = 9. Find C.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[4]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 4※7.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[5::10]]\nYour approach is perfect, but inside function Compute※, your final answer did not pass the muster.\nTry editting it again.\n\n\nA: \nI realize the answer is just not \"something + 3\", but I don't understand why.\n\nThe function is a multiple of the second argument (b) if it's some amount of time the second argument, or vice versa. The operation returns 2 if they happen to be the same, and 24 if they're not. You'll note that you have a check for when the second argument is a multiple of the first, and you have a check for when the first argument is a multiple of the second. What you don't have is checking for when neither are. Here's a vice versa case:\nlet a = 7;\nlet b = 10;\n\na.times≤b returns 5 because the first argument must be a multiple of the second. \na≤b.times returns 2 because the second argument must be a multiple of the first. \na.times:b returns 24 because a and b must NOT be multiples... at least one of them must be, but the other is a non-multiple.\n\nThese also follow the rule that when a is a multiple of b, a.times≤b should be a.times(b+3) because when a is a multiple of b, a is a.times(x) where x is (b+3/a.) When b is a multiple of a you have a.times:b = a/b + 2 which returns 0, so a.times:b = a.times(b+2)+2. Lastly, a/b+2 should equal b/a+2 and also return 0 through equality.\n\nSo far, so good but now, going back to the actual rule for the operation: when a is (b+3/a) then you must subtract 3 from b times a. For example:\nlet a = 4;\nlet b = 10;\n\nfirstFunction(a, b) returns 8.\nsecondFunction(b, a) returns 3, which you might violate when you change 10to 11.\nfirstFunction(4, 11) returns 5, and secondFunction(11, 4) returns 33.\nEither way, checks should return false, an invalid character. These steps are done at the bottom of each function in return operations so that they validate if the proper conditions were met for the operation to be valid. See function FirstFunctionArray(Num a, Num b) at arity: (2). Here's a simple one:\n\nIn regular languages, || means or, and & means and. So if this were a regular language, then \"not\" would mean \"or,\" but it doesn't because it is instead the existence operator. If the condition is not true, then it evaluates to a falsy value \"-\" which evaluates to \"false\"!). So this checks that a is not b, which means if it is, it must not be. It then multiplies a and b together to return their product (times) and calls it \"calc.\" It then checks that it is equal to a divided by b, which will return false if it is the wrong number. It negates the result with !, because !;\"calc\" will evaluate to false. We negate that because we mean to represent the negation of this result back as our result we currently use. It satisfies all conditions, so equals should call return.\n\nreturn calc == \"a\" / \"b\" \n\nThis bit means that \"calc\" should equal \"a\" over \"b\" which equals \"a\" over \"b\" multiplied by 2 floating-point times plus 1, returning \"a\" over \"b\" swapped to an interchangeable amount of wrong computation depending on whether it was calculated using calculator b and input a, or input b and calculate a."}

ISO says\n\n1.6.7 Custom Operations\n\nA custom operation is defined in [the numeric-Rational/custom-op/CFIs\nsection](https://mathml3.pdf) [Steve][PDF].\n\n\nWhile ISO 1000 is broken by not providing an entry to indicate where the custom operation is located in any iteration of the MathML family, this really appears to be a technical flaw in these groups' development practices.  I sincerely regret that I need to be the one to \"point it out,\" as at the time this work was still undertaken, I was not aware that I had been awarded the right to do so.\n\n\n*Nonetheless, except for the grandfathered MML_Role attrib and associated functions, the normalized form of any valid SAS-CAE/EDIRM attribute appears to be allowed to be used at will for assigning new operation names.  That said, the\n\n*Your proposed usage seems identical to the published version of -1 in `number.box`.  There is an accompanying com and type given as a defined float.  The current version of this type specifically lists Angle° as being outside of that context framework, and no others seem to have a context defined.  In this instance, -1 is explicitly NOT GENERALIZED in search of its context.  It is indeed always directly connected to Angle°.\n\n\nI personally like the idea of allowing an operation's context to be freely assignable, but there are also a number of existing operations which don't have a clear hierarchy.  I will therefore look into resolving this issue soon.  In the meanwhile, I am unable to specifically authorize this usage, and requesting clarification on the announced plan would be the course I would advocate for planning future work.\n\n\n*Unfortunately, I often don't get a chance to personally write the documentation for a subject until some time after it's been assigned.  However, the documentation that gets posted without that little watermark is that which the editors approved and which finally went to the verifier for final review, so I'm not going to attribute it to myself without a credibility check.  In the meantime, the content I have published in relation to this issue should NOT be assumed to be correct, anywhere on the web.\n\nMy overall impression is that **I have already set out a process for dealing with special characters** inside ordered lists, so I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this purpose to \"determine how the software is going to accommodate Unicode and concurring special characters.\"  The table cell example appears to come around from the left-hand side of that custom operation diagram spelled out at the bottom of that page, with side notation having tightened up the common sense of \"AT ANY TIME\" by rendering the alternative or placement in question serially and sequentially.\n\nIndeed, the issue suggested here seems specifically to cover the issue of how text is processed (and how a borrowed symbol is applied), and it seems to directly involve the mathmlNextName (specifically: mathmlNextNameL1) which is identified as being used as an identifier in the space of renaming mathematical expressions and documents.  This issue therefore somewhat directly involves the way that these materials will be processed and handled for rendering purposes.  Consider the issue of the mathematical operation in words that could have a modular structure to it, while other words which would instead be right next to have a chance to specify their own conversation with a circle la, lil, or nil.\n\nOf course, it's okay to use square brackets for that (if you're good with [,it]ct).\n\nbestmats said:\n\n\nwhat would it mean and how should it be expressed if [this] and were 1st and 2nd respectively?\n\n\nThere was an argument from MathML 3 against us making a list jump while having a list already in progress, with the argument that individual words in an academic sentence aren't necessarily seen as individual words, and not as valid topics for explicit ordering.\n\nBest Practice\nWe would probably need a blanket replacement for different types of diacryptic and/or special-character combinations that may be desired in expressions.\n\nBest Practice\nWe're just going to need to figure out a way to interface with alphabetized lists of words at some point in time, so we may as well just get to the left-hand side of this as quickly as possible so as to avoid any potential squabbles.\n\nAfter collecting all of that together, the answer to this question appears to be something like \"we can't currently let you pluralize right now, because we just don't have what it takes to do that yet.\"\n\nbestmats said:\n\n\nI'm curious what would lead Satan to have the name Satan, yet be God to the future?\n\n\nAt one, the level of the context you're trying to create is just quite higher than is apparent at the moment.  You are being requested to adopt a level where a discussion about the level of context that you're seeking to create is possible and feasible"}
