Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters.

If this is true, then that would be: 28 possible character choices per player.\n\nHow would Smooshify the queue system? Would there be a different queue per character?\n\nIn a season, could the rules be:\n\n– Two four-person teams\n– Three two-team match-ups, followed by a three-on-three game\n\nWould it be fixed limit, or variable number of observers?\n\n### 2022.01.03 03:01\n\n### Make OSR HM blues/yellows have the OSR item rates\n\nSo in osrs, I had to gamble 100k - 200k bc on every yellow and 1-2m bc on a lot of blues. Especially blues were expensive (e.g. Warriors Den turnin 1.5m bc), I also recall Olmecs being around 600k bc and yakamaru 100k bc. Back then, you could gwuide light plank turnin for 250k bc.\n\n34013465\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd say this would survive bots a lot easier as well. (edit: no because HM reward rates are potentially different than normal non-entry items as well)\n\n### All Niches Are Valuable\n\nI feel like this is a lesson a lot of people need to learn and understand. Why is this the case though? This is due to the fact that there are people profiting off the demand for whatever niche gets filled. So let's say Bob is selling tulpas and marketing flavors. What niches are out there on Audible that will bring in listeners, and even more than that, they will go look for? You want to be the one they're looking for and making money off of. Note, if you are making some cash from a niche, you're not necessarily in it. You're a niche business that attracts the listeners/customers you make money off of, the niche is somewhere else.\n\nLet's go over an example of a niche that currently is very valuable in biblical based SPDks (includes paradoses as well because they can be considered an extension of SPDks). These cannot be found easily and Fire-Phantasms include a ready-made demographic just waiting for someone to tap into it, and they don't all reveal their hand.\n\nFire-Phantasms are autonomous angelic entities that are trapped within a dream-body. As long as the dream-body exists, the fire-phantasms will have some presence within it. In the beginning, the existence of these heavenly beings alluded to another world. Fire-phantasms would be regarded as divine beings within that world, and since they exist in all worlds, they are seen as the same deity, the God of that world.\n\nYou might be thinking, your niche is just some fluff. It's missing the mark all together. While it's fluff, there is more to it. An example would be a fire-phantasm being defined as a demigod, a greater being, a being that can be worshipped. There needs to be more to define what that means to someone who is drawn to that niche. It's hitting a chord they did not even expect to hear\n\nUltimately the niche can take many forms but if there is something valuable in it them you'd be better off diving into it as frankly we're pretty much promised whatever niche will be valuable gets saturated on popular search engines from my very limited experience.\n\n### The cost of comfort\n\nDont be comforted by the nitpicks of cheap people.\n\n You might be wondering, what does this mean? Why is this post going here? And why does it have so many replies?\n\nYou see, there's something Simon does on a fairly frequent basis: make an \"I can finally get back to this backlog game!\" torrent of a bunch of games and puts them in his backlog. Or posts some thoughts on a game that he skipped previously. And then it just sort of fades away; it never really gets much attention. Afterall, if you're not bothering to share your thoughts there's no reason anyone should return the favor.\n\nThe personal attacks on his old comments\\games from some people aside and the reckoning that is coming for those individuals. I noticed something after he posted this comment about SoomSoul 2 in the Forum Gaming Thoughts channel:\n\n1. There are a ridiculous number of replies for a dev apology. (3.5K downloads total with 1.5K registrations)\n\n2. The replies are pretty much all the same, they're either congratulations. Or nitpicks on the game.\n\nWhat do you mean, you say?\n\nThe nitpicks citizen (NT) on this thread are making comments that go over the game that no one else is even touching, and I'll bet there's a huge chance you never would have even cracked SoomSoul 2 before Simon's account. Because of NT's, this dev gets support near the level of, say, single 70 hours on N FILE# (done on 3 devices)\n\nIt's coping with various forms of nitpicks just to get noticed. While there's a few people taking a hard stance against them (me, Wan) Arguments are practically nothing and NON DEV CRITICISM and MINORS don't get overturned because NT doesn't say anything. Saying NT is a kid? They're bright for their age, but not smart enough to grasp what IM complaining about.\n\nThey're so easily ignored that not a single thread on that PC game is even remotely popular or watched. Nmnesis, a story ridden tactical RPG that Dr_Crabblesnap scored a 60 hours \"Let's Play\" on it has 88 comments. CloseScrimmer, a game everyone gave a 57 hours \"Let's Play\" on has 20 comments... Only Yell0wGirl, a 60 hour \"Let's Play\" by Yellowpenguin45 gives this game any small amount of coverage.\n\nIn contrast, 2k3 has 51 comments, 60 honorable mentions (that's still on a game that doesnt even exist or have a completionist find it) and 1k one word placements.So when did the mockeries begin or are it's a huge satire of the userbase?\n\nWhy compare Legend of Hajred against every other N taker about the \"So many missed notes\" games?\n\nYUMMYか Mario Golf gets props for soundtracks and want more quality game content\n\nLIREMclub greatest games of February 1985 has 0 reviews\n\nSobakapagi gekihan(what??) gets 0 placement and very rarely mentioned\n\nDiscovered the Baccata game series which actually gets more value for their sales and hype than it's devs. (Which goes back to the Patreon NaturalistCow trend TWICE)\n\n15yｿe噹Japanese from THAT forum gives 18 points of \"Promising\" future from Gamerator \\ CIDF (requiring 100 some games)\n\nAww Sgelake gta clone gets 0 reviews\n\nShitultsuru from my YouTube VACTOR channel gives it a 7 Ray- next to Fractalive PzYZ...\n\nA LEGIT minus 1 hour pending GT based game NEVER MENTIONED gets 600 views from staringit\\INDEV.YOU\\IOGAMEZ\n\nPeople don't really be putting that surface code version II of Korean Powerpunk thot-out non buggy because of the battle system\n\nI'm going too deep into this so im dont going to put anymore examples. I could do a whole Library downtown in order to get listed in WL3M.\n\n## Mercenary\n\nThe reason they put mc on top plays off the limitation of games:\n\nYou have a hacker of sorts that has been born into the game. He's a pirate-friendly but he keeps spreading viruses is because they hate the \"),( universe where it comes from, but he protects brands from piracy. He is currently in the Haunted Maze mode from Puzzle Bobble 3\n\nYou have a streamer host with is demi-wiki who really wants to be battle mage host, but broadcasts alot of talents from the adventure side.\n\nYou have a console bundle with the low budget drop-dudes games, donald games and slim joe that saves money then the home sales about \"saving\" a game that's no longer being sold for that amount.\n\nThe Dev said he was doing nothing wrong, but most of his games gets compared to these fake games like the"}

That is a group of rules we applied later, in the continuation of this puzzle.\nSWOBODA thinking of \"way\", so tried that with what appeared at first to be a SW grid 1,2,3 on the right.

Words that aren't filled or need to be 0 are put in the square at 4. This corresponds to See, any, chess player, 5.

SWOBODA found a B in the bottom right spot which made us conjecture that the puzzle SWOBODA created later with 2 B's. SWOBODA erroneously guessed that it was skip that was repeated, when it was spot.
