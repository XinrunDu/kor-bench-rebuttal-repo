The view of the numbers is that they would make the grid, and every number in the grid has been filled with a unique integer from 1 to 81 in ascending order consecutively. The question you will solve is a combinatorial puzzle in the sense given above. The exact format will depend on the question when you click the button, but for this question you can assume that the order of the numbers appears in what format you indicate by stating it in the following format.\n\nConsider 9 numbers in the grid which appear consecutively and each number appears once. Can you find the first # without changing the order in which they appear in the grid? So for example consider the initial grid:\n\n01 25 16 95 11 03 16 71 15\n14 23 15 96 23 46 18 83 35\n41 19 50 28 19 05 47 94 38\n6 17 31 16 76 41 94 22 10\n13 06 87 17 00 26 00 30 21\n18 59 96 29 58 84 03 41 14\n02 66 00 10 22 17 54 49 67\n39 75 32 57 79 37 47 34 40\n29 23 88 10 27 70 16 78 25\n\nThe problem involves finding the first integer that is missing in the grid. The final solution has to return a list that contains the first number not missing in the grid such that it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- 9 or 0 numbers are missing in the grid but values can be the same\n- \nThe first two missing numbers (0 and 9) should have the same value\nThe order of the numbers in the grid is also important but it was ignored by the question.\nThe initial problem's formula has the numbers in the grid arranged horizontally, with each row containing numbers from the first row to the same row minus one number of the similar row. After the calculation, it maps the numbers in the grid to the ranges [1..9][1..9][1..9][1..n]\n- 81 numbers are present in the grid\n- The difference between the sum of the sums and the sum of the sums2 is calculated on [1..2][1..2] (Math.sqrt(15)+1)\n- If there was a 9, then there must have been a mistake in the translation of the numbers into grids. I also used [1..2][1..2] as a part of the grid setup because in the problem set the translator used the values of the numbers as integers. The previous blank grids mentioned in the problem statement are used in the second grid.\nCan you figure out a way to play 'Drag this grid to make the first number with the missing number in the grid appear in the same location as the grid grid? Please confirm you understand the question by providing the answer key and provide a smaller version of the the grid.\nIf there are no missing numbers, 9 numbers are missing and the answer will be completely the same as total number of numbers.\nIf no information about the number of numbers missing is provided, 0 numbers are missing in the grid. Their order should not be changed and initial numbers can have a value of 9 or 0.\nIf the answer key given below does not answer this question, please provide us with the answer key you provide for the test or the final answer that was not answer the question you provided the users with.\nIf there are 0 numbers missing in the original grid then answers will be:\nTotal Numbers in the Grid : 80\nNumbers to Missing grid Position : (0, 4) and (N+2, N+2)\nNumbers of X's : (0, 1, 5, 00, 02, 5, 1, 6, 5, 01)\nNumber to be written in the grid plate: (1, 1)\nLoupES Adrien requests to drop question Mongo by Admin"}

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzles are played on an n*n grid, with some grids containing hint numbers and the rest being blank grids.\n2.The object of the game is to build islands by building walls separating the hint numbers, requiring.\n3.Each island contains only one hint number.\n4.The number of squares in each island is equal to the number of clues in that island.\n5.Islands are separated from each other vertically or horizontally.\n6.There are no 2x2 or larger rectangles in the area formed by the wall.\n7.Walls can form a continuous path.\n8.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank square filled with X.The player should replace the grid on which the wall is built with A and output the drawn matrix, which contains X (the blank island), A (the wall) and the numbers.\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X 2 X\nX 4 X X X\n1 X X X 1\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.
