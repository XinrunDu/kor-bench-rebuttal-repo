The stars need to be spread out such that each row, column, and partition has no more than n stars placed in it.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the different regions in the grid. In this example, the regions are:\n   - A: square A to square B\n   - B: square C to square F\n   - C: square C to square F, including its diagonals\n   - D: square D to square B\n   - F: all squares F to square B, including its diagonals\n   - H: all squares H to square B, including its diagonals\n   - I: all squares I to square B, including its diagonals\n\n2. Calculate the number of stars that should be placed in each region using the formula:\n   - n for rows * (columns) + n * (rows) + rooms * (columns)\n\n3. Divide the grid diagonally into rows and columns based on the number of stars required in each region. In the example, we divide the grid into:\n   - Row 1: square C to square F, including its diagonals. The number of stars is 4.\n   - Row 2-Row 5: squares A to I. The number of stars is 5.\n   - Row 6: squares B, D to square B. The number of stars is 4.\n   - Row 7: squares H to square B, including its diagonals. The number of stars is 5.\n   - Row 8: squares I to square B, including its diagonals. The number of stars is 4.\n\n4. Fill the first row to ensure that the space is filled with stars. We use this row to fill the remaining rows and columns, following the formula above for each region.\n\n5. To fill the region, we use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm starts from the first region and explores available positions while preventing stars from overlapping. Each step, we select the next available position, then check if it's valid and place a star, ensuring stars are not placed in adjacent squares (including diagonally).\n\n6. We continue this process until we fill all the regions.\n\n7. Since we have defined a custom puzzle format with a specific grid, there is no need to use a classic algorithm such as a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Greedy approach as those do not apply to our puzzle format.\n\n8. Verify the solution by manually counting the number of stars placed in each region and ensuring every column, row, and partition has no more than n stars.\n\n9. Formatting the answer in alphabetical order with separate entries for regions and separating columns with a line breaker.\n\n### Answer:\n[[[]]]"}
