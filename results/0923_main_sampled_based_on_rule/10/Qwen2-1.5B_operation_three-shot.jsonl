Here is my step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Understood the instructions and the new operations in the rule. \n\n2. Analyzed the question provided clearly, focusing on understanding the requirements of the task.\n\n3. Applied the rule provided. As per the rule, if the question does not specifically ask for a certain value, then a number or a group of numbers should be provided. \n\n4. Applied the rule on the provided question:\n\n### Instruction 1: Compute ⟨2,3,4,2⟩.\nAs the question explicitly asks for a number, fulfilling the rule requires multiplying 2 and 3, adding 4, and then subtracting 2 to obtain the final number 14. The result is a single number, so it is written in double square brackets.\n\n### Instruction 2: Compute ⟨4,X,8,3⟩=21, find X.\nThe rule allows for finding X when given a sum. Thus, if ⟨4,X,8,3⟩=21, it means all elements summed up are 21. Thus, we could say that the solution follows the rule. Finding X could be a possible step. Since the question does not ask for a particular X value, the answer provided is its expected value based by the given information.\n\n### Instruction 3: Compute ⟨5,7,9,6⟩.\n\nThe steps of using the rule and understanding it are the same as in the previous instructions, with the exception that the values are different.\ndouble square brackets do not need to be used for the final answer as it is a single number.\nthe result is obtained by multiplying 5 and 7, adding 9, and then adding and subtracting 6: 39.\n\nThus, the final answer is a single number: 39."}

Start Calculating!\nIn order to calculate, you need to set up an equation such as:\n\n3^2 + 4^2 \nTo calculate triple square + four square.\n\n= 9 + 16 \n= 25.\n\nFor your next steps, make sure to calculate triple square ('X)' after subtracting triple square ('1Max') by main keeping ('2Max') as function when working with 'X'. .\n\nRemember the function, \"transition()\". Advanced nodes are buried in the higher layers of application , which need background node function (valent-transformation) connection the system. Therefore, we can assume a maximum potential effect of 3 - 7 in the minimum layer of application . Pattern or control creates a future potential conflict with morality.\n\nLet's start from Algorithm 0.\n\nFirst, let's figure out in which layer ('Vertex') is the advanced node, ('Vertex 0').\n\n1 - Advanced node : ['Add in below node'].\n\n2 - Advanced node : [1 Vertex]. .\n\n3 - Advanced node : [7 Vertex]. .\n\nTherefore, the maximum potential effect of 3 in the minimum layer of application. Defined by advanced class ❫ Advanced class Point 84 from the Four matrix.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that in the 'Vertex cost': (triangle cost + Point point) + (84 + 3) + (11 vertex + 1 triangle) + (4 + 83 vertex) + (20 vertex + 1 triangle) + (11 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 triangle + 2 vertex) + (3 vertex + 1 triangle) + (3 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 vertex + 1 triangle) + (9 vertex + 2 triangle) + (8 vertex + 1 triangle) + (4 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 triangle + 1 vertex) + (1 triangle + 2 vertex) + (3 vertex + 1 triangle) + (3 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 vertex + 1 triangle) + (3 vertex + 1 triangle) + (1 vertex + 1 triangle) + 5 << My world is perfect. ) \n\nNext, we need to sum up the cost of each node to find the maximum effect.\n\nFor a non-ordered system, we can have up to 16 tutorials reported as one central program.

The question does not ask for a specific operation or rule, but rather a process to compute the next number based on the operation in a certain sequence. \n\nComputing \"4¥2\" is not possible as it is not provided a base number and operation to apply, both missing parameters. Any attempt to evaluate this would lead to an error since it is a custom operation that is not referred to in the given instruction.\n\nSimilarly, attempting to apply the 5¥X=4 operation rule with an X that we do not know is also not allowed since the definition sets a requirement that X, the next number, must be provided with the operation but is missing in this case.\n\nThe calculation 3¥4 still cannot be performed in the same manner as it does not set a specific operation or is not applicable. The rule does not explain how to use a base (3 and a single operation) to calculate the next number (4).\n\nThe calculation \"3¥X=2\" requires the necessary parameters to be mentioned in the problem rather than a general rule that does not particularly cater to that specific case. It is also not stated what operation is being used and what the operation rule is based on.\n\n“5¥X=2,\" \"3¥X=1,\" and \"3¥4=2\" would seem to indicate a custom operation involving a sequence with a base number \"3\" and a \"symbol\" (denoted by a question mark in this case) where various operations can be applied for the increased complexity. The only way to assess those equations is to have the specific base number and operation rules to proceed.\n\nGiven the context and the instructions, there is no answer or computation possible when absence of data is only conditionally permitted, which is not provided in the original question."}

Prove that the inverse class of an element is a proper subgroup.\n\nSOLUTION: Suppose that $$S$$ is a finite set and $$x \\in S$$ is an element. Let $$S^- = \\{y^+ : (x, y) \\in S \\times S^+\\}$$. Then prove that $$S^- \\setminus \\{x\\}$$ is a proper subgroup. Since there are exactly two elements in $$S$$ that are the negative of an element in $$S$$, either $$x$$ or $$x^-$$, we take $$x$$ as the anchor element.\nLet $$S^-$$ and $$S^+$$ denote the sets of positive and negative elements in $$S$$, respectively. For all $$a, b \\in S$$ we have $$b - a \\in S^+$$. (If $$a < b$$, then $$b - a \\ \\text{doesn't}\\in S$$ because $$\\le$$ is not transitive.) For all $$c \\in S$$ and $$\\a$$, $$\\b$$ we have $$(c - \\a)(b - \\b) = cb - (b - a)(-c - b) = cb - (c - b)b = cb - c^2 = 0$$ because $$c \\neq -c$$ and $$b \\neq -b$$, and so $$c - \\a, \\b \\in S^+$$. For all $$a \\in S$$ and $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'$$, we have $$\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+ - \\a'^+$$ since $$(\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+) + (\\a^+ - \\a') = 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0$$, and so $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'^+$$. The element $$\\a$$ therefore lies in\nthe left coset $$S'a = \\left \\{ab : b^+ \\in S^+ \\text{ and } a = x_1x_2 x_3\\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4 x_5x_6\\dots \\right \\} \\subseteq S$$ Thus it lies in the subgroup $$H_a = \\left \\{ab : (x_1, b) \\in \\a^-\\times S' \\text{ for some }x_2 \\in S\\right \\}$$. Without loss of generality we can assume that $$1^+ \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots }$$. Suppose that $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ is not a subgroup. Then there exist $$a, b \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ such that $$a \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod {H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}}$$. By one of De Morgan's Laws, we can rewrite this as $$(ab+ba^{-1}) \\equiv 0 \\pmod {S}$$ because $$ba^{-1} \\in S^+$$ (since $$ba^{-1}$$ is an element in $$S^-$$).\nNote that the identity element $$0~\\0$$ must also be in $$S$$ (i.e., $$0~\\0 \\in Sz$$ for some $$z \\in S$$). This means that if $$S$$ does not already reason like an Abelian group, then it must add $$0~\\0$$ to its set to make it in an Abelian group, which is the same as saying that $$S'$$ adds $$0~\\0$$ to its coset space. The additive identity of an $$(s,t)~\\times~S$$-module can be determined by the truth table of $$~\\mathbb{B}^{2}~~$$ which would determine that there is an extra added element $$0~\\0$$ which doesn't actually add a new coset space and makes the set commutative. However, using $$0~\\0$$ doesn't add an additional coset space, so on the set $$S\\times S$$ we have that the group that is commutative is the following: $(0~\\0)(2~\\0) = (2~\\0)(0~\\0) = 0~\\0$, $(1~\\0)(3~\\0) = (3~\\0)(1~\\0) = 0~\\0$. No matter what other cosets to choose, the $$0~\\0$$ isn't used and because of the addition we have to only use the $$S\\times S$$ where the $$0~\\0$$ element exists in $$S\\times S$$.\nWe still need to show that there exists a subgroup that contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ is finite. Consider the $$S\\times S$$ where $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ are added. Then the addition of the identity element in this set is just $$0~\\0$$ so it will be commutative at least. (Note that we don't know that this commutative set contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$.) Then, all that is left is to show that this set's cosets are all distinct. Counting the number of cosets in this set: Every $$0~\\0$$ element multiplied by every positive element in $$\\a^-$$ means that there is every positive integer (except 0) coset of this set. All of their cosets are distinct, so this set has a subgroup, so $$S$$ must furthermore have a subgroup.\n\n(Note: The chapter book has a much easier and more specific arguement shown in Chapter 11: Proof of the Existence of the Inverse of an Element if the set it is a member of is Finite, since we can show all of that in s subset of a size $$n(A)$$ so that criteria is met. Because we do not have the candidate modulus range $$5, 6, etc..$$ that extends $$0~\\0$$ to infinite numbers given, this argument is far easier)\n\nWe postulate that every subgroup must include at least one negative element but since there are infinitely many elements is difficult to find what number is the one in that subgroup will that prove that a finite group has a subgroup. (Induction is especially bashy) Consider the proof given by Gaussian modulos 2: We show that for $$S'$$ it must have a sufficiently large set of coset space that must add a new set of coset space for for every $$i$$ doesn't exist an element $$0~in H_i$$ such that each $$H_i$$ $$\\notin S'$$ are distinct. Thus proving that this hypothesis is true and it should include $$S$$. We consider the following paremary (but deensand were insufficient) argument. Counting the number of new cosets in $$H_i$$ every singleton element multiplied by every positive element in that singleton means that there is every positive integer (but not including 0) coset of $$a_i$$ and that the argument is different every new singleton's are distinct meaning that any singleton new set of cosets are not in S, This new set is a $$\\subset S'$$ describable as $$(x, (x'+1))_i\\bmod k$$ with $$k$$ is an set of coset elements, we cannot constrain for $$x$$ because $$x$$ is allowed to be negative and as a result we know that often no $$x$$ element is allowed but we still know that there is an infinite set of elements (which the set must not need to guarantee such a subset) to make the subset comutaative, We can define a single coset $$x$$ as $$N(x_0)=\\{a+kx_0 a= a+(ax_0) a/(a+x_0)= a+x_1(x_0+x_0^2(x_0^3+x_0^4(x_0^5+x_0^6(x_0^7+\\dots+\\binom{n}{n\\ -1}x_n+\\dots+x_1(x_0^{\\n-1})))+x_0(x_0+x_0^2(x_"}
