Can you explain how you arrived at it based on the puzzle rule? I want to make sure I understand the logic behind it.\n\nAssistant: When solving this puzzle, one has to consider the rule that each row and column adds up to the number indicated at the end of the row or column.\n\nLet's look at the first row and column:\n\n-X + X + X = 26\n-31 + X + X + X = 33\n\nAs each number can only be used once in a grid, the non-filled squares in the first row can not have the numbers 31, 25, and 15 since these numbers are already used in the last row.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can fill the first row with numbers [5,6,7,8] and fill the first column with numbers [5, 6, 12]. With these numbers, the equation for the first row becomes `5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26` and for the first column becomes `5+6+12+8=31`.\n\nFollowing this process, we can step forward to fill all rows and columns with appropriate numbers.\n\nHuman: Okay, I see. So in the second row, we can't use the numbers from the first row and column as well. Let's see...\n\n-There's one X in the second row and two Xs in the second column. So to add up to 33, we need a combination of numbers that sums to 3.\n\n-Looking at the remaining available numbers, the only combination we can use is [2, 1, 0] or [3, 2, -1]. Since we need non-negative numbers, we should choose [2, 1, 0].\n\n-Filling in the second row with [2, 1, 0] and the second column with [2, 1], the equation for the second row becomes `2 + 1 + 0 = 3` and for the second column becomes `2 + 1 + 5 = 8`.\n\nThis continues for the other rows and columns until we have filled in the entire grid.\n\nAssistant: Yeah, that's exactly right! \n\nIn your example of the second row and column, you've correctly identified that only the combination of `[2,1,0]` gives a sum of 3 and will fit in the constraints given. Therefore, we proceed to fill the second row and the second column accordingly.\n\nYeah, the process is indeed that - every number contributes towards the sum of both the row and the column they're in. It's essentially solving simultaneous equations, taking into consideration the constraint that each number can only be used once. By using this method, we can work towards filling in the entire grid while adhering to the rules of the puzzle."}

The rule is gives a set of conditions about a puzzle grid layout. Solving the puzzle is your goal. \n\nThe rule states:\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid of n x n size, with skyscrapers in each cell.\n2. Skyscrapers' heights vary from 1 to the grid size.\n3. Two skyscrapers of the same height cannot exist in the same row or column.\n4. The numbers on the sides of the box indicate the number of skyscrapers that would be seen if you looked in the direction of the arrows, with taller buildings blocking the smaller ones.\n5. Fill the numbers in each cell to reflect the skyscrapers' heights.\n6. The topic consists of an n x n matrix filled with X, with the aforementioned numeric limitations affixed to the box's top and bottom.\n\nLooking at the first question:\n2        2        1        3        \n2        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        2        2        3        1       \nThe goal was to fill in the X's with numbers 1 to 4 (size of the grid), following the rules and given numbers on the edges. \n\nUsing the provided rules and edge numbers, the answer for the first question should be: \n[[3 1 4 2,2 4 3 1,4 2 1 3,1 3 2 4]]\n\nFor the other questions, the process is similar, where you fill in the Xs with numbers based on the edge clues given and following the rules."}
