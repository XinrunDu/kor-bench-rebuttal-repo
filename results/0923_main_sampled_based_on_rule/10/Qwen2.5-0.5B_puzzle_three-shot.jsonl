Let's break down the problem step by step for each row and ensure that the logic aligns with the given rule:\n\n#### Rule Breakdown:\n1. **Pre-filled Grid Rule:**\n   - The grid is pre-filled with numbers, with each row and column having a number at the end indicating the sum of those rows or columns.\n   - This means the sum of the numbers in each row/column is given.\n\n2. **Player Needs to Fill Spaces with Specific Set of Numbers:**\n   - The player needs to fill the remaining spaces with a preset set of numbers.\n\n3. **Each Number Can Only Be Used Once:**\n   - No number can be repeated within the same row or column.\n\n4. **Sum of the Numbers in Each Row and Column Matches Intended Sum:**\n   - The sum of the numbers in each row and column must match the intended sum.\n\n5. **Numbers Must Be Filled Such That the Sum of the Numbers in Each Row and Column Matches the Intended Sum:**\n   - Each number must be used exactly once.\n\n6. **Final Matrix Is Given To Be Formatted:**\n   - The puzzle is given in the form of a matrix with blank squares filled with X and the player replaces the squares with numbers.\n\n#### Temporary Matrix Setup:\nFor simplicity, let's assume a temporary matrix format for visualization and restatement:\n\n| X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n| X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\n\nWe will then apply the logic in subsequent steps focusing on the specific format and definitions provided in the puzzle.\n\n### Applying Rules:\n\n1. **Initial Grid Setup:**\n   - Pre-filled grid setup:\n     ```plaintext\n     3  X  X  X  17\n     X  X  X  X  24\n     X  X  X  X  37\n     15  25  29  9\n     7  12  38  26\n     [\n      23  67  72  00\n      53  72  51  09\n      28 13 40  0\n      ---\n      25 10 33 3 12 0\n      75 45 72 07 1 0\n      48 80 97 25 679 0\n      ---\n      33 3 38 46 94 53 -2 5 -1 49 57 72\n      45 77 97 23 70 28 1 10 50 15 72 54\n      8  16 94 27 37 71 1 23 28 46 53 18\n      ---\n      13 17 28 23 3 98 7 53 56 27 48 13 11\n      22 43 30 98 51 39 52 25 48 13 23 37 21\n      89 12 7 25  5  4 3 91 80 45 38 13 11 23\n      ---\n      27 07 25 11 10 4 29 53 06 12 78 10 42 15\n      15 91 16 17  3 7 25 33 02 38 15 15 28 42\n      48 72 54 37 10 11 28 23 00 28 12 11 12 80\n      ---\n      22  98 25 10  4 23 07 28 13 31 3 7 26 43\n      27 28 20 12 10 11 09 20 16 23 13 02 11 80\n      12  13  8  7 11 12  6 12 11 10 15 9 23 89\n      ---\n      06  49 13 11 27 02  9 10 13 13 23 10 20 45\n      51 15 48 54 78 28  4 17 23 32 08 60 22 43\n      37 08 29 15  2  7 28 27 18 22 34 3 51 40\n      ---\n      01 16 23 10 23 26 13 16 15 25 10 12 21 3 7\n      0 , .\n      _ .\n      _ .\n      _ .\n      []]\n\n     ---\n     25 10 33 3 12 0\n     75 45 72 07 1 0\n     48 80 97 25 679 0\n     ---\n     33 3 38 46 94 53 -2 5 -1 49 57 72\n     45 77 97 23 70 28 1 10 50 15 72 54\n     8  16 94 27 37 71 1 23 28 46 53 18\n     ---\n     13 17 28 23 3 98 7 53 56 27 48 13 11\n     22 43 30 98 51 39 52 25 48 13 23 37 21\n     89 12 7 25  5 "}
