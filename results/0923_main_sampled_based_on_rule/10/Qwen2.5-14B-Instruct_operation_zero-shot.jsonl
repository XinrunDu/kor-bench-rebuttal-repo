Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the equation \\(0★b=b\\) under the given operation rule, we need to incorporate the integral definition into the equation and solve for \\(b\\).\n\nGiven the operation rule:\n\\[ a★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx \\]\n\nWe substitute \\(a=0\\) and set up the equation:\n\\[ 0★b=\\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx = b \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx \\]\n\nLet's calculate the integral:\n\\[ \\int 2x \\, dx = x^2 + C \\]\n\nSo evaluating the definite integral from 0 to \\(b\\), we get:\n\\[ \\left[x^2\\right]_0^b = b^2 - 0^2 = b^2 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\\[ b^2 = b \\]\n\nThis simplifies to the equation:\n\\[ b^2 - b = 0 \\]\n\\[ b(b - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nFrom the above equation, \\(b\\) can be either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\n\nHence, the possible values for \\(b\\) are:\n\\[ [[0 or 1]] \\]"}
