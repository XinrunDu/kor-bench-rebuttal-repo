However, according to the rule, Y should be a real number. So the structure of the question has an issue, it should be corrected to find the real part of Y. But to strictly answer the question following the rule, the answer would be a complex number, contrary to the requested format. If it's strictly for the real part: [[the result is incorrect based on the provided rule and the question structure]].\n\nHowever, it seems there's a misunderstanding or an error in the question's structure as it's asking for a real number where the result provided is a complex number. The question should be restructured to fit the correct rule format for a real number solution. ]]\n\n\n\n### Question:\nIf (X⊕5)×(2⊕4)=?\nThe answer should be given in the form of x + yi.\nIt seems there's no structure in the question for a valid inquiry, how should this be answered following the rule?\n\n### Answer:\nAs per the instructions and given rules, the operation a⊕b=a+bi involves a real number a and a real number b. It produces a complex number a+bi. The question, \"(X⊕5)×(2⊕4)=?\", without any specific value for X or operation direction isn't easily solvable in the context of the provided rule since it lacks a defined process that follows the rule strictly.\n\nFrom the defined rule, (X⊕5) would result in X+5i, and (2⊕4) would result in 2+4i. However, the multiplication of these does not follow the same pattern as the operation rule, as it seems to imply the multiplication of two complex numbers, which is not directly defined here.\n\nGiven the rule a⊕b=a+bi and without additional guidance on how to handle multiplication of results of this operation, I would suggest:\n- If we strictly follow the rule and define the result of the operation as a complex number, the multiplication of complex numbers would follow standard complex number multiplication rules, leading to a more complex structure than the rule's single \"a+bi\" form.\n- If we interpret the operation as strictly needing to fit the form directly and X needs to be a number (either real or implied complex), then we'd need to work back or define specific rules for such operations, which are not given here.\n\nGiven the setup and for a direct answer following the rule narrowly, the question seems to imply an undefined or complex operation stemming from the rule defined. Creating such a structure accurately and ensuring it adheres to the rule is impossible with the given information. [[Question structure requires refinement for a precise answer within the defined rule]]\n\nIf there's a specific way you'd like to approach interpreting or defining this operation's multiplication within the given rule's context, please adjust the question's guidelines accordingly, so I can provide a more accurate and relevant answer."}

Let's analyze each question step by step to ensure the proper application of the rule.\n\n### Question 1:\nThe custom operation a◎b = (a + bi)^2. We need to compute (4◎1) + (2◎3).\n\n1. **Calculate 4◎1:**\n   \\[\n   4◎1 = (4 + 1i)^2 = 4^2 + 2(4)(1i) + (1i)^2 = 16 + 8i + 1 = 17 + 8i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate 2◎3:**\n   \\[\n   2◎3 = (2 + 3i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(3i) + (3i)^2 = 4 + 12i + 9 = 13 + 12i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the results:**\n   \\[\n   (4◎1) + (2◎3) = (17 + 8i) + (13 + 12i) = 30 + 20i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{[30+20i]}\\).\n\n### Question 2:\nThe custom operation a◎b = (a + bi)^2. We need to compute (2◎1) - (2◎2).\n\n1. **Calculate 2◎1:**\n   \\[\n   2◎1 = (2 + 1i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(1i) + (1i)^2 = 4 + 4i + 1 = 5 + 4i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate 2◎2:**\n   \\[\n   2◎2 = (2 + 2i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(2i) + (2i)^2 = 4 + 8i + 4 = 8 + 8i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the results:**\n   \\[\n   (2◎1) - (2◎2) = (5 + 4i) - (8 + 8i) = 5 + 4i - 8 - 8i = -3 - 4i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{[-3-4i]}\\).\n\n### Question 3:\nThe custom operation a◎b = (a + bi)^2. We need to find X if (1◎3) + (X◎2) = -8 + 14i.\n\n1. **Calculate 1◎3:**\n   \\[\n   1◎3 = (1 + 3i)^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(3i) + (3i)^2 = 1 + 6i + 9 = 10 + 6i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the equation:**\n   \\[\n   10 + 6i + (X◎2) = -8 + 14i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate X◎2:**\n   \\[\n   (X + 2i)^2 = X^2 + 2(X)(2i) + (2i)^2 = X^2 + 4Xi - 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   10 + 6i + (X^2 + 4Xi - 4) = -8 + 14i\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify:**\n   \\[\n   6 + 6i + X^2 + 4Xi = -8 + 14i\n   \\]\n\n6. **Separate real and imaginary parts:**\n   \\[\n   X^2 - 6 + 4Xi + 6i = -8 + 14i\n   \\]\n\n7. **Equate the real and imaginary parts:**\n   \\[\n   X^2 - 6 = -8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4Xi + 6i = 14i\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solve for X:**\n   \\[\n   X^2 - 6 = -8 \\implies X^2 = -2 \\quad \\text{(No real solution)}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{[2]}\\).\n\n### Question 4:\nThe custom operation a◎b = (a + bi)^2. We need to compute (1◎1) × (2◎2).\n\n1. **Calculate 1◎1:**\n   \\[\n   1◎1 = (1 + 1i)^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(1i) + (1i)^2 = 1 + 2i + 1 = 2 + 2i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate 2◎2:**\n   \\[\n   2◎2 = (2 + 2i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(2i) + (2i)^2 = 4 + 8i + 4 = 8 + 8i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the results:**\n   \\[\n   (1◎1) \\times (2◎2) = (2 + 2i)(8 + 8i) = 2(8) + 2(8i) + 2i(8) + 2i(8i) = 16 + 16i + 16i + 16i^2 = 16 + 32i + 16(-1) = 16 + 32i - 16 = 32i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{[32i]}\\)."}

If the energy consumption varies sinusoidally with time, reaching its maximum at 6 kilowatts and minimum at 3 kilowatts, find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner.\n\nTo find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, we first need to understand the formula for the average of a sinusoidal function. The function is given as f(t) = Asin(ωt), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. However, the function provided is not directly in the form of a sine wave. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the extreme values of the function, which are 6 kW and 3 kW. Hence, the amplitude A of the sinusoidal function can be:\n\nA = (max - min) / 2\nA = (6 - 3) / 2\nA = 3 / 2\n\nTherefore, the function becomes:\n\nf(t) = 3/2 * sin(ωt)\n\nNow, let us determine the average energy consumption of this sinusoidal function over the eight-hour period. The average value of a function f(t) over an interval [a, b] can be determined by integrating the function over this interval and then dividing by the length of the interval.\n\nThe total energy consumed in eight hours is 6 kW, which translates to:\n\nE = ∫0^8 kf(t) dt = 6 kWh\n\nIn order to find the average energy consumption, we will calculate the integral of the function f(t) over the interval [0, 8] and divide by the interval's length, which is 8 hours.\n\nHowever, finding the integral of a sinusoidal function can be tricky without specific information about the time period of the function. If the sinusoidal function's time period is unknown, we can consider the most basic scenario where the function completes one cycle over the interval [0, 8]. In this case, the average energy consumption will be the average of the function's maximum and minimum values, which is:\n\naverage = (max + min) / 2\naverage = (6 + 3) / 2\naverage = 9 / 2\naverage = 4.5 kW\n\nTherefore, the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, considering it will be 4.5 kW if the function's time period is equal to the interval [0, 8].\n\nThe ball's height in feet above the ground is given by the expression y=-2x2+4x+18, where x is the horizontal distance in feet from where it was thrown. When the ball touches the ground, the horizontal measurement from where it was thrown is [[the_answer]].\n\nThe parabola is only touching the ground at the vertex x=-b/2a, which is x=-4/2(-2)=1.\nThe answer is: 1"}
