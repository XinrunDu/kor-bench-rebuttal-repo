Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers. This is a logical puzzle. Do not use rules unrelated to this specific kind of puzzle. If you answer the question with an explanation, sometimes the answer to this question is yes or no. In this case, you must give your clue to yourself after [[yes]] or [[no]], then proceed.\n\nYou cannot explain your own clue and puzzle anymore. You can not respond with anything other than a number like -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3… or multiple numbers like [[-4,-3]], [[-4,-3,33,234,43]] (without white space). You can't make supporter sentences or answer other than what I requested. I speak Korean as my first language, and so I can read hangul writing, but please write in english as much as possible.

The modulus of a positive and negative number has the same value. Remove the negative sign if necessary. Output the absolute value of the symmetrical value. If the output result converges to only one number after removing multiple symmetrical values, it means that an integer is a convergent number."}
