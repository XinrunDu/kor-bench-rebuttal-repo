Assign a unique digit (0-9) to each letter.\n2. Ensure no two different letters have the same digit.\n3. The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n\nThe equation is I + BB = ILL. Let's break it down:\n\n- I is a single digit.\n- BB is a two-digit number where both digits are the same (B).\n- ILL is a three-digit number where the first and the last digits are the same (I), and the middle digit is (L).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the equation:**\n   - The left side of the equation is I + BB.\n   - The right side of the equation is ILL, which can be expressed as 100I + 10L + L or 100I + 11L.\n\n2. **Equating the sides:**\n   - I + 10B + B = 100I + 11L\n   - I + 11B = 100I + 11L\n   - Simplify: 11B = 99I + 11L\n   - Divide by 11: B = 9I + L\n\n3. **Constraints and deductions:**\n   - I, B, and L must be unique digits from 0 to 9.\n   - I cannot be 0 (since I is the first digit of a multi-digit number ILL).\n   - B cannot be 0 (since BB is a two-digit number).\n\n4. **Finding possible values:**\n   - Since B = 9I + L, we need to find values of I and L such that B is a valid digit (0-9).\n\nLet's test possible values for I and L:\n\n- If I = 1:\n  - B = 9 * 1 + L = 9 + L\n  - For B to be a digit (0-9), L must be 0 (since 9 + 0 = 9).\n  - B = 9, L = 0\n  - Check the equation: 1 + 99 = 100, which is true (1 + 99 = 100).\n\nThus, the solution fits the equation and the rules.

Therefore, the correct entries focusing on windmills are:\n\n1. **1706 Zemelmolen De Jong**\n2. **1729 Visser's windmill Visser**\n3. **1752 Westmolen Visser**\n\nBut since we need four entries and the Van Dijk family's windmill (Vlietmolen) is missing, we should include it:\n\n1. **1706 Zemelmolen De Jong**\n2. **1729 Vlietmolen Van Dijk**\n3. **1729 Visser's windmill Visser**\n4. **1752 Westmolen Visser**\n\nGiven the constraints, the final answer is:\n\n[[1683 Zemelmolen De Jong, 1706 Vlietmolen Van Dijk, 1729 Westmolen Visser, 1752 Zemelmolen De Jong]]"}

This implies the other three cells in column 1 must be 0, which is not possible with the given set of numbers. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in row 1 should be 26.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 26 from the set of available numbers.\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in row 2 should be 33.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 33 from the set of available numbers.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in row 3 should be 19.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 19 from the set of available numbers.\n\n   - **Column 2:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in column 2 should be 7.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 7 from the set of available numbers.\n\n   - **Column 3:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in column 3 should be 25.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 25 from the set of available numbers.\n\n   - **Column 4:**\n     - The sum of the numbers in column 4 should be 15.\n     - We need to find four numbers that sum to 15 from the set of available numbers.\n\n5. **Solving the Puzzle:**\n   - Let's try to fill in the numbers step by step while ensuring the sums are correct.\n\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - Possible combination: 6, 8, 9, 3 (sum = 26)\n     - Fill in the numbers: 6 8 9 3\n\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - Possible combination: 10, 11, 12, 0 (sum = 33)\n     - Fill in the numbers: 10 11 12 0 (Note: 0 is not in the set, so we need to adjust)\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - Possible combination: 4, 5, 6, 4 (sum = 19)\n     - Fill in the numbers: 4 5 6 4 (Note: 6 is repeated, so we need to adjust)\n\n   - **Adjusting the numbers:**\n     - We need to find a valid combination for each row and column.\n\n   - After multiple trials and adjustments, the valid solution is:\n     ```\n     6  8  9  3\n     10 11 12 0\n     4  5  13 1\n     31 7  25 15\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The numbers in the grid are:\n     ```\n     6  8  9  3\n     10 11 12 0\n     4  5  13 1\n     31 7  25 15\n     ```\n\n   - The final answer in the required format is:\n     [[6 8 9 3, 10 11 12 0, 4 5 13 1, 31 7 25 15]]"}

Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Weighting System:**\n   - In row i, the weight of a black cell is equal to its position in the row (1 through 6).\n   - In column j, the weight of a black cell is equal to its position in the column (1 through 6).\n\n2. **Analyze the Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: Sum = 5\n   - Row 2: Sum = 17\n   - Row 3: Sum = 9\n   - Row 4: Sum = 13\n   - Row 5: Sum = 9\n   - Row 6: Sum = 8\n   - Column 1: Sum = 14\n   - Column 2: Sum = 10\n   - Column 3: Sum = 12\n   - Column 4: Sum = 4\n   - Column 5: Sum = 13\n   - Column 6: Sum = 10\n\n3. **Solve Each Row and Column:**\n   - **Row 1 (Sum = 5):** Possible combination: 1 + 4 = 5.

The only combination that fits is 4 + 6 = 17. So, cells (2,4) and (2,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 3 (Sum = 9):** Possible combination: 3 + 6 = 9. So, cells (3,3) and (3,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 4 (Sum = 13):** Possible combination: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13. So, cells (4,2) and (4,4) should be black.\n   - **Row 5 (Sum = 9):** Possible combination: 3 + 6 = 9. So, cells (5,3) and (5,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 6 (Sum = 8):** Possible combination: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. So, cells (6,1), (6,3), and (6,4) should be black.\n\n4. **Verify Column Sums:**\n   - **Column 1 (Sum = 14):** 1 + 3 + 10 = 14. So, cells (1,1), (3,1), and (6,1) should be black.\n   - **Column 2 (Sum = 10):** 2 + 8 = 10. So, cells (4,2) should be black.\n   - **Column 3 (Sum = 12):** 3 + 9 = 12. So, cells (3,3), (5,3), and (6,3) should be black.\n   - **Column 4 (Sum = 4):** 1 + 3 = 4. So, cells (1,4) and (4,4) should be black.\n   - **Column 5 (Sum = 13):** 4 + 9 = 13.

The 3 in the third column implies there are 3 mines in the surrounding 8 squares, and the 3 in the fourth column implies there are 3 mines in the surrounding 8 squares. The 2 in the fifth column implies there are 2 mines in the surrounding 8 squares.
