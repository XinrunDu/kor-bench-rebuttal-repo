We can place (5,3), (4,3), and (3,3) to make 1+1+1+1+1=5, 2+2+2=6, and 3+3=6, thus 5+6=11 and we need 1 more.

Similarly, the columns (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,2) indicate that the first 8 columns must each have exactly 1 tent, and the 9th column must have 2 tents.\n\nNow, place the tents following the constraints:\n\n- For row 1 (3): We need 3 tents. The only available positions that are orthogonally adjacent to a tree are (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). Place tents here.\n- For row 2 (1): We need 1 tent. The only available position is (2,6). Place a tent here.\n- For row 3 (2): We need 2 tents. The only available positions are (3,2) and (3,7). Place tents here.\n- For row 4 (3): We need 3 tents. The only available positions are (4,1), (4,2), and (4,7). Place tents here.\n- For row 5 (1): We need 1 tent. The only available position is (5,1). Place a tent here.\n\nNow let's verify the columns:\n\n- For column 1 (1): We need 1 tent. It is already placed in row 5 (1,1).\n- For column 2 (1): We need 1 tent. It is already placed in row 3 (3,2).\n- For column 3 (1): We need 1 tent. It is already placed in row 1 (1,3).\n- For column 4 (3): We need 3 tents. They are already placed in rows 1 (1,4), 4 (4,4), and 5 (5,4).\n- For column 5 (2): We need 2 tents. They are already placed in rows 2 (2,5) and 4 (4,5).\n- For column 6 (1): We need 1 tent. It is already placed in row 2 (2,6).\n- For column 7 (1): We need 1 tent. It is already placed in row 3 (3,7).\n- For column 8 (1): We need 1 tent.
