Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the problem, we will follow the given instructions and apply the custom operation rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2 x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0 ★b=b, find b.\n\nGiven the rule, let's find the expression for 0 ★b:\n\n0 ★b=\\int_{0}^{b} 2 x \\, dx\n\nWe know that 0 ★b=b, so:\n\nb=\\int_{0}^{b} 2 x \\, dx\n\nNow we need to solve this integral equation for b.\n\n\\int_{0}^{b} 2 x \\, dx = 2 \\int_{0}^{b} x \\, dx = 2 \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{b} = [x^2]_{0}^{b} = (b^2) - (0^2) = b^2\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb = b^2\n\nTo find the value(s) of b, we will solve the equation:\n\nb^2 = b\n\nWe can factor the left side of the equation:\n\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\nb = 0 or b - 1 = 0 => b = 1\n\nSo, the values of b that satisfy the given condition are 0 and 1.\n\n### Answer:\n[[0 or 1]]"}
