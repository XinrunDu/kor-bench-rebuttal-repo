It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k"}

The initial grid consists of blank cells (X), and your task is to fill them with black cells (1) according to the number constraints provided below and to the right of the grid. Each row and column's weight sums must equal the given numbers in the row and column constraints. The weight of each black cell is determined by its position within the row or column.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, navigate through the rows and columns, filling black cells according to the constraints. Remember to check if the filled cells align with the weight conditions. Here's how you can solve the \"Blackening Of Squares\" puzzle:\n\nStarting with the first row and column, focus on row 1, column 1. The sum for the first column is 3, and the sum for the first row is 8. This means you cannot place black cells in rows 1 and 3 of the first column.\n\nUsing this information, fill in the black cells accordingly. If you encounter a scenario where the given number's weight doesn't fit in the available position, continue to the next row or column and attempt to find a solution based on that. All rows and columns must contain at least one black cell.\n\nRemember not to overlap black cells, or their weight value won't be considered when adding it to the row or column. If you're stuck, consider starting from the top and moving downwards, focusing on the rows and columns' requirements.\n\nAnswer: Remember to follow the rules while solving this puzzle. sum the weight of the black cell therefore fill out the Blacken Squares for that type void and Dont't consider overlap squares and surpass all your Rows and Columns sums must comply by colouring flags such as squares values should be  upon this rule you can solve this question successfully out here.\n\n### Question:\nX        X        X        X        1\nX        X        X        X        7\nX        X        X        X        3\nX        X        X        X        4\n5        6        8        6        \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

Hopefully, the second and third words will find me the correct answers!\ncomment 1: I adapted your question for ChatGPT 4. Schocking that it failed :\n\nHere is the conversation with ChatGPT 4 with that question:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nHow can we solve the following Minesweeper problem?\n\nWe want to use the Monte Carlo method which is a sequential learning method.\n\nBlacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Guess the value of each square of the flag. The expected value is the average of the squares.\n\nIn each circle, we place one flag. The expected value for each circle is the average of all blackened squares from all other circles.\n\nHow many puzzles can we solve by this method, defining the Monte Carlo method for solving a Minesweeper mastermind problem?\n\nDifferent types of puzzles, e.g. square puzzles, can be solved by this method as well.\n\nCan you create a rule to solve such a puzzle independently of its type as shown in the example above?\n\n**First and most important rule:** Make sure the first and second lines have three squares marked with a flag, i.e. the first line has three squares marked, and the second line has three squares marked.\n\nThe conditional probability P(flag at center square) \\~\\~ does not seem to be good when a circle gap is removed. If the conditional probability P(flag at center square) was close to 0, you would be able to remove a circle only with this rule and a fixed value of the conditional probability P(flag at center square). Thus, the conditional probability P(flag at center square) needs to change depending on a circle gap.\n\nI wrote two rules to deal with this problem.\n\n**The second rule:** First, we apply the first rule, i.e. flag at center square is on. If P(flag at center square=/P(flag at center square), we remove the circle gap so that the flag at center square is off.\n\nThen the conditional probability P(flag at center square)(/P(flag at center square) becomes close to 0, and we remove the circle gap again so that the conditional probability P(flag at center square) can change depending on a circle gap.\n\nIn this example, we got the following output:\n\nIn the center square, we have three flags.\n\n#3\n\nOn the left middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#8\n\nOn the right middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#1\n\nOn the right side fill with any of these squares, then I have a problem.\n\n#2\n\nOn the left side fill with any of these squares.\n\n#3\n\nCan you solve the above problem automatically? We are building a chatbot that can solve such problems automatically. For your understanding, try solving this problem yourself.\n\n#4\n\nI noticed that the flags are just circle gaps, we will solve this problem.\n\n#1: The square is a black square.\n\n#2: The square is a red square.\n\n#3: The square is a grey square.\n\n#4: The square is a glyph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nAs you have stated, I will attempt to solve this problem automatically.\n\nIf I understand the puzzle correctly, we are given a 4x3 square grid with numbers on the outer rows and columns that indicate the sum of the values of the squares in that row or column. We must blacken some squares in the grid such that the sum of the values in each row and column matches that indicated by the numbers on the row or column.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we will randomly blacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Let's consider the corner square as the center square in a 3x3 square. If the conditional probability of there being a flag in the center square is close to zero, we will remove the circle at the center square. If the conditional probability remains close to zero, we will add a square gap to that side that makes the conditional probability higher.\n\nIf we follow this algorithm, we can solve this puzzle using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nI don't understand why you assume the first and second lines should have three flags. Tell me why? I didn't assume that they should have 3 flags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to assume that the first and second lines should have three flags. The example you provided has three flags in the first line and two flags in the second line, so I used those as the starting numbers.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we can randomly blacken different combinations of squares until we find one that meets the conditions of the puzzle.

Specify the size of the puzzle:\n\nEnter the dimensions of the custom puzzle. The puzzle size is defined by two positive integers representing the number of rows and columns. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: An 8x8 puzzle would require you to enter \"8\" twice, separated by commas, in the format \"8,8\" without quotes.\n\n3. Insert clues in a one-dimensional list:\n\nAssociate each specified vertical clue with the corresponding row, from top to bottom. This input field is required.\n\nExample: For an 8x8 puzzle with three vertical clues, enter data in the format \"8,4,8\" without quotes, separated by commas, to match with the top, middle, and bottom rows, respectively.\n\nNote: A specified clue means that you know the value of all cells in a row for a horizontal clue, and all cells in a column for a vertical clue.\n\n1. After entering the above four required parameters, click \"Generate Wall\", and the wall problem and answer will be obtained.\n\n## References\n\n• Tebib, S.

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n"}
