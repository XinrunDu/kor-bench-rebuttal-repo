Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the question \"If 0 ★b=b, find b,\" we need to use the definition of the custom operation a★b given in the rule:\n\na★b = \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\nHere, a = 0 and a★b = b, so we can write:\n\n0★b = \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx = b\n\nNow, we need to solve the integral:\n\n\\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx = \\left[x^2\\right]_{0}^{b}\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\n(b^2 - 0^2) = b^2\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb^2 = b\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for b:\n\nb^2 - b = 0\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us two solutions for b:\n\nb = 0 or b = 1\n\nSince the question does not specify whether b must be non-zero (as it usually is when defining a range or interval), both solutions are valid. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n[[b = 0 or b = 1]]"}
