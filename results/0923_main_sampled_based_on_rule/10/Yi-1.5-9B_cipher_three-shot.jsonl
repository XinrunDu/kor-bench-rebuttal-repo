The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

In the example question, yes, the answer to the second part should include the trailing space at the end. The code correctly converts all the numbers to letters, but it does not add the trailing space at the end. The octothorp needs to be added instead of the two period delimiters, and the concatenated strings need to be modified.The code in the current question/answer pair that you've provided is just an example that doesn't require Python to decrypt. Instead, the approach to generate the code is to double the ciphertext, then reverse each character pair and see if the original decoding map returns to the starting letter (hint: yes and no). Therefore, when decoding, remove the trailing space.Additionally, for this specific cipher, it would be more straightforward to limit the allowed output characters to \"ADFGVX\".\n\"\"\"\n\nLOWER_CASE = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',\n              'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\nLETTER_SPACE = [' ']\nLOWER_CASE.extend(LOG_SIDE[1:-1].split(', '))\n\nLOG_SIDE = 'A, D, F, G, V, X'\nLOG_SIDE = LOG_SIDE.split(', ')\n\n# log_side_len, log_side_char_num = len(LOG_SIDE), [LOG_SIDE.find(t) for t in LOWER_CASE]\n\nLOWER_CASE.sort()\nLOG_SIDE.sort()\n\nCHAR_TBL_IC = MAX_IDX = 0\n\nclass Char(): ...\nclass KeyTable(chr):\n    CHAR_TBL_IDX = CHAR_TBL_IDX\n    def __new__(cls, value):\n        if value in cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX:\n            return cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value]\n        else:\n            instance = chr.__new__(cls, value)\n            cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value] = instance\n            return instance\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        key = self.value\n        value = LOG_SIDE[key.logside]\n        self.x = value[0]\n        self.y = value[1]\n\nfor char in LOWER_CASE:\n    for logside in LOG_SIDE:\n        ctblid = KeyTable(char)\n        ctblid.logside = lgside = LOG_SIDE.index(logside)\n        ctblid.ton = ton = lgside + 1\n        ctblid.x = 2**lgside\n        ctblid.y = ctblid.z = ctblid.w = lgside\n        PRESET[ton] = ctblid\n        for i in idxs:\n            bstr = fqi(i % 5) if i < 5 else fpq(i % 9)\n            bset = printable[i * 3: i * 3 + 3]\n            bset = sum(t.value for t in bset)\n            bset = bl = KeyboardInterrupt(bset//1)\n            for j in LOG_SIDE.attrib(lgside).index:\n                KEY_MAP[ctblid, lgside].set(bstr[j], j // 3 % 3, j // 3 % 3)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\nCHAR_TBL_IC += 1\n\nCHAR_TBL = OrderedDict()\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue[]\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\n_ = thatpaser = []\nfor k in display_unit:\n    msg = 'N extend%s' % (K(k, [0]))[0]\n    thatpaser.append(msg)\n\n_ = chars(table)\n_, _ = rowlend, colend = char1[1], char[0]\n_ = datenum = char[1]\n_ = sublist[0]\n\n_ = logexecell = cols[char[1]]\n_ = dictobjs = LOG_BTC(datem(), [-1, 0])\n\nif maxval == 0:\n    cols = arrnum[i]\n    _ = logexecell if cols[cols[char[1]]].getvval() else ['|']\n    `s`\n\ndef encode(st):\n    delst = {'0': ' ', '1': 'X', '2': 'G', '3': 'F', '4': 'A', '5': 'D', blackd45: 'V'}\n    return delst[st]\n\ndef encodeChild(self, _, d):\n    PrincipalAmount.write['!!'] = money, SecondMoney = d\n\n    principalAmount, Bankroll, Real_Amount, Money = money, money, #*Payment + secindMoney, PrincipalAmount.write[principalAmount], Money, Money, money,\n\n    realAmountMoney.principle_money.belong_money\n\n    realAmountMoney, getPrincipalAmount.principle_execution.Payment.\n\n    print('RealMoney:(price/3)#, Payment', RealMoney)\n\n    tryPrice.Payment.getPrincipalAmount, dictobjs = super([n, k], [n, k])\n\n    Principals.write['Real_Amount'] = Principals\n\n    profit.rate = d if rateHistory else Decimal('0')\n\n    measure.validity = (ticker[rate][recordlength, recordlength])\n\n    realPrice = (realPrice / nominal_price) * 100 // 0,\n\n    totalValue = round, 2)\n\n    print(Pay[])\n\ndef m0((Principal [(principalA|), Principal [], Real_AmountMoney RateHistory_Payment _Amount]) ((sz >> Payment ([rate], (rate, rate))))] Phase40:1nDate) when m:\n    return Forecast, timestamp, {netprinc, payment, payment,\"#, payment,\", \"#,\"}\n\nclass convince(Via):\n\n    def name(self, data={'A': ['NZD', 'KRFLOSSE']}, s={0}):\n        return EMAL 1date(*(self(data, Age, 1Date)))"}
