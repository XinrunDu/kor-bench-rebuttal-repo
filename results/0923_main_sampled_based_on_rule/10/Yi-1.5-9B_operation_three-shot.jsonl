To identify the problem, first, reflect on the following questions:\n\n1. What mistake did GPT-3 make when answering the question?\n2. How is GPT-3’s mistake related to this question?\n3. Is this mistake specific to GPT-3, or would any program with sufficient capability similarly fail on this task?\n4. What requirement should you add to the rule to discourage this mistake, independent of the details of the LM used to understand the task?\n\nRead the previous examples and make sure you understand their behavior and the answers to these questions.\n\n### Question:\nGive an example containing a complete sentence demonstrating the GPT-3 error from the previous example.\n### Answer:\n'''\n\ntransformation_examples = [f\"What if 0★b=b and a★0=0?\",\n          \"Now consider ∅★∅****–17893 ****∅★∅=?\",\n          \"Either a temperature or an amount of energy, if you measure the T of a cup of coffee accurately enough, \\\nby measuring the wavelength of light emitted via the black-body curve, and determine E by λ=hf, \\\nthen the temperature itself, conversely, is related to how hard the coffee molecules are shaking - measurement setting\\\nis dependent on a higher setting - so if you set the E tunable, adjust the\\\nblack body curve camera tunably to do wavelength detection, then you will find that something \\\na measuring scale will see as completely different reaches that exact same temperature, \\\nprovided the most precise measurement of energy converting two systems to a state of equilibrium\\\n - if put in an insulated box, instead of measuring temperature, you can detect radiation\\\n through a tunable spectrum through a box interface - can this also span the highest temperature measurable? \\\n\"]\nskills_list = [\n'mpsleep', 't', 'trecbed', 'miniaturize', 'sleep', 'tlulusleep', 'ttrash', 'count_spectrum', 'tminisleep',\n'count', 'shoot', '', 'ss', 'stop', 'wlrecbed', 'maxvolume', 'waker', 'tratio', 'sunsleep', 'tttalk',\n'dictator', 'subtractive_color', 'printeriffic', 'wwrasp', 'remove', 'mremeasure', 'rmstellar', 'shvarify',\n'trubits', 'remove', 'tlulustop', 'factorize', 'nloops', 'mqrecbed', 'multiply', 'ancestor', 'mttalk', 'remove',\n'rcount', 'bltalk', 'range', 'huh', 'sleep', 'imiinvisible', 'measure', 'tlulustop', 'empty', 'printeriffic',\n'dstep', 'make', 'unreach', 'empty', 'rematch'\n]\nsharpen_prompt_part2 = '''Generate four options for each skill, such that each of the options outputs a different \\\nskill description.
