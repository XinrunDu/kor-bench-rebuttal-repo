Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIf the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is what?\nIf the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is what?\nIf the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\nIf the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[true/false];[true/false];[true/false];[true/false]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze each part step by step based on the given logic rules:\n\n1. If SIP is false, then SOP is what?\n   SIP and SOP have an & Relation. If one is false, the other is true.\n   So, if SIP is false, SOP must be true.\n\n2. If SOP is false, then SIP is what?\n   Again, SIP and SOP have an & Relation. If one is false, the other is true.\n   So, if SOP is false, SIP must be true.\n\n3. If SAP is true, then SEP is what?\n   SAP and SEP have a # Relation. If one is true, the other is false.\n   So, if SAP is true, SEP must be false.\n\n4. If SEP is true, then SAP is what?\n   Again, SAP and SEP have a # Relation. If one is true, the other is false.\n   So, if SEP is true, SAP must be false.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[true];[true];[false];[false]]"}

The logical consequence of these hypotheses (r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 r_3) is also considered reasonable.\n4.

Instead, we need to reevaluate all the hypotheses, including r_1, r_2, and r_3, in light of the new contradictory information provided by r_4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]\n\nThis approach aligns with the conclusion of the LS Paradox, which states that in such cases, we need to find a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness to avoid contradiction. Reevaluating all hypotheses allows us to critically examine our existing beliefs and potentially update them based on new evidence or information."}

For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\n\"Looking at the history of the development of science and technology around the world, many scientists' important inventions and creations were made during their prime, when their thinking was most agile. Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions. Natural science is like this, and many outstanding social scientists and politicians have also basically created their outstanding achievements from a young age.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The argumentation method used in this passage is [[A]], which corresponds to the E+ Method.\n\nThis method is defined as \"Using specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition.\" The passage clearly employs this strategy by listing numerous examples of scientists and their groundbreaking achievements, all accomplished at relatively young ages.\n\nThe text provides specific instances of:\n\n1. Copernicus proposing the heliocentric theory at 38\n2. Newton and Leibniz inventing calculus at 22 and 28 respectively\n3. Darwin writing \"On the Origin of Species\" based on observations from his voyage at 22\n4. Edison inventing the phonograph at 29 and the light bulb at 31\n5. Bell inventing the telephone at 29\n6. The Curies making their discoveries and winning Nobel Prizes in their 30s and 40s\n7. Einstein proposing his theories of relativity at 26 and 37\n8. Lee and Yang proposing their law at 30 and 34\n\nThese specific examples are used to support the proposition that many important scientific discoveries and inventions were made by scientists during their prime years when their thinking was most agile. The passage then extends this argument to social scientists and politicians as well.\n\nBy providing these numerous, concrete examples, the passage employs the E+ Method to argue for the truth of its proposition about the relationship between age and scientific achievement."}

The original statement is \"If x is a positive even number, then x is a natural number.\" The fallacious reasoning then swaps the condition and conclusion, erroneously believing that \"if x is a natural number, then x is a positive even number.\"\n\nThis perfectly fits the description of the CondSwap Method: \"If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\" In this case:\nP: x is a positive even number\nQ: x is a natural number\n\nThe fallacy occurs when it's assumed that because Q follows from P, P must also follow from Q, which is not necessarily true. Not all natural numbers are positive even numbers (e.g., odd numbers and zero are also natural numbers), even though all positive even numbers are natural numbers."}
