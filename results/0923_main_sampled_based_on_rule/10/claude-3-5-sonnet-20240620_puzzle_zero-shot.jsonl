Let's work through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to consider which operations will help us reach 24 using these numbers.\n\n2. One approach is to use multiplication to get close to 24, then adjust with addition or subtraction.\n\n3. We can start by multiplying 6 and 5, which gives us 30. This is close to 24.\n\n4. We need to subtract 6 from 30 to get 24. We can achieve this by using the remaining numbers 1 and 7.\n\n5. If we subtract 1 from 7, we get 6.\n\n6. So, our expression can be: (6 × 5) - (7 - 1)\n\n7. Let's verify: (6 × 5) - (7 - 1) = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once, uses only the allowed operations, and results in 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[6 × 5 - (7 - 1)]]"}
