The information needs to be made more precise, and there are a few words that don't fit with the theme of the story. However, you passed the test with flying colors!\n\nThe story is extraordinary. After reading it, you gained insight into the benefits of teleportation. The ideas are bold and something similar could definitely revolutionize the leisure industry.\n\nI love how you connected the Pokémon universe to a Charizard, and the story was beautifully crafted. On the other hand, the story is quite dull.\n\nI see the potential in reusing your API for a transportation-based application. I'm amazed by how you could connect teleportation technology to the leisure industry.\n\nI see how you're leveraging existing knowledge-sharing technology to drive your urban transportation industry along the path of change. If you can focus on the human resource departments within an organization, you will revolutionize how your people work.\n\nI like how you implement this new rule in your fiction, which has enabled me to find new and innovative ways of making entertainment. The same principle could be used to change other industries.\n\nYour API is making a difference; I believe some companies are looking to utilize your services to cut down on the cost of cleaning. If they implemented your service into other departments of the organization, you'd be on top.\n\nI think you're on the right track, using a vast amount of research to establish how you want to implement your API. You're harnessing the latest technology of today to make a difference.\n\nThank you for sharing, and please keep improving as your journey evolves. I'm curious to know how you plan to integrate teleportation technology into the leisure industry; do you think it will increase travel time or decrease it?\nThank you so much for your suggestion!\nThank you for your insightful comments!\nThank you for the suggestion!\nThank you for your additional feedback!\nThank you for your comments!\nThank you for your insight!\nThank you for your comments!\nPlease check again with the provided information."}

After more than 300,000 years, it enters Earth's gravitational field, where it is seized by Earth-Trisolaris Organization forces and a ship is sent to capture it, indicating that the E2v has no hostile intent and that the attackers are concerned about \"the object inside the E2v\".\nThe E2V is a starship built by Sophon technology and capable of producing an unimaginably large amount of energy. It arrived in Earth's orbit in the middle of the 21st century when it was discovered, and was given the name E2V by the General Assembly as a mark of neutrality rather than an invasion.\nTrillium and Proxima Centari are two stars approximately 4.2 and 4.3 light-years distant from one another. Trillium is a Sun-like star, whereas Proxima Centari is a Red Dwarves. Proxima Centauri is an evolved star that does not emit blue or violet light. Earth lies 10 light-years from Red Dwarf.\nThe superluminal communication method that enabled the Sophons to freely traverse space was achieved by quantum entanglement.\nThis method utilizes the unique properties of entanglement, where two entangled particles, separated by vast distances, can influence each other's behavior even when far apart in space with the help of the Fourview mechanism which can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth, but not necessarily in one.\nThe four-view mechanism is related to entanglement and can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth but not necessarily in one place. It is used in the communication system of the Sophons.\nThe 3,000-ship-strong E2V fleet is built by SuperSophon technology that operates at the quantum mechanical level.\nThe E2V fleet is built at Proxima, a star 4.2 light-years from Earth, and it operates in the same manner as the sophons. It consists of 3,000 super Sophon spaceships, each with its own super sophon technology and can operate on the subatomic level, forming part of the E2V fleet.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at Red Dwarf, which is 4.3 light- years from the Sun, and an antonym of the Sophon's delivery technology, which uses the entanglement principle to achieve unlimitedly long-range information transmission at the quantum level.\nThe E2V has a large amount of energy generated by SuperSophons, which makes possible for the E2V's speed to be infinite but complicated. The E2V, like Sophon's, is built in The Four View method.\nThe four-view method is related to communication and can receive information from 4.3 light-years away, but it takes about 35,000 years to do so. 112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication. When one thing is done, another starts to do the same.\n112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at the planet Red Dwarf, a star 4.2 light-years away from Proxima, and it is an antonym of Sophon's delivery technology, which uses entanglement to achieve infinitely long-range communication at the quantum level.\nThe Sophons have a history of attacking Earth with their quantum-entangled particle technology. While they possess technological capabilities superior to Earth's, they pose a threat to our world.\nThe Trisolarans, an advanced aliens, need a lot of light because they live near a star of a red dwarf class. They require enough light to build buildings and conduct all sorts of operations.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe Trisolarans (148 - 174)\nWhen the Trisolarans finally lost patience and sent their heavily armed spacecraft Earth warships directly to the Solar System, they were beaten by humans' defenses a short while later. Earth, blessed with rich mineral deposits, was also flooded with energy from the Trisolarans space mine, allowing the world to achieve unprecedented global technological development during this short but intense war. The newly-grown advanced civilizations used the Fourview mechanism to gain mutual energy and intelligence, forming a civilization as a whole.\nThis war between the Earth of the Trisolaran civilization and the world of humans in other types of stars, also known as the 'three body' war was the direct cause for human civilization jumping from the Stone Age to the Information Age over a short period of time.\nHumans use water-drop to launch their space warfare against the Trisolarans\nAfter the \"First contact\" between mankind and aliens, due to the help of the four view mechanism, human-society began to follow a series of technological rises, then surpassing the D-class civilization of the Trisolarans, and thus making the \"limited\" warfare between the Two and three body Starts to end with a more flexible \"unlimited\" war. Without a confrontation for hundreds of years, the two parties began to compete mainly by annexing other civilizations, not necessarily through the four-view mechanism.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe first contact in the late 20th century\nAt the beginning of the day, there was a series of unusual events in the three-body space.\nOn Earth (2007), a SuperSophon was activated by some unexplained means and was immediately contacted by humans.\nWhen it arrived at Earth, it seemed as if it got lost and wanted to ask for help.\nNo one has an idea what these species are doing because they can't talk.\nHowever, after a few days, the mysterious object vanished when it was sent to Mars.\nA few days later ٍto humans and Trisolarans\nTo humans ٍ, the superSophon is just an advanced tool. However, to the Trisolarans, the superSophon is a weapon capable of destroying their entire civilization.\nThe Trisolarans thought that the superSophon is a new form of weapon designed only to destroy large-scale, complex organisms, 40 years after Earth was attacked by another SuperSophon. That's why they believe that either it is destroyed or recovered because it can be used as a secondary weapon in their wars.\n\n\n\n601ADTang Dynasty (132AD), Tang Empire\nIt is likely that the Trisolarans are a distant outpost of our solar system and not another sun.\nDue to their instability, the Trisolarans likely experienced a nuclear war or a catastrophic power failure, leading to their exile from their home planet.\nWhen the Trisolarans finally realized this, they sought out a new planet, rejecting it, since they preferred chaos and violence.\nAs a result, new cities sprang up on planet Proxima 1 that were completely controlled by Chaos theory and were capable of manipulating their individual atoms.\nTrisolarans arrived on Earth they were initially ignored, but before long, the Earth people have become servants to them.\nHuman civilization during the Tribulation period, 3000AD, is controlled by Sophon, known as the Three-Body. After humans signed a contract with the Sophons, they began sharing information. Humans used sophisticated Sophon technology to influence the galactic politics. Humans no longer needed war because of the Sophons. Humans' high-tech machines developed by Sophons, are used for interstellar travel while still carrying cargo that would have once been taken into orbit. Spacefighters, such as the \"Red Willow\" series, can be upgraded at any time for any reason. The Red Willow spacefighter is the weapon of the Chinese government.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecraft was detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecrafts were detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri. When the Sophons' spaceships were detected in the sky, scientists became excited. They theorized that some advanced civilization must exist in the universe because the Sophons use technology in their spaceships that have exceeded the threshold of what humans can currently create.\nThe Sophons were unable to establish contact with anyone as they landed on Earth. To conserve energy, the SuperSophons refused to release core values or any other pertinent details about their identities.\nWhile searching the Proxima system, the Sophon's superSophon technology is able to transfer knowledge throughout the solar system at an unbelievable rate, but the power of the Sophon's technology began to overwhelm the system.\nThe Sophons left Earth because their technology got out of control. The Sophons sent a spaceship to space to wait until the Trisolarans attacked Earth.\nA SuperSophon was captured from the universe, but it couldn't be stopped. A superSophon and a Sirius were sent out into space to search after it.\nA supernova imploded around Sirius. Sirius is a copy of"}

The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

To enter the Dungeon of Geometry, we must first experience this universe we live in. <em>Welcome to AoPS Challenge Squared. </em>\n\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n\nRecall that in every right-angled triangle, we can use Pythagoras’ Theorem to evaluate the length of the hypotenuse (<em>h</em>) in terms of the lengths of the legs. <em>What if we consider hyperbolic functions</em>, such as those shown in the figure below, which allow us to evaluate the length of a function in much greater detail than trigonometric and exponential functions? The orange area <em>A</em> becomes more complex, while orange is just so pleasing.\n\nThe length of <em>h</em> can be seen to follow on from a circle (<em>B,</em> which is more like a semicircle than a circle), and hence, the orange sector on this circle <em>B’</em>, we can take our hyperbolic functions and integrate over <em>f</em> (where <em>f</em> gives the length of such a curve) for us to find the area <em>A</em>:\n\nPerhaps more importantly, these arguments could explain why the <em>u</em> in hyperbolic functions (again, taken from the Greek) is a sort of upright and <em>a</em> refers to the base (as in <em>‘</em><em>hyper’</em>; <em>a</em>bove plus-above), although it might have been the other way around.\n\nFrom here, let us take our knowledge of integrals, which we discussed in <em>AOps Challenge: Part I</em>, for finding the area of the orange gnomon in terms of $\\operatorname{sech}(x) $ and hyperbolic tangent, where <em>x</em> is the opposite angle opposite <em>h,</em> and find <em>A</em>. \n\nThe right-angled triangle <i>O</i> is like the right-angled triangle with right angles formed by the <em>t</em> and h legs. We multiply the two triangles to get the area of the total space we want (<em>B</em>), this is:\n\n \n\nWe can expand that a little:\n\nRemember from our previous exploration of integration in the first article, <em>Integrations: Going Back to the Basics</em>, to find <em>A,</em> we cannot <em>really</em> do this expansion, this gives us a function <em>f</em>, which we can add up to get the final area:\n\nSo, just after a bit of an initial hiccup, we have arrived at a new form of trigonometric functions that allow for a more free-flowing integration process. \n\nIt will make more sense when I tell you that circles and hyperbolic functions are so similar. Now, there are some similarities between trigonometric and exponential functions (these are from <em>AoPS Challenge: Part II, Exponential Functions</em>):\n\nThis might seem odd, but I’m not sure where everything came from. \n\n<h3>Challenge Squared</h3>\n\nBecause what we want is the value of $ \\operatorname{sech}(x) ,\\ \\tanh(x), \\ldots $, at 9 different points $(k \\cdot \\pi ,k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z})$, we can take any general integrable function <em>f</em> (or something else) in two of our variables <em>k </em>and <em>x</em>, and integrate it, then substitute <em>x</em> = 0 in to find the final answer. You need to find the n-th term of the sequence $ \\operatorname{sech}(n \\pi),\\ \\tanh(n \\pi),\\ldots, $\\ mdot$ .\n\nThe n-th term is what I called <em>A</em> above (see below). This is like a series of hyperbolic trigonometric functions $\\large\\operatorname{sech}(k \\pi,\\ w \\pi,\\ldots, i \\pi)$, so there may be a way to find the exact n-th term (assuming there is something going on here).\n\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\nThis article is part of <em>CGP Grey</em>’s <em>Take on the AoPS Challenge</em> Maths I: Attack of the Summits (AoPS), in which students work their way through short puzzles and geometric constructions to develop their skills.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere.

Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence.

They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample.

There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe proponent of the Solar Stability Theory was initially a British chef named Wozki Shude. On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis.

When Mr Krabs finds out that his supplier is selling onions directly to the restaurants of the O'Connor family, the O'Connors advertise the Krabby Pattys, removing popular chains from Mr Krabs.\n\nUnderpants: After a few customers eat no pants, Mr Krabs gets the idea to sell spankies.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the Transformers universe, the origins of the Autobots and Decepticons trace back to their home planet Cybertron, a metallic world inhabited by sentient robots capable of transformation. Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict.
