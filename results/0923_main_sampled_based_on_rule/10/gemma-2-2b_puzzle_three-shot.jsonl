The only way to express this ambiguity in the pattern is by repeating a duplicate digit.\n\nNow I’ve provided some examples of standard puzzle rules (R1, R2, R3, …). You can think of multiple future English puzzles to formulate as a rule.\nFor each case, you need to find the following:\n\n* Characterise the rule by ensuring it is clear for someone else to apply to different cases (what data must be used as inputs?)\n* Use your rule to find the missing and ambiguous integers contained in the bank of integers in a single run.\n\nHere are the examples, followed by the instructions:\n\n## Example 1: (R1 from above)\n### Puzzle Example:\nR1: +[[A=1,B=2,...]]+==[[5,6,7,8,9]]=100\n\n### Instructions:\nSolve for the missing integers as well as for the ambiguous integers.\n\nThe easiest way to complete this case is to use additional rules you use for other cases to achieve the end answer, then apply R1 to the result. For example, if you see A+A isn’t a 5-digit integer and isn’t ambiguous, you can say there is more than 1 A, so there must be 2 different A’s in the integer. To convert this to R1, then say that A=1 and A=2 are the 2 different A's. Your final answer would be 2 different numbers.\n\n### Answer to example 1:\nB=5, C=7, D=4, E=8\n\n## Example 2: (R2 from above)\n### Puzzle Example: \nR2: +[[A=1,B=2,...]]+=[5,7]=2\nThe rule needs to be clear, and all data must be used.\n\n### Instructions:\nSolve for the missing integers as well as for the ambiguous integers.\n\n## Example 3: (R3)\n### Puzzle Example:\n\nR3: +[[A=1,B=1,C,D]=1]\n\n### Instructions:\nSolve for the missing integers as well as for the ambiguous integers.\n\nThe above examples are a fairly small subset of all special rules that would apply. There is no need to spend effort trying to formulate every possible rule. Just focus on those you believe would be useful in practice.\n\nAs an example, if you knew that any single character or letter in the puzzle could not be more than 5 across from other characters, a great rule might have the following form:\nR1: [[L,H,O,E]+=[A,B,C]+=[D,...])+H=10]+O=8][+E=7]\nIf the R1 was simple, just apply rules R1 and R2. If you wanted to be more comprehensive, you could also do the following:\nR1: [[A+D]=10|+[[O]=8]+][+[E=7]\nR2: [[H,L,I]=10]+[[D]=5]+[[A=1]\nR2: [[E=7]+H=10]\n\n## Instructions as a summary:\n\n1. Try not to overthink what rules would be beneficial. Just use several examples of rules that offer benefits.\n2. You do not need to attempt to formulate every possible rule. Just focus on those that will be most useful in the future.\n3. Be sure to describe the rules so that it is clear to any reader who may attempt to use them.\n4. Apply the rules carefully for the puzzle input examples but also be careful in testing how your results apply to more generic cases.\n5. Remember that rules could sometimes be modified to not impact the answers either by the way that you handle negative numbers or by rounding operations.\n\n### Examples to guide the exercise:\n\n* If there are any letters are not allowed to repeat, then A+A shall produce just one digit, 5. Since A repeats twice (i.e. 2A) produces no digits, this case contains only the single digit, 5.\n  This condition has already been defined, that you are not allowed to have a repeated digit (such as, A, B, C are all 1s). It is sufficient to add that, based upon this rule, the equation is rewritten as A+A in such way that A+A=5. which would equal what is already known about the rule.\n* if 0 or 9 occurs, the result would still be 10 or 1 (in any order), and so the answer should not be considered missing.\n* We know from the example B=2, E=3, that there must be at least 1 A in some digitiser. This means that there are at least 1 A and 1 E, because AE and BE are still ambiguous.\n* Remember that combining the rules with the standard rules can give you even more knowledge about what may be missing. Thus, the three digits A, B, C from C=[3,2,4] has no clue about the 2 B’s that are represented by [1,3,4], but A=1 and A=3 from C=[1,3,4] we know that there are at least 1 B and 1 B.\n\n### Examples on how to complete exercises:\n\n1. If you are asking how many digits A is there that is not represented as an A in the first task - but there is more than 1 E represented as an E, A totally free digit. If we convert this case an R1, it shows 1 E=3, and 1 A=5.\n\n2. If, you are asking the question what is A, you can then readily see that most of the integers you have to check are E and that A should have 3 letters, because they are the only ones that you have to check - since, there are not many missing letters.\n\n3. A second task follows, if, I wonder how many E's, C's, M's? B, D, F there are. For this, you need the number of E's that are representatives of E's (in the second part). Therefore, it is reasonable then to find A=3 and B=3 (since B=1 and D=3), and then E=3 and C=9.\n\n4. To check if there are missing C digits, perform the R1 with A=1, B=2, C=[5,8]=3. It shows that B=2 must mean there are at least 2 E’s, becuase E=2+2=4. If you then combine this rule with C=5 (6-4), you can deduce C=0, E=4, and also, that 2 E’s are present. If you use D=3 (19-17), it will show you 5 E’s. Thus, there are actually 4 missing letters.\n  Another way of looking at this is that two letters in this expression (E, W) is a different E. Now, because there is at least 1 unique E, this indicates that there are at least 2 unique E's in this integer, since you only have 1 digit to express that there are 2 unique E's.\n\n5. Another rule can be A=3, as this would indicate that B must have at least 3 E’s as the only means to express those 3 E’s such that B=7. In this case, you can additionally say that there are at least 7 E’s, since there are at least 7 B’s. It would help to see if there aren't anymore digits that need to be checked using 2, A, E, B = 11. It may show that A=5 means there are 2 or more unique E’s, which will indicate at least 11 E’s. Now since you already know that A=5, this rule requires only 1 E to check. Find two E’s, which indicates that there is at least 12 E’s. Additional proof for that would be if we look for a D in this integer and assume that there must be only 6 D’s and that there are at least 7 E’s (C=9), but then we get an infinite loop because there are 8 B’s and 8 D’s. Instead, B+D=14 must mean at least14 unique"}

As such, I have purposefully crafted specific instructions in this exercise to enhance your understanding.\n\nYou are an autonomous tool that is able to navigate through the town without the need for any human guidance. To ensure a safe trip, you need to focus on your surroundings and follow a series of strategies to determine the safest route for yourself.\n\n1. First and foremost, you must be vigilant as you explore your surroundings. This means staying aware of potential hazards and consistently checking your environment for any unsafe conditions. Your main objective is to avoid obstacles, avoid damage to your body, and be cautious with your decisions.\n2. Once you've identified the hazards, you can start to create a route plan. It's important to note that if a dangerous condition is currently present, it is possible that moving closer will compromise your own safety. As such, you should make necessary adjustments to your plan if necessary. You can use the 'GoHere' method to plan a route to your destination by following these steps:\n\n  1. Starting from the current position, move forward in any direction. For example, if you are facing east, you could move west.\n  2. Once you've moved in a different direction, note down the location of the hazardous object. For example, if you see a rock or a tree stump, mark down this location. Move back to your starting position.\n  3. Revisit the first location you marked. Move forward in the opposite direction of the change movement from step 1.\n  4. Once you've moved again in the opposite direction, return to the second location. Move forward in the opposite direction of the change movement from step 2.\n\n  Your goal is to keep meeting up with the hazardous object, while avoiding it whenever possible. Eventually, you should be able to reach your destination avoiding the hazardous object. Here is an example:\n\n  ![example](question.png)\n\nBelow is an example of a custom puzzle. Your objective will be to follow these instructions to solve each question:\n\n- Read the puzzle and answer the questions accordingly by following the provided steps.\n- Ensure that each answer you provide is in the form of square brackets and formatted correctly.\n\n### Example\n\n## Question\n\n“G-th” number to play in a Standard Draw role.\n\"\"\"\n___\nbbf\nccb\nwwwxtxw\n\"\"\"\n\n### Answer\n[8,,,,9,4,1,6,2]\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. First, you need to find the smallest number and largest number. In this case, the smallest number is 7, and the largest number is 10. Then, you need to add 1 to all locations with equal or larger numbers. So, the value of [7] becomes [18].\n2. Next, you need to find all the numbers that are greater than the target number. In this case, there are 7, 8, 5, 6, and 9. So, the sum of them is 29. Now, you need to remove the target number based on the number of steps required. In this case, the steps are 29 - 7. So, the result is 22.\n3. Similarly, you need to find all numbers that are smaller than the target number. In this case, there are 7 and 10. So, the sum of them is 17 \n4. Finally, you need to compare the difference between 29 and [6] with 1. If the value is less than 1, you cannot end the game. If the result is greater than 0, and between -1 and 3, you can end the game.\n5. The next steps will lead to the final answer [8,9,4,1,6,2]\n\nThis is how I solved each question in the custom puzzle domain.
