When questions involve both positive and negative values, do not forget to provide both, and remember to enclose them in double square brackets.\n\n### Question 2:\nTo find the negative x where x^2=81, consider the following: Take the square root of x^2 to obtain a positive number y. Assuming X is a variable with a value of 1, such an equation means X equals Y. However, since we're taking the square of a positive number, it's also equal to negative Y.\n\nTo answer this question, consider the relationship between positive Y and negative Y.\n\nWe can find such a value of X that, once X and Y are equal, their squares are equal. Even if X and Y are negative, this relation still holds. Now, we can simplify the equation X^2 by finding its square root, obtaining Y^2.\n\nRemember, we're looking for the positive root of X to get Y. Therefore, we can express our answer with a double square bracket following this rule: [[1_x]]\n\nThen, we must find the value(s) of x.\n\nHint: Begin by taking the square root of 81.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets: [[your answer]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-9]]\n\n### Question:\nFor a given X where X^2=1, using the rule X=X^1, what's its value?\nThe correct answer should be two positive and negative values.\nFor example: [[1_-1]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nSolve: 35^(36)=0.9\n\n### Question 2:\nAnswer: [[your answer]]\n\n### Hint: When X^(35)=0.9, don't forget to go through a series of calculations until you get a value equal to 36.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_0.1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nEvaluate the equation 4+(9 * 30) = ?.\n\nBefore providing the answer, start by breaking down the steps and writing them neatly, please!\n\nFor instance:\n4 + (9 * 30) = 4 + 270\n\n\n### Question 2:\nPlease also find the value that equals to ?.\nThe answer is a number. please wrap it in double square brackets, like [[your answer]]\n\nHint: The final solution for the example is 282\n\n### Answer:\n[[282]]"}
