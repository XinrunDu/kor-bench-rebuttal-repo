In the above question, you can see that in the following 8 cells, there is a number 3, from which there are two possibilities of mines, either two will be mines or three will be mines.\n2. The question also says that in a cell with a number 3, two of the cells should be mines. Therefore 1, 2, or 3 can be a mine.\n2. If you do the rest of the calculations like this then you can easily solve any custom puzzle.\n\n### Examples:\n\nIn the first example, the answer should be 'A X A' indicating that number 3 is the number of mines, and number 4 is the number of mines, respectively.\nIn the second example, the answer should be 'A X X' indicating that number 1 is the number of mines, and number 3 is the number of mines, respectively.\nIn the third example, the answer should be 'A A X A' indicating that number 1 is the number of mines, and number 3 is the number of mines, respectively.\n## Function Description:\n\n1.You can solve this puzzle recursively.\n2.It may take a long time to finish, so try to be fast.\n3.Recursive recursion is always possible although not in this specific rule but in other cases while solving other puzzles because you will not know it before.\n4.The type of the questions you have been asked may contain different puzzle types, but as one you can solve similar puzzles in the beginning.\n\nYou provided the questions, and I will provide the answers for you to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPuzzle Rule:\n1. In this puzzle, some of the cells contain either mines or numbers (other than mines), and some cells contain no mines.\n2. There are two types of mines in this puzzle: land mines and air mines. Land mines can be placed on any non-zero square in the puzzle (including squares that contains mines). Air mines can be placed on any square in the puzzle (including non-zero squares).\n3. The number of mines in a square is the number of mines in all other squares in the same row and in the same column.\n4. The number of air mines is the number of air mines in all remaining squares.\n5. The sum of mines and the number of air mines is the number of mines in this puzzle.\n\nExample Input:\n9 X 3 2 X\n2 9 X 2 2\n8 7 X 6 8\n2 7 7 6 9\n9 X 3 2 X\n\nThe puzzle's solution:\nAfter completing the puzzle, here are the results: It's a land mine, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 6, 8.\n\n### Problem Solution:\nIn the early stages, it is the case of **recursion**, \n<br/>that is, one problem is solved and the solution is taken as another problem and that solution is taken and the solution is taken.\n\n1.

By solving the traditional maze, most people start from the starting point and will of course use the traditional 'backtracking algorithm' to locate the goal, but what if we have a more intelligent method to solve the puzzle?\n\n*In fact, the use of intelligence and wisdom is equivalent to rewriting a rule similar to the rules of life. The key is to master the correct use of this wisdom or intelligence, that is, to rewrite the program.\n\n*While playing this game, what we can do is to give reasonable guidance and direction to the player at any time, so that once he encounters a situation, he will not be confused. These reasonable prompts are often called 'inflection points'. In essence, these inflection points are based on a powerful AI rule, and this shell-like calculation rule includes several principles:\n\n1. Every cell in a grid corresponds to an accurate arrow.\n2. There is no possibility for a circular reference. The grid is not in a cyclical arrangement.\n3. There is no possibility to choose a new path after moving to a certain grid, and can only follow the direction indicated by the arrow.\n4. The AI has absolute confidence that it is able to reach the goal smoothly.\n\n*Of course, this traditional maze only requires these four principles, and the corresponding game rules are not difficult. If you have ever heard of 'Life Rules', you may remember that the starting condition is an empty table with different points of life sprinkled on it. These points of life are simply arranged randomly according to AI's confidence in the future. The goal of 'Life Rules 2048' is to rule out these rules of life like a puzzle to maximize the use of intelligence or wisdom to create an intelligent assistant who can effectively solve the puzzle.*\n\n### Instructions:\n\n*In the program, you are required to design a program that can calculate the inflection point. The calculation process can use dynamic programming methods, and when there are errors, we will send a corresponding rule to guide you to solve the problem.*\n\n### Output Example:\n\nOutput in the form of a function, the function named ```solve```, input the shape of the maze ```board```, and output a list corresponding to the positions of the inflection points as well as the result of the inference."}
