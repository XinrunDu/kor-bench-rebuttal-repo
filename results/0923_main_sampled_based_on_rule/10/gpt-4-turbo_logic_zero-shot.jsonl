Also, there are a total of 8 possible terms of three variables, and we have only covered 5 terms.\n\nGiven that the PDNF should include all possible paired conjunctive terms for the formula to be a tautology and it doesn't in this case, the given formula does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nSince the terms included are explicit in their use of alternating true assignments (binary) and represent a true outcome negated to form a simple conjunctive term, we can safely conclude:\n[[B]]"}

If L = p, then L\u2019 = \u00acp; if L = \u00acp, then L\u2019 = p.\n\nResolution: Suppose simple disjunctive clause C1 = C3 \u2228 L, C2 = C4 \u2228 L\u2019, then C1 and C2 can be resolved, and it is defined that dispel(C1, C2) = C3 \u2228 C4. If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nResolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment are as follows:\n1. Input: Conjunctive normal form S.\n2. Output: If S has a satisfying assignment, output \u201cPlausible\u201d; otherwise, output \u201cImplausible\u201d.\n3. Steps:\n    1. Initialization:\n        - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n        - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in S.\n    2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n        - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output \u201cImplausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n        - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output \u201cImplausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    4. Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output \u201cPlausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nFor p\u2227(p\u2228q)\u2227(p\u2228\u00acq)\u2227(q\u2228\u00acr)\u2227(q\u2228r), \nwhat are S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm?\nProvide the answers in the format [[];[];[]],\nwhere sets are represented using {}, \nand an empty set is denoted by \u2205.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the conjunctive normal form S = p \u2227 (p \u2228 q) \u2227 (p \u2228 \u00acq) \u2227 (q \u2228 \u00acr) \u2227 (q \u2228 r), let's convert this into sets of clauses and apply the resolution algorithm processes to identify S0, S1, and S2 states before the second cycle.\n\nStart by decomposing S into clauses:\n- S contains the clauses {p}, {p \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 \u00acq}, {q \u2228 \u00acr}, {q \u2228 r}.\n\n#### Initialization:\n- Initial S0 = \u2205.\n- All simple disjunctive clauses initially are in S1 = {{p}, {p \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 \u00acq}, {q \u2228 \u00acr}, {q \u2228 r}}.\n- Initial S2 = \u2205.\n\n#### Resolution in S0 and S1:\n- Since S0 is empty in the first cycle, no resolution occurs between the clauses in S0 and S1.\n\n#### Resolution in S1:\n- We are looking for pairs of clauses (C1, C2) that can be resolved:\n  1.

Thus, S2 remains empty as all resolutions lead to clauses already present or empty clauses.\n\n#### Check S2:\n- Since S2 contains no elements, S1 doesn't change, no clauses move to S0, and S2 remains empty for the next cycle.\n\n### Before the second cycle:\n- S0 = \u2205\n- S1 = {{p}, {p \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 \u00acq}, {q \u2228 \u00acr}, {q \u2228 r}}\n- S2 = \u2205\n\nThe notation according to the specified format:\n[\u2205;{{p}, {p \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 \u00acq}, {q \u2228 \u00acr}, {q \u2228 r}};\u2205]"}

Referring to the logic rule:\n- \u00b6p and \u00a7\u00acp; \u203dp and \u00a7p have a * relationship (both cannot be true and cannot be false, which does not fit here as per our analysis).\n- \u00b6p and \u203dp have a x relationship (both cannot be true but can both be false, which also does not align as we are dealing with permissions only).\n- \u00a7p and \u00a7\u00acp have an @ relationship (both cannot be false, but can both be true, which aligns since if \u00a7\u00acp is true, an absence of \u00a7p would make it true as well).\n- \u00b6p and \u00a7p; \u203dp and \u00a7\u00acp have a % relationship (both can be true, and both can be false).\n\nEvaluating these relationships: \n- The @ relationship, which is valid for \u00a7p and \u00a7\u00acp, indicates both cannot be false but can be true, aligning closely with \u00ac\u00a7p \u2192 \u00a7\u00acp. Here, if we agree that p is not permitted (\u00ac\u00a7p), it directly permits \u00acp (\u00a7\u00acp), making sure one of them (either p or \u00acp) should always hold a permission.\n\nFormula (7) \u00ac\u00a7p \u2192 \u00a7\u00acp corresponds clearly to the @ relationship where both cannot be false, but can both be true.\n\nThe answer is thus [[C]]."}

I will keep on painting.\n\nGiven the statement \"I will always keep on painting,\" it aligns with the symbol Gp (future period of time proposing a continuing action: painting). According to Reasoning Equation 21 (Gp \u2192 Fp), it implies that Gp (I will always keep on painting) leads to Fp (I will keep on painting at a future point in time). \n\nTherefore, the correct deduction from the statement, based on using Reasoning Equation 21, is D.

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nThe baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up. \u2192 The mother is the baby's mother.
