Based on the constraints provided at the top and bottom of the grid and on the left and right, here's how we can solve it step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the clues:\n   - Top: 2, 3, 2, 1\n   - Bottom: 2, 2, 1, 3\n   - Left: 3, 1, 2, 2\n   - Right: 1, 3, 2, 2\n\n2. Fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 4 ensuring no repeats in any row or column, and satisfying the visibility conditions from the outside clues.\n\n3. Start with the highest constraint numbers because they provide more direct guidance:\n   - A \"4\" clue would mean the skyscrapers must be in descending order because each must be visible.\n   - A \"1\" clue signifies only the tallest skyscraper can be visible.\n\n4. Using these constraints, solve the grid while maintaining the rules:\n\nThe final solved grid is:\n```\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 2 3\n1 3 3 4\n2 4 1 2\n```\n\nFormatting the solution as per instructions:\n\n[[3 2 4 1, 4 1 2 3, 1 3 3 4, 2 4 1 2]]"}
