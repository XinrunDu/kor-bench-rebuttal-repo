Subtract these complex numbers:\n\n   \\( (3 + Yi) − (2 + 1i) = (3 - 2) + (Y - 1)i \\)\n   Simplifying:\n   \\( 1 + (Y - 1)i \\)\n\n5. Set this equal to the given complex number \\( 1 + 3i \\):\n\n   \\( 1 + (Y - 1)i = 1 + 3i \\)\n\n6. Equate the imaginary parts only (since the real parts are already equal):\n   \n   \\( Y - 1 = 3 \\)\n\n7. Solve for \\( Y \\):\n\n   \\( Y = 3 + 1 \\)\n   \\( Y = 4 \\)\n\nThus, the value of \\( Y \\) is \\( 4 \\).\n\n### Answer:\n[[4]]"}
