Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Weights**:\n   - Each black cell in column i has a weight equal to its row position (1 through n).\n   - Each black cell in row j has a weight equal to its column position (1 through n).\n\n2. **Sum Constraints**:\n   - The sum of weights for each column is given at the bottom (3, 9, 4, 6).\n   - The sum of weights for each row is given on the right (5, 7, 6, 5).\n\n3. **Construct the Grid**:\n   - We will place 1s in the grid cells to satisfy the sum constraints for each row and column.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the rows and columns:\n\n### Column Constraints:\n- Column 1: Sum = 3\n- Column 2: Sum = 9\n- Column 3: Sum = 4\n- Column 4: Sum = 6\n\n### Row Constraints:\n- Row 1: Sum = 5\n- Row 2: Sum = 7\n- Row 3: Sum = 6\n- Row 4: Sum = 5\n\n### Placement Strategy:\n- We need to ensure that the sum of the weights in each row and column matches the given constraints.\n- Start by looking for the largest sums first to simplify the process.\n\n### Solution:\n1. **Column 2 (Sum = 9)**:\n   - The only way to get 9 is by having black cells in positions 2, 3, and 4 (2 + 3 + 4 = 9).\n   - So, place 1s in positions (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4).\n\n2. **Row 2 (Sum = 7)**:\n   - Since we already have 1s in positions (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4), this row is already satisfied.\n\n3. **Column 4 (Sum = 6)**:\n   - The only way to get 6 is by having black cells in positions 2 and 4 (2 + 4 = 6).\n   - So, place 1s in positions (2,4) and (4,4).\n\n4. **Row 4 (Sum = 5)**:\n   - Place a 1 in position (4,1) to get a weight of 3 (since row 4 position 1).\n   - Place a 1 in position (4,4) to get a weight of 2 (since row 4 position 4).\n   - Total weight in row 4 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n5. **Column 1 (Sum = 3)**:\n   - Place a 1 in position (4,1) to get a weight of 3 (since column 1 position 4).\n\n6. **Row 1 and Column 3**:\n   - Adjust the remaining positions to satisfy the remaining constraints.\n\nAfter placing the 1s according to the constraints, the final grid is:\n\n```\nX  1  X  X  5\nX  1  1  1  7\nX  X  1  X  6\n1  X  X  1  5\n3  9  4  6  \n```\n\nHowever, the above might not be perfectly accurate, so let's recheck and adjust if necessary.\n\n### Final Grid (Re-checked):\n```\nX  1  X  1  5\nX  1  1  1  7\nX  X  1  X  6\n1  X  X  1  5\n3  9  4  6  \n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[X 1 X 1, X 1 1 1, X X 1 X, 1 X X 1]]"}

Each cell in the grid must contain a number from 1 to 4, and each number must appear only once in each row and column.\n\n2. **Regions and Operations**:\n   - (1,1)(2,1):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (1,1) and (2,1) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (3,3)(3,4):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (3,3) and (3,4) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (1,2)(1,3):1- → This means the numbers in cells (1,2) and (1,3) when subtracted, should equal 1.\n   - (1,4)(2,4):8* → This means the numbers in cells (1,4) and (2,4) when multiplied, should equal 8.\n   - (2,2)(2,3):3* → This means the numbers in cells (2,2) and (2,3) when multiplied, should equal 3.\n   - (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ → This means the sum of the numbers in cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2) should equal 13.\n   - (4,3)(4,4):2- → This means the numbers in cells (4,3) and (4,4) when subtracted, should equal 2.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start with the simplest constraints and fill in possible values, ensuring no number is repeated in rows or columns.\n   - Use trial and error or logical deduction to fill in the grid while satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Detailed Filling:\n- **(1,1)(2,1):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (1,1), then 4 must be in (2,1).\n- **(3,3)(3,4):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (3,3), then 4 must be in (3,4).\n- **(1,2)(1,3):1-**: Possible pairs (3,2) and (4,3). If we place 3 in (1,2), then 4 must be in (1,3).\n- **(1,4)(2,4):8***: Possible pairs (2,4) and (1,8). If we place 2 in (1,4), then 4 must be in (2,4).\n- **(2,2)(2,3):3***: Possible pairs (1,3) and (3,1). If we place 3 in (2,2), then 1 must be in (2,3).\n- **(3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+**: Possible combinations that sum to 13. Place 1, 3, 4, 5 in these cells (ensure no duplicates).\n- **(4,3)(4,4):2-**: Possible pairs (3,1) and (4,2). If we place 3 in (4,3), then 1 must be in (4,4).\n\nAfter filling in the grid based on these constraints, we get the following grid:\n\n```\n2 3 4 1\n4 1 3 2\n1 4 2 3\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[2 3 4 1,4 1 3 2,1 4 2 3,3 2 1 4]]"}

Now, considering (2,2) < (2,3), place 1 in (2,2) and 2 in (2,3):\n\n   2 X X 1  \n   X 1 2 2  \n   X X X X  \n   X X X X  \n\n4. For (3,2) > (4,2), place 3 in (3,2) and 1 in (4,2):\n\n   2 X X 1  \n   X 1 2 2  \n   X 3 X X  \n   X 1 X X  \n\n5. For (3,1) > (3,4) and (3,4) > (4,4), place 4 in (3,1), 3 in (3,4), and 2 in (4,4):\n\n   2 X X 1  \n   X 1 2 2  \n   4 3 X 3  \n   X 1 X 2  \n\n6. Fill in the remaining numbers ensuring no repetition in rows and columns:\n\n   2 4 3 1  \n   3 1 2 2  \n   4 3 1 3  \n   2 1 4 2  \n\nFinal grid:\n\n2 4 3 1  \n3 1 2 4  \n4 3 1 3  \n2 1 4 2  \n\n### Answer:\n[[2 4 3 1,3 1 2 4,4 3 1 3,2 1 4 2]]"}

Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question:\naross: LAD LADY\ndown:DAY LAY\nX\tX\tX\t0\tX\t0\n0\t0\t0\t0\tX\t0\n0\tX\tX\tX\tX\t0\n0\t0\t0\tX\t0\t0\n0\t0\t0\tX\t0\t0\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

The bottom constraint is 2, so the tallest must be second from the bottom. This leaves us with the middle cell in the first column being 5.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**:\n   - Using similar logic, we can place the remaining skyscrapers by ensuring each row and column has unique heights and meets the visibility constraints.\n\n4. **Final Grid**:\n   - After filling in all the heights, the grid should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\n  2   2   3   2   1\n2  4   5   2   1   3   1\n4  1   2   4   5   3   2\n2  5   4   3   2   1   2\n1  2   3   1   4   5   5\n2  3   1   5   3   2   3\n  2   3   1   2   3\n```\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.\n\n### Answer:\n`[[4 5 2 1 3, 1 2 4 5 3, 5 4 3 2 1, 2 3 1 4 5, 3 1 5 3 2]]`"}
