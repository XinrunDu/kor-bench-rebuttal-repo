Students receive a free slice of pizza if they sign up for a certain on-campus activity. If a student signs up for n activities, she(he) will receive n slices of pizza for free. Additionally, the school cafeteria has a very special way of pricing the pizzas. For each hundreds of the i-th(s) time the activity is signed up for, the thousandths digit is \"i\" + \"1\" = (i + 1). The ten-thousandths digit stays constant and is equal to 0. Just as an example, if Jenny signs up for that certain on-campus activity for the fifteenth time, then she will receive 15 slices of pizza for free, and the price of the pizza will be \\$15.16. Your friend Zoe has been storing all the activities she participates in an array in the form of {numberOfSlices: 0, price: 0}. As Zoe signs up for an additional activity, she will remove the elements of the old activity and add to the array a new element {numberOfSlices: (numberOfSlices + 1), price: (price + (uint(i) * 0.01)}  How will Zoe implement her algorithm to make sure that the array {numberOfSlices: 1, price: 1.00} is a valid element array and 1.0 >= zoeAssociation[numberOfSlices] >= 0.0  Implement your code snippet. The following code attempts to use a localStorage data object for a sample because the array is not built with ngimal. Be careful while using the localStorage data object. This will change the overall look and feel of your application. However, it can help you maintain scalability. var elemnet = {}; if(typeof(zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices) === \"undefined\") {  element.numberOfSlices = 0;  element.price = 1.00  } else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer - 1)' + i;  } localStorage.setItem(\"element1\", JSON.stringify(defaultPull));  Finally, in the ng-click event in your main controller, add the following code, which will execute the necessary functions. 1 modifyController($rootScope, $index, $scope, $translate, ngAlert, $myModal, $http, $window, $location, $sce, $parse, $loc, $anchorScroll) {  $scope.zoeFuture = function(zoeAssociation) {  var elemnet = {};  var array = [5,5,6,0];  var zoeAssociation = '2';  if(array) {  if(typeof(zoeAssociation.zoeFuture) === \"undefined\") {  }  else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer"}
