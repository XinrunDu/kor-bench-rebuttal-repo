Prefixes are commonly used to provide additional meaning to words, as in removing cancer (prefix \"re\") or bringing sunshine (prefix \"sun\"). In this case, the rule requires that a common prefix be added before these letter combinations to form meaningful words.\n\nSince one of the letter combinations is \"blem,\" the prefix \"def\" is inserted before it to form the word \"def vend, which means something close to healthy. This is a close match to one of the positive connotations of a 'common prefix' addition, and therefore it is selected as the answer."}

Your task is to write a Python program that can preprocess the unencrypted exam screenplay you get, so that you can decrypt it on an exam terminal. All exam terminals are designed to be quite fast, so decryption must be speedy. To get the specs of your terminal, use the function test_terminal().

On day one, you knit a fabric with a side length of one centimeter. Every day, you cheerfully enlarge the fabric by 50% of its side length. The 50% enlargement then becomes the new side length on day 2. After 20 days, the woolen fabric measures 255 cm, or you could say, 42 inches.\n\nCalculate the number of hours required to create this fabric.\n\nFull Title:    No Pain, No Gain\n\nOne-word answer:\n\nExtra points:    Emphatically true (Words to Ponder).   Extra points:    Emphatically false (Words to Ponder).\n\nExtra points:    True (Choose a title)\n\nExtra points:    False (Choose a title)\n\nExercise 2 Jump over the fence\n\nA man has built a fence around his house. Because he was kind of drunk when he did so, he placed the poles exactly a meter apart. Using 16 poles, he managed to cover the square two-dimensional part of the house. Before the sun rises, his son James has passed the night as a road worker and has constructed a wall. However, it turns out his wall can't meet the requirements of the laws about road maintenance, since the fences on the adjacent roads collide. The result of James's hard work has now become a third of a square meter.\n\n### Question:\n\nIn the morning, before the sun rises, we need to understand how the fence made by James will look like.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nStudy the problem described. Break down the task into subtasks. Use the appropriate tools and resources to solve the issue.\n\nIf needed, conduct research on any unknown concepts or terminology.\n\nUse awareness of the bigger picture to direct your approach in solving the issue.\n\nProvide a comprehensive solution in code. Testing and debugging may be required.\n\nDescription of the solution, including advanced considerations or trade-offs (if necessary).\n\n### Code:\n\nThe above code is run using the command \"g++ -w jump.cpp -o jump;\" followed by \"./jump\".\n\n### Answer:\n\ncode for the above task The output will be this image\n\nExercise 3 Minimum path\n\n# Game Theories\n\nGame Theory is the form of mathematics and the science that deals with strategic decision making. The focus is on optimal strategies to maximize the expected rewards in competitive circumstances or cooperative schemes.\n\nGame theory can make a prediction on what one will do in accordance with the anticipated output of the opponents. We identify these participants as players in the game in which the rewards or payoffs are attached to the strategy they follow. Knowledge about the expected goals of the other players and access to information about the strategy they are following is paramount when playing a game.\n\nGame Theory is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It is useful in numerous applications, such as in businesses and economics, sports, and the social sciences. It can also be used to analyze wars, politics, and other interplay activities. While there are many types of games, in game theory, they are classified into three categories  based on their payoff structure– Cooperative, Non-cooperative, and Dynamic.\n\n• Exercises Test\n• Logic Gates\n• Programming\n• Simplifying Boolean Expression\n• Grinder"}
