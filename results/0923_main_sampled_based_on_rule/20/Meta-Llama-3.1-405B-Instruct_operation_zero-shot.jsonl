Therefore, 104※13 = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate 19※28\n19 is not a multiple of 28, and 28 is not a multiple of 19. According to the rule, when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24. Therefore, 19※28 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate 24※4\nSince 24 is a multiple of 4 (24 = 6 * 4), we apply the rule a※b = a/b + 2. Therefore, 24※4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate 8※10\n8 is not a multiple of 10, but 10 is not a multiple of 8 either. However, we need to correct this step based on the proper evaluation of the previous operations: The correct sequence should continue from the result of 19※28, which was correctly identified as 24, and then the operation 24※4 was also correctly identified as 8. Then, we actually need to evaluate the full sequence correctly:\n\n- We've correctly determined 104※13 = 10.\n- Then, we need to evaluate 19※28 correctly as 24.\n- Next, the operation 24※4 was correctly identified as 8.\n- However, the mistake was in not following the given operation sequence correctly in the explanation: After correctly finding 19※28 = 24 and then 24※4 = 8, we need to apply the operation 8※10.\n\nGiven 8 is not a multiple of 10 and 10 is not a multiple of 8, according to the rule, 8※10 should indeed equal 24.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the Evaluation Sequence and Final Answer\nThe correct sequence should be:\n1. 104※13 = 10\n2. 19※28 = 24 (because they are not multiples of each other)\n3. 24※4 = 8 (correctly applied)\n4. Finally, the operation should be 8※10, but we previously determined the need to evaluate 8※10 which we stated would equal 24 but missed the sequence correctly in explanation. The actual operation we should focus on, given the sequence and correcting for clarity is realizing we mistakenly jumped to an evaluation without addressing the sequence properly in explanation.\n\nGiven the proper sequence and acknowledging the oversight in explanation but not in calculation, let's clarify the final step based on the rules provided without adding confusion:\n\n- Correctly we have 8 from the operation before the last step.\n- We should then calculate the final operation as presented originally but ensuring clarity: The operation 8※10 or any operation following the sequence should adhere strictly to the given rules.\n\nHowever, the final operation in the sequence provided (Step 4) was misstated in the explanation process but not in calculation: It's about understanding the correct sequence was evaluated but not properly detailed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"}

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4.

Simplifying these fractions gives us y = 4 or y = 1/4.\n\n## Step 13: Recall that y = log base 3 of X\nGiven that y = log base 3 of X, we have log base 3 of X = 4 or log base 3 of X = 1/4.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for X\nSolving for X in both equations gives us X = 3^4 or X = 3^(1/4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the value of X\nCalculating the value of X gives us X = 81 or X = 3^(1/4).

This means we need to integrate the function f(x, y) with respect to x and y over the given limits of the region D.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the function and the region\nThe function f(x, y) is given as x^2 + y^2.

Evaluating these from 0 to 2 gives us [(8/3)(2) + (2/3)(2^3)] - 0.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression [(8/3)(2) + (2/3)(2^3)] gives us 16/3 + 16/3, which equals 32/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{32}{3}}$"}

The function g(x) is given as x, and its derivative g'(x) is 1.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the operation rule to find f□g.\nUsing the operation rule f□g = f'(x) + g'(x), we substitute the derivatives found in Step 1. Therefore, f□g = sec^2(x) + 1.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the expression for f□g at x = π/4.\nTo find the value of f□g when x = π/4, we substitute x with π/4 in the expression from Step 2. So, f□g = sec^2(π/4) + 1. Since sec(π/4) = √2, we have sec^2(π/4) = 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value.\nSubstitute sec^2(π/4) = 2 into the expression from Step 3. Therefore, f□g = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"}
