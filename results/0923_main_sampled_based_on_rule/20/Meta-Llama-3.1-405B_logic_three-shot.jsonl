Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S** is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C** is what?\n4. **Q** is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[%]]\n\n---\n以上便是总结的卡尔纳普分析方法模型,您可以制定模板,照着卡尔纳普分析方法的解题思路,制定类似的模型来提高你的解题效率!\n```\n"}

For instance, let's say that we have two options for pursuing our career aspirations: Option A and Option B. We believe that following either of these paths will lead us towards achieving our goals. However, we are unsure which option is the better choice. In this case, we need to evaluate each options' premises to see if they support the conclusion that it leads to success. This evaluation typically forms the basis of hypothetical syllogism deduction."}

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nIn this dialogue, B’s response “She will do her best” is somewhat vague and does not directly address whether “she will be able to complete the project on time.” This response suggests that the statement “she will complete the project on time” might not be true, as “doing her best” indicates there is a risk she might not finish on time. \n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Please provide the recommended accommodation, activities, and estimated expenses, as well as explain the decisions in a formal, logical reasoning format.\n\n### Answer:\nProvided Conditions:\n* Traveler: 72 years old (an older adult)\n* Accommodation options: [Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, Hostel]\n* Activity options: [Cycling, Outdoor camping, Sea diving]\n* Expenses: As low as possible\n\nAccording to the given rule: \"Safety Concerns: If the traveler is an older adult or a person with a disability, avoid recommending accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes.\" we apply the following logic:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n    - The traveler is considered an older adult (meeting the age criterion).\n    - Possible accommodations include Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, and Hostel.\n    - Activities include Cycling, Outdoor Camping, and Sea Diving.\n\n2. Apply the logical operation or reasoning pattern:\n    - The safety rule states not to recommend accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes to older adults. \n    - We exclude Mountain-view villa from the accommodation recommendations since it involves a significant altitude.\n    - We exclude Sea Diving from the activity recommendations since diving can be considered potentially risky for older adults due to increased water pressure at depth, which could lead to health complications like decompression sickness or barotrauma.\n\n3. Ensuring output conforms to the specified notation and symbols:\n    - We choose the lowest cost accommodation among the remaining two options, Non-rapid hotel and Hostel, based on expense minimization.\n    - Similarly, we choose the least expensive activity among Cycling and Outdoor Camping, ensuring comfort and safety while meeting budget constraints.\n\nOur final recommendation is:\n\n**Recommendations**: \n* _Lowest cost accommodation_: **Non-rapid hotel** (**reason**: meeting safety requirements and minimizing expenses)\n* _Low-risk activity_: **Cycling** (**reason**: safer option for older traveler and cost-effective, avoiding high-altitude risks and high-cost activities)"}
