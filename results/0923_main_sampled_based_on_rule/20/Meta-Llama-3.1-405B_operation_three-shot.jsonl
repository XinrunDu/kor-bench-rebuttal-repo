We will present several new rules. For each assignment, all rules in the corresponding group are effective. Try to apply them correctly. You should pay attention to the potential \"rain of diamonds\" problem and should solve it by referring to an example in the rule definition while presenting the answer.\n\nThe questions will become harder and harder. To perform well in the test scenario, you should follow the specified language rules as closely as possible.\n\n1. Operation ∪:\n   + Definition: The symbol A◎B denotes A∪B set A union set B.\n   + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2} and B={2,3} should be written as {1,2,3} without any additional spaces.\n2. Operation ∩:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◈B denotes A∩BSet A intersect set B.\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {2,3} without any additional spaces.\n3. Operation −:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◇B denotes A−B setAsubtraction setB\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {1} without any additional spaces.\n\n## Scenario\nIn this test scenario, you will take on the role of an intelligent debugger and use the three new mathematical operators to complete a series of challenges. Your goal is to apply the operators correctly and avoid any syntax errors. Good luck!"}

Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nA€B:=MAX_{0\nA and B are matrices.\nCompute A€B\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n### Answer:\n[[((2,4),(4,8))]]\n### Explanation:\nComputing A€B requires maximizing the product of the entries in corresponding positions in A and B. For example, the top left entry of A€B is 2, which is the maximum of 1*1=1 and 2*2=4. The bottom right entry of A€B is 8, which is the maximum of 3*3=9 and 4*4=16. This algorithm ensures that the product of entries in each position in the resulting matrix will be the largest possible.\n\n## Question 13\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations.
