Plaintext: \"TNKGPHLSYPV\" (Uppercase letters string without spaces and punctuation)\n2. Encryption Steps:\n   a. For each letter `p` in the given Plaintext:\n      1. Use reversed_alphabet for reverse mapping.\n         - For example, finding the position of T in standard_alphabet (index 20), replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet (index 20) Z.\n      2. Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order.\n         - For example, if the obtained letter is Z, it gets mapped to D (by moving 4 positions forward).\n      3. Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet.\n         - For instance, since D is the obtained letter at this step, it gets mapped to J (as J is the letter in the same position as D in the substitution_alphabet).\n   b. Continue these steps for all the letters in the Plaintext, and the final ciphertext will be \"QFUONBJXKADJ\".\n\nThis is the encrypted answer in the double square brackets format specified in the rules."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[KHSZGWAJGZTDC] to encrypted answer for plaintext \"FAKXEDNHFFB\"]\n\nNote: The given plaintext \"FAKXEDNHFFB\" does not fit the restriction of only containing uppercase letters. To encrypt the corrected plaintext (by replacing the lowercase characters with their uppercase equivalents), we can use the specified encryption rules and keystream algorithm.\n\nFirst, let us prepare the initial sequence of cards:\n\n[9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n\nWe can now use the keystream algorithm with the initial sequence of cards to generate the keystream for each character of the plaintext.\n\n Following the Encryption Steps with plaintext \"FAKXEDNHFFB\":\n\n 1. For \"F\", we get x = 6 (position of 'F' in the LETTERS list)\n 2. Generate keystream value y for \"F\":\n            y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            Here, y = 23\n 3. z = (y + x) % 26 = (23 + 6) % 26 = 29\n 4. Append the letter corresponding to z(29) to the ciphertext: C\n 5. Continuing this process for each character of the plaintext, we get the ciphertext: CDPAKLIIAD\n\n Since the plaintext was originally \"FAKXEDNHFFB\", it seems there was a mistake in input. Correcting the plaintext to \"F A K X E D N H F F B\", we can apply the encryption rule to find the encrypted answer:\n\n Following the Encryption Steps with plaintext \"F A K X E D N H F F B\":\n\n 1. For \"F\", we get x = 6 (position of 'F' in the LETTERS list)\n 2. Generate keystream value y for \"F\":\n            y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            Here, y = 4\n 3. z = (y + x) % 26 = (4 + 6) % 26 = 10\n 4. Append the letter corresponding to z(10) to the ciphertext: J\n 5. Following this process for each character of the plaintext, we get the ciphertext: JDPAKVACDZ\n\n Therefore, the encrypted answer is [[JDPAKVACDZ]] for plaintext \"F A K X E D N H F F B\""}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[I]].\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n- Identify the plaintext: \"U\"\n- Identify the periodicity: 3\n- Identify the increment: 5\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - \"U\" is the first character, so find its position in outer_disk: 'U' is at index 21 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 21st character as 'U').\n  - Now find the character at index 21 on the inner_disk: 'I'.\n  - There have been only one character processed (since the plaintext is only one character), but we have to rotate the inner_disk by the given increment because of the periodicity. Rotate the inner_disk 5 characters to the right; new inner_disk: \"SJHFDGABCknMQWVYXZ\".\n\n- Now we encrypt the remaining plaintext (since periodicity is 3, we need two more characters): \"\". For now, we just store the first empty character as a placeholder. Encryption Steps (with placeholder):\n  - Placeholder character position on the outer_disk: 0, placement on inner_disk: 0.\n  - After encrypting the first character, rotate the inner_disk by the given increment of 5: new inner_disk: \"BCONLYXWVZjhgfadipqrstku\". Since we don't have a second character in the plaintext yet, we will use the placeholder as the second character, but don't worry, this will be swapped with the real second character when it is provided.\n\n- Now let's introduce a second character. Let's assume the second character is 'V'.\n  - Find its position in the outer_disk: 'V' is at index 22 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 22nd character as 'V').\n  - Now find its corresponding character on the current inner_disk: 'B' at index 2.\n  - We have now encrypted \"UV\"\n  - To rotate the inner_disk again, we continue from where we left off, rotating the inner_disk by increment value: new inner_disk: \"AOFNPEDQrmLTzyXWVzkjhgfadiSQ\".\n- In this case, there are no more characters to encrypt, and the resulting ciphertext for \"UV\" is: [[I, B]]."}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ASKCPZLVYKD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[NKCBCXPCXTRBJV]].\n\nUsing the provided encryption rules:\n\n1. The plaintext \"ASKCPZLVYKD\" (without spaces or punctuation) is given.\n2. The 6x6 matrix is the same as in the rules.\n3. The encrypted character set is \"ADFGVX\" as in the rules.\n4. The steps for encryption are as follows:\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (A through D):\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that letter in the 6x6 matrix.\n        - Find the positions of the numbers of rows and columns in the encrypted character set (\"ADFGVX\"). The positions are (0, 1) for rows and (5, 0) for columns, resulting in the encrypted binary (D, X).\n    - Concatenate all the encrypted binaries: (D, X)(K, C)(C, B)(B, C)(X, P)(P, C)(C, X)(P, C)(X, R)(R, B)(J, V).\n    - Read all rows of the consecutive encrypted binaries and then read all columns of the consecutive encrypted binaries to get the final ciphertext: NKCBCXPCXTRBJV.\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is [[NKCBCXPCXTRBJV]]."}

Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[ALPHABET]]\n\nFirst, I need to prepare the key from the provided SHA_256 hash value: '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'\n\n Here's the decryption process:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\" to a sequence of bytes (hexadecimal values correspond to ASCII values using the following mapping: 0-9, a-f).\n2. Perform bitwise different-or (XOR) operation for each pair of bytes in the sequence (plaintext byte and key byte) using the prepared key.\n3. Convert the decrypted sequence of bytes back to an uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nLet's do the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. Ciphertext to byte sequence:\n   - \"27b8\" gives us cipher byte 0x27 (45), \"7303\" provides cipher byte 0x73 (115), \"8e20\" gives us cipher byte 0x8e (142), \"27f8\" provides cipher byte 0x27 (45), \"5fba\" gives us cipher byte 0x5f (95), \"0b\" provides cipher byte 0x0b (11).\n\n2. XOR operation (using the key obtained from SHA_256):\n   - 45(cipher byte 0) XOR 73 is 28, 115 (cipher byte 1) XOR ef is 9e, 142 (cipher byte 2) XOR 7f is ce, 45 (cipher byte 3) XOR 2a is 7d, 95 (cipher byte 4) XOR fe is 79, 11 (cipher byte 5) XOR 04 is db.\n\n3. Byte sequence to plaintext:\n   - The decrypted byte sequence is [45(R), 9e(N), ce(L), 7d(M), 79(O), db(K)]. Converting this decimal numbers to uppercase letters, we get: ['R', 'N', 'L', 'M', 'O', 'K'].\n\nFinally, let's combine the letters and put them inside double square brackets: [[RNLOMK]] as the decrypted answer."}
