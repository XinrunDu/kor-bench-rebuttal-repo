First, let's examine the multiples between 19 and 28. Neither 19 nor 28 is a multiple of the other.\n2. Next, let's calculate 19※28 based on the given rule: Since 19 is not a multiple of 28, we have 19 apartments (a) and 28 buildings (b). According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n3. Now, let's combine 19 apparently 28 with the next operation 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 28 (or 19), their operation results in 24. These results can be written as (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp = 24.\n\n4. Then, let's perform the stamped operation with 104 and 13. Because 104 is a multiple of 13, we have 104 houses (a) and 13 apartments complexes (b). According to the rule, achts (104 houses) apt (13 apartments complexes) = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 apartments complexes.\n\n5. Finally, let's perform the last stamp operation with the new result (10 apartments complexes) and 4. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, their operation results in 24. We can write this as (10 apartments complexes) estamp (4 units) = 24.\n\n6. Combining all the results from the stamp operations gives us the final answer: (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp (4 units)  stamp (104 houses  apartments complexes) = 24 × 24 = [[576]].\n\nThe answer is [[576]]."}

If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]]."}

Square root of -72:\n  Since -72 is negative, we need to find a complex number i times its conjugate (-72i) and take the average:\n  sqrt(-72) = sqrt(72i \\* -1) = sqrt(72i) = ((72i)^(1/2)) \\* i = 8.48528137423857 \\* i\n\n2. Square root of 284:\n  We can see that this number is positive, so we can directly find its square root:\n  sqrt(284) = 16.83715254708384\n\n3. Calculate X:\n  X◎2 = (sqrt(284) + 8.48528137423857i) \\* (sqrt(284) - 8.48528137423857i)\n  X◎2 = 284 - (64.98141275058314 \\* i)^2\n  X◎2 = 284 - 4187.195629148172\n  X◎2 = -4160.195629148172\n\nNow, we need to find the principal square root of X◎2 (the positive solution):\n\nprincipal square root of X◎2 = sqrt(-4160.195629148172) = -64.58454550516173 + 8.48528137423857i\n\nFinally, we'll find X by taking the square root of X◎2 and disregarding the imaginary part:\n\nX = sqrt(-64.58454550516173 + 8.48528137423857i) = -8.000953973643857\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer as a real number. Since X is a complex number and we only considered its real part, let's take that value as our answer:\n\n[[-8]]\n\nThe final answer is -8."}
