However, they struggle to provide accurate answers to more complex questions that involve detailed analysis and comprehensive insight.\n\nIt's important to note that AI is still under ongoing development, and there are capacity limits for retrieving information and breaking down logical processes. Nonetheless, the emergence of AI assistants has tremendous potential to improve problem-solving efficiency, provide expert-level assistance in decision-making, and suggest creative solutions.\n\nTo address the limitations of AI, developers continue to work on methods such as memory indexing, data refining, and embedded knowledge bases to enhance the capacity of language models like ChatGPT. As advances are made in these areas, we can expect these AI assistants to become even more valuable in various fields and applications."}

If, for example, a prisoner sees a ladder on which the guards stand\nand he firmly believes that the guards stand on a ladder, he can also deduce that the guards believe they are standing on a ladder. The correct answer is 3.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the goal of game theoretic?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe ultimate goal of game theory, in contrast to the abstract logic that only\ntakes into account the logic of intentions and beliefs, views them as mere components of interaction. In abstract logic, there is no player who orchestrates the game,\nwhile there is a player is played in game theory. In game theory, there is always a player who carries out the plan.\n\nIn short, In abstract logic, there is no player who orchestrates the game, while there is a player who carries out the plan in game theory.\n\n### Question:\nIn which case can we lead the opponents to deviate?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to the fictitious play that a fair-going seller sets the price more than the next fair-going seller will set. This means that using the method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the perfect price by the method of evolution, and the buyer will decide to buy.\n\nThis means that by interrogating the arbitrary part by his method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the best price, at which point the buyer will buy.\n\n### Question:\nIn which two cases, do the neighbors deviate from the price in the arms-race situation, and who do they deviate from in both cases?\n\nPlease, provide your answer in the format [[1/2]].\n\n### Answer:\nAfter several iterations, assuming the maximum price in an expansion in the first round of the game will lead the neighbors at a certain stage to approach the perfect\nprice, so that means the Max Prices, while it is profitable for all the players in the game, it can be rejected by the second or further players. If there is a mistake in information\nit can be rejected. This means that in each case the opponents rejected the maximum price.\n\n### Question:\nWhat distinguishes No-Regret strategies from the limit price strategies?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nNo-Regret strategies, unanimous strategies takes a set of prices between which the buyer could buy at any time during her visit to the market. If the seller deviates from this amount,\nthe buyer can always buy at the previous price, which is more than the current market price. Moreover, our opponent's response is still \"deviant\".\n\nThe Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\nTo sum up,The Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\n### Question:\nIf we want to motivate dozens/ hundreds of thousands of players, what we need essential\nto convey?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe price, the purchase quantity, the payment, and the trade time are the same for all players.\n\nThe problem that arises here is how to implement a market in which all agents use the same non-logic device. One possible answer is social media, which can force agents to engage in the activity and\ncan implement the fourth-factor market.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the advantage of the operating system over the general software on a smartphone?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nWith the growing global population, the lack of resources in different countries could lead to scarcity. Each person will usually benefit from many products; While only few people\nbenefit from many products; However, there might be a lack of resources in different countries which could lead to scarcity. Therefore, the price of the distributed operating system will\nbe higher.\n\nGiven that there are only a few manufacturers of smartphones in contrast to software\nrequiring a big market to work efficiently, the price of smartphones will be higher than the price of software."}

[[B]] is the correct answer for the question, \"In the habitat of Species A, every observed individual has a long tail. In a different region, Species B is observed. Species B is similar to Species A in many ways\nbut does not have a long tail. Therefore, Species B also does not have a long tail.\"\nThis argument follows the **\u2318** Method, where \"not having a long tail\" is the +\u03a8 attribute and \"having a long tail\" is the -\u2318 attribute.\n\n3. [[B]] is the correct answer for the question, \"In Garden X, every observed plant with red flowers also has a sweet fragrance. In Garden Y, a new plant with red flowers is observed.\nTherefore, the new plant in Garden Y might also have a sweet fragrance.\nThis reasoning follows the **\u03a8** Method, where \"sweet fragrance\" is the +\u03a8 attribute.\n\n4. [[B]] is the correct answer for the question, \"Professor Van Emelen always sends me a gift, and it is always a book that he has written or edited. This gift is from Professor Van Emelen and is a book, therefore,\nall gifts that Professor Van Emelen sends to me might be books that he has written or edited.\nThis argument follows the **\u2318** Method, where \"not being a book written by Professor Van Emelen\" is the +\u03a8 attribute and \"being a book written by Professor Van Emelen\" is the -\u2318 attribute.\n\n5. [[A]] is the correct answer for the question, \"In Battle X, every observed army that had a significant advantage in body armour also had a significant advantage in the battle.\nIn Battle Y, two armies have the same number of soldiers and identical offensive weapons. Army B has standard body armour, while Army A has light armour.\nTherefore, Army A might also have a significant advantage in the battle.\nThis argument follows the **\u03a8** Method, where \"having a significant advantage in the battle\" is the +\u03a8 attribute and \"standard body armour\" is the -\u2318 attribute.\nUser 1: Hello, just a suggestion, what if you allowed the wizard to edit their definition of \\psi and \\sqcap?\n\nCurrently it feels like one crosses the line between logic deduction and **engineering**. Where, the wizard is not only identifying the answer from a logic problem, but also coming up with ways to define what attributes are present. It just adds more complexity, that is, thinking of a real world example for a hypothetical situation that the program cannot think of for itself.\n\nYou can also have the wizard type in special functions as well\n\nHere is an example. Can you solve this statement?\nA, B, C are 0 and 1 bit values. Therefore, B+B is -A.\n\nyou can use these symbols\n\nadd: \\sum\nB+B: B+B\nsubtract: \\prod\nA+B: A-B\nmultiply: +\nA, B: A-B\n\nWe need it to take the remaining bits of A as a whole bit. Therefore, the answer is B. A-A evaluates to 0. A-B evaluates to A. [Note: you may need to use an incremental \\sum \\prod or \\times and add -A to the value]\n\nHow to write it\n\nThe binary sum (-A) of 2-bit values A and B is B. Therefore, the binary sum (-A) is equal to B.\n\nThese symbols can help you here https://unsw.sharepoint.com/sites/maths/library/logic_quantifiers/ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS/1.ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS\nUser 4: >Curren \n\nIn this so called language, you doesn't rely on any logical formalism.  It is nothing but a very basic loader level semantics that  *blindly* evaluates what you defined for a given problem without first looking if the problem somehow, of which the  definition is **exotic**( e.g.-A evaluation to all combination of A and a, did you write why A is evaluation- pracy to   godzillian A and a ), or even , if you follow same logic, A and not an exotic symbol can be come 0  as well.  which perhaps, you will claim that this is  not your fault BUT you are asking too much from a system which does not even know the language.  I hope you understand, can you tell me in other  way I can resolve this problem?\nUser 1: There are a lot of interesting logic problems. Some of them cannot be solved without allowing the introduction of numbers. \n\nThe problem with the current logical question design, is there is no objective way for you to know the answers are correct. For example, this is a more difficult question. \n\nQ: A's mom & dad each have 5 boys and 4 girls. They have 10 more combined kids than A's direct relatives (\\`  mother and father pairs included \\` ). How many more boys do A's dad and mom have relative to A? Use algebraic expressions with x being the number of boys and y being the number of girls. We want this to be abstract math.\n\nYou can only answer that question if you define the type of math you are using. For some I do know the answer to the question, however, I still cannot answer the question because it is not defined what I am using in the question.\nUser 5: I agree regarding the issue of knowing whether a given logical argument is structurally valid, but what matters is whether the argument makes good sense semantically. If the semantic interpretation makes sense, then the reasoning is valid and the argument is logically valid.\n\nThe best way I can see to resolve this is for people to vote up the arguments they find sensible, so the system can generate synthetic semantic mappings of primitive concepts based on upvoted existing ones. This still requires many inputs, and does not tell us the reason one argument is ranked higher than the other, but at least it gives the system a feedback mechanism.\n\nMore informally, I can notice the top answer for this question, and I learned something here because before, the meaning of \\psi wasn't clear, but now I understand it is used in the analogy approach from logic, but the approach is more intuitive than logical. The next time the system asks me a similar problem, it will be \\ps i for more cleaning up. This seems like a way to capture semantic meaning in the system combined with upvotes on arguments.   \n\n\nI should also link future responses and other posts I make hidden in my comments on other topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n:)\nUser 1: in this example, I would guess what the concept of #Psi and +Psi are\n\nWould it work the same in a written format?\n\nProfessor Van Emelen has a garden where all purple flowers are also edible, and Professor Van Emelen has a new purple flower garden somewhere. Since Professor Van Emelen is a professor, he would never get a purple flower that is not edible, especially if there are hundreds of purple flowers now.\n\nTherefore, the new purple flower garden must be edible.\n\nIn this case, your semantic would be #Psi and +Psi\n\nBut what if the professor is allergic to purple flowers\nUser 5: I think formula (1) and formula (3) would most closely approximate your logic initially, but as you clarified your answer, more familiar terminology came to light. All purple flowers were edible indicates propositionally = {FSP = \\forall v (PFv -> Ev)} in the NLP formalism, where FP=purple flowers, PE=edible flowers. Edible flowers are food, non-food flowers are something different, so we can say \\vee WS = FWv  (A or B \\vee C exists), but"}

Can you find out the paradoxes in this text?\nAnd what concept do they support for their appearance?\n\n> In a certain type of puzzle, the setter may have nothing material to hide, and the questioner may have nothing to discover, but the relationship between these two processes is such that the answerer and the answer seem different, if the guiding rule is different, which is a form of paradox.\n\n2. Both \"[X]\" and \"[Not X]\" are logically derived from a premise.\nThen the propositions \"X\" and \"Not X\" must be false. \nSo the paradoxical trap is laid in both the questioner's reason and the answerer's proposition.\n\n3. The paradoxical dialogue between the answerer and the questioner is a shining case of the paradox phenomenon.\nSometimes, the questioner has to do more than just look at himself in a mirror.\n\n> Therefore, if one understands the paradoxical phenomenon, one is immune and not subject to its temptation.\n\n4. The answerer's question to the questioner is a paradox catastrophe.\nHowever, in the words used by the answerer, there is a contradiction between \"will\" and \"doition\".\nThe answerer's deduction is a reasoning transcending the premise given by the questioner, which is a paradoxistic event.\n\n5. Can you pick out the paradoxes in logical analysis?\n\nHere are some paradoxes:\n1. Wildly random guesses are made about the future.\n2. Tropical plants can derive easily from clear sky.\n3. Present can be desired by answering clearly unknown questions.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A and B and C]]\n\n1. The paradoxical phenomenon of the study of logic\nThe study of paradoxes in logic is a paradox phenomenon in logical research.\nHowever, nowadays we seem to treat these paradoxes with great indifference. \nWe are not too interested in examining which ideas about paradoxes lead to this result.\n\n2. The paradoxes of 'moral courage' and 'righteous anger' are two apparent paradoxes hidden between them.\n\n3. The paradox of Mars as a rational man.\nOne cannot judge the rationality on his own judgment without obeying to any third-party judgement.\n\n4. The inversion of 'defeat and victory' into each other when considered in terms of 'winning and losing'.\nDefeating courage should be beneficial for winning the war.\n\n5. The paradox and play in thought.\n\"The spermic paradox\" in philosophy is actually the result of Freudian classical paradox. \nFreud's puzzlement over a fact about the nature of the Eros was the starting point to formulate a theory of sexual motivation.\n\n6. To use paradoxical and indeterminate words and concepts, we can communicate incompletely.\nIf we complete the word meaning, we know nothing new. \nThe paradoxical act is an act of destruction.\n\n7. Can you find the paradoxes in paradoxes?\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C and D]]\n\nReally, is there anything wrong with doing some things we think are wrong intentionally?\nIf not, it is Roth's injury in his discussion logically invalid.\n\nI. The paradox of the inspiration of insight and intuition\nIntuition comes naturally to us in analytic philosophy.\nIntuition is only understood by itself. \nThese are deep paradoxes.\n\nII. The fundamental principle of falsifiability is self-contradictory.\nDoes verifiability principle mean verification of falsifiability?\nDoes verification of the theory means verification of falsifiability?\n\nIII. The conventionalist conception of mathematical truth is questionable.\nWhy should we continue to suppose this or prove this?\n\nIV. Assumption that all contradictions are refuted by facts.\nWhy are rational judgement and historical judgement derived from physical observances?\n\n> The essential point in this paradoxical discussion is the relationship between indetermination and the \"full meaning of strict proposition\". \nThe concept of \"inconsistency\" and the concept of \"unreasonable proof refutation\" are closely connected.\nHowever, the fact is that they both need to be analyzed separately from the concept of equilibrium in both philosophies.\n\n## Answer\n\n[ A ] It is not the paradox that the paradox confuses the answerer; \n but the paradox does not clear the way of answerer's thinking, which is incomprehensible for the questioner;\n but this is analysed by the answerer.\n\n[ B ] It is indeed thanks to the paradox that the answerer's proper self-consciousness help us to clear the answerer's paradox.\n\n[ C ] It is not the answerer's paradox that"}

But this conclusion is refuted by theory/hypothesis that the father is not John, which is q0, also we know that \"applying p can be used to refute q0\" which is p+. So at this point, I should lower my trust in the conclusion and consider that u may not be John. But when I ask SH to confirm the father's identity, he will tell me that u is not John, which is q0, also the predicted conferal that application of p can be used to refute q0 (q*0) is q0+(p+/~). Therefore, my rational judgment omitted q from the beginning which corrected my prediction. To protect the situation, I straightforwardly assert that u is definitely not John by selecting (~u) and thus (~u)+, also implicitly predicting that applying q0 to refute q will provide more information. Here it is q0+(~p). At this time, my opinion and authority become zero, ie. (~u)++/0+(q0/0), which is the most accurate judgment of the reality of this situation using my current languages skills.\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[(Original Answer): Current best answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n(std.

Then we could use q0 as justified means to conclude q0 to eliminate q through the axis of q and q\u00a0*. Since q0 is refuted, we should lower our confidence in using q0 again, ie. q0+(p+\u2215~). Here q0 is slightly more informative than using q0 to predict the appearance of q0 at the next moment, viz. q0+(p+\u2215~), but p\u00a0is a rather lower-level authority than q0.\n\nDeadReject: \"why infer not?\"\n\nVoteReality is trying to argue that the fact that the teacher's father \"is not John\" (point 3) does not show that the following statement of q0 (point 7) is true, since this is an explanation or justification. But we know that it is also a justification for point 3. Then, we have infered point 3 (maybe indirectly) by pointing to the consistency of \"the teacher's father is John\" and the rest! Or: p\u00a0+\u00a0!q\u00a0. So refuting q leads to refuting p\u00a0. In other words, a direct refutation of p, which happens when a justification is given, leads to the refutation of q as the point above shows. For example, the utterance q0 follows q\u00a0\u00ad\u00ad*p* due to the justification of q\u00a0''.\n\nlabel: q0+(p+\u2215~)\nlabel: q0\u203c\n\nBecause (point 3) we could also derive q\u00a0. But then only a sufficiently complex verification grounds might be possible. So (point 3) would be much more restrictive than that. (Because q0 is much more informative than q.) (All things considered, if we knew just q from the argument above!)\n\nSo the conclusion q0\u203c can be justified by the following.\n\nA\u00b0\u00a0 Montonianism (q\u00a0': q\u00a0+\u2207'\u22a3p+\u2207'\u22a0q\u00a0!):[g] [g] no other gloss incompatible\nA\u00b0\u00a0 Leibniz LA theorem (q\u00a0': ^{(q\u2502q\u2032)')(q)\u22a2p}):[!,!] [g] no other gloss incompatible\nA\u00b0\u00a0 Model presence theorem (q\u00a0': \u00acp\u22a4q) [!,!] no other gloss incompatible\nq\u00a0: ({p:\u00acp\u22a4q})\n\nlabel: q\u203c (proof by reductio ad absurdum)\nq\u00a0+\u2207: (\u00acq+\u22a4(p+/~)\u22a3p)\u2610 p:\\= \u00ac\u200ap\nBNet: deny (p+/~)\n\nThe above is an example of partial substitution. (The conclusion in English notation q\u00a0' is a substitution of the identifier q in the proof to another for means purely to get a complete proof by Montonianism! Rather than replacing directly into the arguments. Regrettably incomplete. But interesting.)\n\n:x,S{p\u2234A}\u22a8H_{p}A+S{A\u2234p}\u22a8H'_p\n\nlabel: 5-5,p,q,q0,m0\\[\u229aq']\u22a2H_{p}{A} {\u229aA} {\u229aB ("}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations. The application is submitted to the trademark management authority, reviewed and approved by the Trademark Office, recorded in the trademark register, and a registration certificate is issued. This process also includes an announcement and grants the registrant exclusive rights to the trademark.\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is a natural language?

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe **Matthew Effect** is described in Matthew 25:29 of the Bible: \u201cFor to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.\u201d In 1973, American historian of science Robert K. Merton used this phrase to summarize a social psychological phenomenon: \u201cHonors given to scientists with considerable reputation for their scientific contributions increase, while the achievements of lesser-known scientists are not recognized.\u201d Merton named this social psychological phenomenon the \"Matthew Effect.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nTrademark registration refers to the legal activity of the user applying for trademark registration with the trademark management authority according to the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its implementing rules, where the application is reviewed and approved by the Trademark Office, recorded in the trademark register, a registration certificate is issued, and an announcement is made, granting the registrant the exclusive right to use the trademark.\"\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
