This airplane has 100 seats, 40 of them are on the left side of the plane and 60 of them are on the right side. Customer A likes to buy a two-person's ticket for the HCA-3250, for example, A wants one seat on the left side and one seat on the right side. While Customer B likes to buy four-person's tickets, for example, B wants four seats on the left side or four seats on the right side. Customer C prefers buying eight-person's tickets, for example, C wants eight seats on the left side or eight seats on the right side. The HCA-3250 is not allowed to carry any CPE(class P economy) passengers, only CBA(class B economy), CB?(class B premium), and CPP(class P premium) passengers. For a two-person's tickets, the ticket price for CB?(Class CBA) is six hundred dollars, CB?(Class CBP) six hundred and fifty dollars. For all the other possible four-person's tickets, the ticket price is eight hundred dollars, seven hundred and fifty dollars, or seven hundred dollars, depending on the buy locaion. For a eight-person's tickets, the ticket price for CPP(class CPP) is one thousand two hundred dollars. Let Arrive(XY) be a relation that X arrives in Y (usually X has a ticket to arrive in Y) that relations have three possible value, i.e., {TRUE(T), FALSE(F), and UNKNOWN(U)}. Relation Arrive(A,CBA) represents the relation between Customer A and his Hotels/Check In Arrangements. Declare a relation Arrive(A,CBA) that cannot represent the relationship between Customer A and the hotel in his arrival city, if A does not buy any CB?(two-person's ticket) to the related destination or arrival city. For example, Arrive(A,CBA)=T→(∃b)[(Arrive(A,CBA,4)=T) + (Arrive(A,CPC)=T) + (Arrive(A,CPP)=F)]. Attribute X35X can ranges from 35 to 60.\n\nComput BP, the BP1's details are as follows. First, Customer A's seat matrix set is {{1,2,⋯,5},{{1,2,⋯,5},⋯, {X35X − 5,X35X},⋯,{{X35X − 5,X35X},⋯, {60,60}}}. Count the position at which the two Xs are adjacent, for example, {1},{2,3,...20},{1,2,...35,36},{1,3,...,39,40},...{60,61,...,75,76}. The seat number position, the number of CBA or CB?(B'Type passenger seats) is counted as its value. [ X35X−⁵,1 and X35X−⁵,X35X] can have different values.\n\nDeclare your seating matrix to be A{{1,2},...{X35X−⁵,X35X}} and B{{60,60}}. A and B are both sets with the positions shown in BP1. Then, apply operation RightSet(A), LeftSet(A), RightSet(B), LeftSet(B), A￡A, A￡B as assumed in this problem.\n\nDeclare BP2 is empty. A working assumption is that the arrival may not be performed. The logic below can be expressed in RPLC, but it was not required to express it in that format. RightSet(A)$B=R(H)$[ (Arrive(A,CBA)=T) + (Arrive(A,CPP)=T) ] A(H)$A=(A-RightSet(A))$A¿A Q=PlusIntegral[t](X)+[U](-t)LeftSet(B)$A=Q&(Arrive(H,CBA)=T)&(Arrive(H,CPP)=T)/*Arrive(H,CBA,4)=U*/(Dom(+numcostconomcomcomfitconcioma)* R1(Arrive,2))? A￡A?(U==False) Set B $Arrive(C)$X=B&(Arrive(H,CPP)=T)&(Arrive(H,CBA,?)=F)Declare B Jurisdiction B be a jurisdiction (B), limit its top B. Bp is the jurisdiction you require for the above feasibility example, so X-$t can no longer be called PassengerSeats(X,60) or Color(X,yellow,Black) ∣ x∈X .\"Travel Relations'' includes order relationships, as well as mxn billing and offering relations, including travel dimensions.Below are some examples:Declare the following information table:\n\nAssume that object [x in table \"order\" refers to 2 cannot be placed in S1, S1 in table \"situation\" is T~ S2 in table \"judgement\" referring to the red, red in table \"color\" refers to O ~ Orange in table \"color\" interpretation refers to R2~ in table \"jurisdiction\".However, there are many \"classification\" constraints: class EP does not allow YO~ non-ephemereis, nonighty does not allow S2, class A allows S1, A and class T only [grain size] = [bill type] [bill type] is group D, groups B and C reach one another, groups A and D reaches one another, groups A and C does not. \". . . .\" .
