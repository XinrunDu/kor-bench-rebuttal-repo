All I remember is that everyone earned between 0 and 499,999 dollars, and each line of the list contains the number that you need to start the line of letters that corresponds with the person's name. For these instructions, each space represents a single row of letters.\nThe pattern works like this: every row of letters has three letters and must be equally as long (that is at least 3 characters. Every word is 3 to 5 characters.\nThe pattern also requires that the first half, the designations of the letters, must occur in a specific order, such as this:\n```\n\n[L T D][[T H]]\n\n```\nG H\n```\nThe left half of a line may or may not be listed, and some letters may not appear in the left half.\n\nLetters on the right side answer the question which person received what salary.\n```\nRegular letters indicate that each person in the list received a salary, and a series of numbers (the way that phonetic numbers are listed, with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0) will follow that letter.\nThere are rare letters, which do not mean what they normally would, but instead represent the maximum number of decades between when two specific persons were actually paid that much money. Three such rare letters will be listed on one line of the list after the numbers are provided, and then all three rare letters will be immediately followed by another number, which is the maximum number of decades from the present that everyone earned that salary.\n\nFinally, the line of letters should be ended with the new line character \"\\n.\"\n```\n\nThe valid output should be the alphabetical list of the answers, starting at the left field and working its way to the right starting field. Make sure all the data is present in this order: the person's name, a space, the number of decadal lengths, the left side data starting characters, the rare letter for the person's salary, and finally the year since he/she was kick out, which should be at the end of the list of cents, if necessary.\nThe output must therefore repeat the final decimal character on every line of the list, and the decimal number that you are given indicates the year each person was instructed.\nFinally, the answer should be enclosed in two brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n^{[Anita,2132310,left,53 ,Ani,T,D,3],[Grant,17104,left,35 ,Gra,T,D,4],[[So,Th,Ed],[ Jo,Hart,F,4],[Y,Z,0]]}[Anna,The,Gra,0,w,2,1,0,3,2,w,2],[Dix,1,2,Anne,w,2,v,v,1,2,w,2],[Tina,C,Ani,r,w,2,2,0,2,w,2],[Ge,H,Y,w,2,3,4,2,w,2],[K,v,A,P,1,4,r,w,2,w,2],[L,w,c,2,5,r,w,2,w,2],[H,A,1,A,2,g,r,w,2,w,2]}\n\n### Question:\n1.Richie and Joaquin's practices both have more than 15 patients today, but Joaquin's practice has more patients.\n2.Gonzalo has fewer patients today than Cinthia.\n3.Dr. Mark is not part of Phuong-Hong Rez.\n4.Dr. Dina's practice has fewer than 25 patients, and she isn't part of Alhamd's practice.\n5.Dr. Grace's practice has more than 15 patients.\n6.Warren's practice has fewer than 15 patients today, but the ministry has more patients than his.\n7.Dr. Naomi Darla's practice is in Loughborough.\n8.The practice for Harvey is in Lough"}

In these cases, programmers typically face the following challenges:`\n> 1. Translating a problem from a natural language into specific code instructions\n> 2. Matching the required format for the output of their code, such as an array or a list, as specified by the problem description\n> 3. Paying attention to details, like ensuring that their code correctly handles edge cases or special instances of the problem mentioned in the question.\n> For example, the first question prompted you to answer based on a series of arrows pointing to the next direction in which to move, which involved translating a natural language rule into the specific code required to address and solve the problem. The second question prompted you to identify a specific set of elements, counting the number of times they appeared as required, while paying attention to the formatting of your answer. The third question involved correctly determining the next elements to include in each row of the given table with the proper formatting. These types of problems commonly arise in programming, highlighting the need for developers to effectively translate real-world problems into code. It’s also important to ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, including edge cases, to produce the desired output accurately."}

Your task is to fill in the grid with letters according to the given rules.\n\nHere are the rules that need to be followed:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid, and the question is presented in the form of a matrix containing X and 0.\n\n2. The player needs to replace X with letters (fill), and 0 with separators on the grid (separated is not to be filled with letters).\n\n3. Two lists of words are given, across for filling in the words from left to right, and down for filling in the words from top to bottom.\n\n4. During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. However, the letters that cross must match.\n\n5. The question consists of a list of words and a matrix with X and 0 values. The answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped."}
