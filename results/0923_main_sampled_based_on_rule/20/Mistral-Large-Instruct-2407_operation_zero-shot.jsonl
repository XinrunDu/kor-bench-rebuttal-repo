First, let's evaluate 104※13:\n   - 104 is a multiple of 13 (104 = 13 * 8).\n   - Thus, 104※13 = \\( \\frac{104}{13} + 2 \\).\n   - \\( \\frac{104}{13} = 8 \\).\n   - Therefore, 104※13 = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n2. Now substitute back into the original expression:\n   - The expression becomes 19※28※4※10.\n\n3. Next, evaluate 19※28:\n   - Neither 19 is a multiple of 28 nor 28 is a multiple of 19.\n   - Therefore, 19※28 = 24.\n\n4. Substitute back:\n   - The expression becomes 24※4※10.\n\n5.
