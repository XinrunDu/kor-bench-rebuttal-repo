His whereabouts have been a mystery to this day. Legend has it that Captain Crunch, an old sea dog, was the man to actually find it. In a bottle at the bottom of the mine, the privateer wrote a laconic dispatch:\n\n\"Tis hard to locate tis H-- now as water access is blocked W-- sinkins old leddy [sic] 95 yr over since. The location here in the gap where the Apache run springs which spawn a cove over a great azure spring, are the treasure keys: Over here 2 keepsake mementos are hid! Please visit me again next Sept 22nd!!!\"\n\nLikewise, cryptic tattoos covered Captain Crunch's body. At various points in his life, he apparently summoned one of his crew to cross his arms over a flat surface, drew a large stick figure of himself with a tall, fist shaped nose and a captain's hat on top. Then charred lines indicated its head twinkled in the rain. At various points in his life, he also instructed them to dig three shallow trenches containing iron bars and leave the largest one open. The inscription on these bars? Plenty o' parts, most broken. When his last loan for back paddin' was paid off, Captain Crunch almost yelled, \"I'm just back from the islands! I'm a clew out, but I won't say where 'til there's lots more adventure!\" And he pretty much said \"To hell with it\" and keeled over.\n\nCan you figure out where Captain Crunch hid his treasure chest? Use nothing but the clues Captain Crunch gave you in your attempt.\n\nCapture the videos of various steps clearly, and upload the whole video to your GitHub repo.\n\nSample video: https://twitter.com/MITMoriarty/status/1271995273737638848?s=20\n\nSubmission through Zoom button Below.\n\n### Links:\nhttps://english.kuash.news/news/captain-crunches-treasure-map-4725599\n\n### Prerequisite Information:\nNone\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the challenge description, including the relevant behavior regarding the physical clues one must follow.\n- In the sequence of actions described in the key, isolate the various letters or ciphertexts from the instructions. Use the formula provided below.\n- Place each of the letters using the below mentioned method, and make sure to keep the manuscript places in a convenient format.\n- Collect the letters in each manuscript and figure out the subtle meaning included in the clues with their location, and start with Build A clue to proceed further to Unlock a code!\n\n### Final Solution to Solve:\n\nGiven below is the Strategy to solve:\n\n1. **Transaction Balance:** The Transaction Balance can be calculated by acknowledging three things:\n    \n    - **Current Transaction Balance **: The current transaction balance is specific for each Cryptocurrency and blockchain network. Current wallet and on-chain account balances are included in the official transactions when you are sending cryptocurrency at a given moment.\n    - **Wallet Address Startup Balance:** A default amount is making a unique public address and private key pair for every blockchain wallet when we move from a central bank account to a self-custodial blockchain wallet. We can perceive it from many different perspectives and make a transaction. On a sensible account's balance depends on many different aspects, including the sender of the cryptocurrency, recipients, 0-relationship and the amount of transactions included in the block.\n    - **Transaction 0 fee:** The amount is automatically calculated by the blockchain when any parameters, including the transaction sender, recipients, amount, and confirmation methods, satisfies a transaction's execution rules. It is only required once.\n        - The transaction is charged with a particular fee and only added to the transaction fee if the block is bundled with another transaction fee or rejected from the transaction pool. For example, the way things are, there is no alternate at the moment for us to have a mining fee to improve our available transactions inside blocks. However, the miners, who accumulate a transaction, can take payment fees from the sender.\n    - **Mundane Transaction Fee and Retained Value:** Mundane transaction fees and retained values are the least essential things that need to get paid by the sender of the Transaction Balance transfer ready to keep the process moving. Thusly, the essential thing is that transaction sending address in Ethereum represents a \"blockfile transaction fee,\" which goes either to Ether _Gas price_ or \"blockfile transaction fee,\" An organization that will get the transaction fee by quietly taking care of the whole process of fee-picking and the real-time execution of smart contracts. The blockfile transaction fee also posts the smart contract to the blockchain and will be retained by removing the contract address from the blockfile. This address will no longer be a part of the EthTimer contract each time a new block is appended.\n\n2. Before we continue any further to the next step or mission ensured that the following:\n\n    - **Be sure to get the currency symbol, in which they require.**\n    - **Access the below mentioned link to get the denominations: https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/list-of-10-largest-metal-mining-plants-in-the-world.html**\n    - **If the currency amount is higher than 1, enter the currency amount as, for instance, 1=1,000.**\n- To get the transaction balance for the below-mentioned currencies, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n    - **First of all, the user is required to enter the required currency name.**\n    - **Then add the respective currencyid = symbol**\n\n    For eg. Cryptocurrency_RESULTS.csv = Poker Reserves  (PR).\n    Poker Reserves (PR) has **2.134e1015**\n\n3. Added the value of the blockchain, amount in the currency type and the equation.\n\n    Blockchain = Number of Blockchain Accounts * Denomination + Number of Blockchain Accounts * - Denomination\n\n    Amount = 100 - Max transaction amount\n\n    Each step's details can easily get from the below link. The details and video tutorial will help you understand more*.\n\n4. **Part 3:**\n\n-  The solution automatically generates the results based on the values passed in step - 2.\n-  **However, there is no direct way to figure out currency's transaction balance cursively.**\n-  Hence, the user is required to figure out the results displayed in crypto_results. The results are 10-digit long entries with two digits as 15.\n    \n5. Let's disable the false coins from the table that requires calculation.\n\n6. **More Details:**\n\n- Bitcoin = 1.75 billion\n- Bitcoin Cash = 253.84 million\n- Bitcoin Diamond = 501.26 million\n-"}

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

To represent the 'e', at the start of the pattern and at the end of each phrase, use '^','^'.\n    - Concatenate the three parts of the pattern with spaces in between, regardless of the previous transformations.\n    - Replace each duplicated character in the plaintext with '_'.\n    - Replace each character that appears more than once with * in uppercase letters.\n    - Replace the vowels from the plaintext with *AAAEIOUY (every uppercase letter is changed into a lowercase one).\n    - Replace each uppercase letter with a corresponding number letter, where the first 6 letters (each starting with A or B) are uppercase, with the first five lowercase letters starting with a character. The sixth character to every uppercase letter is 'a', with the seventh and last letter (the last vowel) being 'b'.\n    - Replace every other character that appears in the plaintext with a corresponding letter in the phrase (based on the position of that character in the pattern), encoded as shown in the table.\n    - Since the encryption rules are OR, replace the duplicate character near the decimal point, i.e., '/'.\n- Special Operations:\n    - To search for a phrase, use the search method to search for a phrase instead of using a regular expression.\n    - Every phrase must include 'dick'. If there is no such phrase, modify the pattern according to the existing phrases, so that 'dick' can be added to the last alphabet.\n    - If it is not possible to add 'dick' using the above method, add 'dick' to the last alphabet in 'th' form, with the lowest letter being lowercase.\n- Examples:\n    - \"frank. colonel. special operation. the\"\n    - [[4.6.3.2/frank.col.spec.op.the]].\n    - \"operation. john\"\n    - [[5/operation.john]].\n    - \"operation. dick. dick. dick. dick. dick\"\n    - [[5/operation.dick.dick.dick.dick.dick]].\n    - \"AC\"\n    - [[CCC/CC]].\n    - \"0.0001\"\n    - [[6/0.0001]].\n    - \"123456789012 /dick/1111/ operation\".\n    - [[123.456.789.012/dick/1111/ op.tion]].\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nLet's take the following example:\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n\nWhat is the decrypted answer?\n\nEvery valid combination in the duty has resulted in a final combination in the sentence, while a final sentence with 6 decimal points has ended. Therefore, it is safe to assume that an incomplete sentence is not a good combination. All possible combinations must have been accepted and compared, and are:\n\nSo, the length of the current question is: 37 characters. The length of the sentence is 16 and the last integer is 10.\n\nTherefore, your job now is to subtract: 10-16=6 (you are always right)\n\nAs a result, the final result will be the result of the hashed combination with the hashed answer. Therefore, \"6\" will be the answer of the encrypted identity.\n\n### Question:\n\"MD\"\n\nRequesting information:\n\nSpecialty: Frank's Colonel Special Operations before performing a Background Check on military drugs in Dodrick Dick Dick Dick's operation.\n\neHarmony\n\neHarmony\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[HCVFRWH]]\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis problem has two aspects.\n\n1. Ciphertext / Plaintext are mapped to each other.\n2. There are encryption and decryption operations.\n\nWhen the problem indicates that the ciphertext and the plaintext are not symmetrical, you can reduce the problem to the encryption and decryption operations. After the transformation is completed, the strings are symmetrical and look very close to the previous map operations. Therefore, the modern string manipulations can be regarded as the same as the problem's rotary transformations.\n\nIn addition, the current minimum O(1) or O(N2) complexity is not an effective solution. The main reason is the condition of CSP that the operations of reading and writing are restricted. And CSP is quite difficult to break without free access to read or write operations.\n\nHowever, you can solve this problem by:\n\n1. Preparing a maximum length of [plaintext] columns to store the plaintext and ciphertext items in a line of writing.\n2. Align the four rows of  \" \" and the four rows of \" # \".\n3. Align the even-numbered rows from right to left and the odd-numbered rows from left to right.\n4. Move all the multinational characters to other columns (not directed writing).\n5. Write on regular characters and the beginning of each multinational string.\n6. Transformation and reverse transformation are as close as possible under the limitation of restrictions.\n7. Any transformation after the restriction of CSP does not affect any content.

It basically performs the same function of zero padding before walking the stages of encryption or decryption. This is done because in most applications of the scheme, the data to be encrypted or decrypted is in general structured such that it can be easily tiled into fixed chunks of a specific size. One example of a use of ZeroPadDecryption is the encryption function at the Openssl project.\n\n\n- **Encryption Rules:**\n    1. ZeroPad: Pad the plaintext with `\\x00` (null character) to made every chunk a multiple of blocksize bytes long.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into blocks satisfying the rules below (each block of plaintext is blocksize bytes long).\n      - Each block contains only the characters `A-E` (uppercase letters).\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert the each block from plaintext encoding to byte encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR to each block between the block bytes and the fixed key.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n- **Decryption Rules:**\n    1.

Hex Decoding: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to hexadecimal string.\n    5. Trim Padding:\n        - Remove First Block: Remove the first block from the plaintext, as it will contain the encrypted padding ('\\x00' a null character).\n    6. String Decoding: Convert the plaintext back to its original form by reversing the hex mapping steps.\n    7. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Utils\n\n- `f.hex_dec_strs`: Convert a list of hexadecimal strings to a list of strings after decoding them from hex.\n- `f.hex_enc_strs`: Convert a list of strings into a list of hexadecimal strings.\n- `f.combine_hex_strs`: Take two separate lists of hexadecimal strings and combine them under a single list.\n- `f.pad_zero`: Add empty string characters (\\x00) to ensure that each list of hex strings is an integer multiple of 8.\n- `f.rsplit_every`: Split a hexadecimal string into chunks of size blocksize.\n- `f.split_every`: Split a hexadecimal string into chunks of size blocksize.\n- `f.pad_zero_every`: Add empty string characters (\\x00) to ensure each chunk is multiple size blocksize in size.\n\n### Policies:\n\n- Keys and Encryption Substitution Box (S_BOX) are fixed throughout the whole code.

Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For each letter in each text, its corresponding code number x is stored as the ciphertext.\n\nEach number x and its exponent e can uniquely represent each letter in the alphabet with a key value (\\tt 264-301), making it easy to transmit.\n\nThis rule is different from the congruent numbers (\\S04.06 Congruent Numbers.rp) because it adds restrictions.  For the same letter in the plaintext and the same string(e.g., text \"I\", \"WWI\"), the ciphertexts of different plaintexts are not congruent. The ciphertext ciphertext of plaintext \"I\" is always \"213\". Therefore, after the letter is coded as a number, there is no error in transmitting to the destination. It will be decoded to \"I\" and \"WWI\" according to different keys.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    \"\"\"\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n        \n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n    \n    return key_list\n```\n    \nThe \"key_list\" is the ciphertext of the plaintext. After encrypting, the code of each letter corresponds to a ciphertext. You only need to find the correct ciphertext corresponding to the message by comparing the code. The bigger the key_list is, the stronger the security of the ciphertext. At the same time, a large key list is also difficult to calculate.\n\n### The coding method:\n\n1. Write functions:\n    - Find the ciphertext that corresponds to each letter in the plaintext by comparing the code.\n2. Create a method:\n    - User input: Plaintext;Key word.\n    - Call iteration() function to get the ciphertext of the plaintext.\n    - Call decryption() function of the constructed method to find the decryption of each letter.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    '''\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    '''\n\n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n\n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n        \n    return key_list\n\ndef decryption(jeruxe_decrypt, length):\n    size_t = list(range(len(jeruxe_decrypt) - length + 1))\n    letter_list = ['']\n    \n    for t in size_t:\n        sum_ = 0\n\n        for number in jeruxe_decrypt[t:t + length]:\n            sum_ +=(int(number))\n        letter = ASCII_alphabet[(sum_ / (length*e)) % n]\n        \n        letter_list.append(letter)\n        \n    return letter_list\n\ncipher_total_input = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_input_list = iteration(cipher_total_input, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,…\") #算出对应的密文字符\n\n\noutput_result = cipher_input_list + \",\"+ \"]. \"\nprint(output_result)\n```\n\nAfter the iterative process, create a method named \"Decosion(code input, length input, number of key words input)\", which takes \"code\" (iteration() function generates ciphertext), \"length\" (number of consecutive ciphertext), and \"number of key words\" as inputs. Once the message is sent to the destination, the receiver searches for the key list that the enciphered message is fraction of the key list by LAPLACIANtraering.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/). There will be no repeated codes in each key list. Decode the characters corresponding to each code of the key list in order to form the plaintext.\n\n### User input:\n```\ncipher_total_text = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_text_list = iteration(cipher_total_text, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22…..\" #算出对应的密文字符\n```\n\n### Output result:\n\n### User input:\n\n```\nHence, we can construct the dectkon method:\n\ndef decryption(cipher_input_list, length_cipher_list, number_of_key_words):\n    \n    cipher_len = len(cipher_input_list)\n    len_of_selected_key = int(cipher_len / (n *e))\n    \n    normal_key = [cipher_input_list[length-len_of_selected_key:length] for length in range(len,len_of_selected_key+1)]\n    maximal_key = select_list(normal_key) #Select key list by LAPACIANtraing.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/)\n    \n    return_dict = dict()\n    \n    ascii_code_txtlist = ASCII_alphabets_list[normal_key]\n    \n    for each in ascii_code_txtlist:\n        each1 = (each / 24575) % n\n        key = INT_Ascii_alphabets[each1]\n        \n        character = each%n\n        \n        return_dict.update({key: character})\n```\n\nThe decryption method can be used to obtain the plaintext of the key word in the ciphertext."}

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules.
