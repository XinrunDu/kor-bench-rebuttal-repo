We know that the associate letters of A is 3, of B is 5.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[KkK]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. For each character 'P' and 'Z' in plaintext, we find their corresponding characters in the outer_disk 'W' and 'R', respectively.\n2. We find the positions of these characters within the inner_disk 'Y' and 'U'. After processing 'P', the inner_disk is 'YU'.\n3. The inner_disk is rotated by 5 characters (increment) after processing 'P'. So, at this point, the inner_disk is 'UY'.\n4. We process the 'Z' character. Its corresponding position is 'O' in the inner_disk. The inner_disk becomes 'VOO'.\n5. The inner_disk is rotated to the right again by 5 characters (increment). The inner_disk becomes 'UY'.\n6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AK]]\n\nExplanation of the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"KP\". In this rule, punctuation and spaces are not considered, so the alphabet characters are the only inputs.\n\n2. For \"KP\", there are two characters - \"K\" and \"P\". No punctuation and no J. We remove them. The resulting plaintext is \"K\" and \"P\".\n\n3. In the 5x5 grid, the coordinates of \"K\" are (4,1) and the coordinates of \"P\" are (2,4). Although there are 5 characters in the grid, we are told that there's no J, so we only use the remaining characters A-Z without J.\n\n4. The coordinates are arranged in the order: 286\n\n5. First, we find the row coordinates and read them in order: 26\n\n6. Next, we find the column coordinates and separate them into two halves: 2,4\n\n7. Next, read each half of the column coordinates, find the corresponding character in the grid using their row and column positions.\n\n8. For today, let's focus on the second half, the column coordinates: 2,4. Starting with the first element (4): we find the corresponding character, \"Z\". So, the second half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"Z\".\n\n9. Next, focus on the first half, the row coordinates: 2,6. The first element (2) corresponds to \"E\". So, the first half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"E\".\n\n10. The decrypted answer in plaintext is [[\"E\",\"Z\"]] or simply \"ZE\". Notice that the order of the characters in the plaintext is the opposite of the original order in the ciphertext.\n\nFollowing the decryption property, the final result in plaintext is \"ZE\". So, the answer to the given problem is [[\"ZE\"]] (double-square brackets encapsulating the decrypted answer)."}

This is done by wherever we see the columns' number in the given order (e.g., 2, 0, 6, etc.) If we encountered column 1 directly, we would consult the row in the transposed sequence table, as there is no column number in the given order at that point."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[BD7B7B7B]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The plaintext, \"G\", is padded with zeroes to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. Here, the padded plaintext is: \"G\\x00\"\n2. The padded plaintext is divided into 8-byte blocks (or bytes). Here, \"G\\x00\" forms one block.\n3. Block encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: The block \"G\\x00\" is encoded using ASCII to get the byte sequence \"47 00\"\n   - XOR with Key: \"47 00\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" (the uppercase versions of the hexadecimal characters)\n   - Substitute: Using the S_BOX, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, the byte sequence becomes \"BD 7B 7B 7B\"\n   - Permute: In this case, we rotate each byte by 1 bit. So, the byte sequence after rotation is \"7B 7B 7B 7B\".\n   - XOR with Key: \"7B 7B 7B 7B\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: The encrypted byte sequences are converted to hexadecimal string. \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" gets encoded as \"BD7B7B7B\"\n5. Concatenate: All the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks are concatenated to form the ciphertext \"[BD7B7B7B]\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[BD7B7B7B]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]] Explanation:\n\n1. We have given a ciphertext \"4\".\n2. As per the given encryption rules, we have to calculate the decimal value x for each character in the plaintext, by multiplying it with the ascii code of that character.\n3. For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11. Decrypted answer: [\"A\"]\n\nSo, the answer to the given ciphertext \"4\" would be:\n[[\"A\"]]"}
