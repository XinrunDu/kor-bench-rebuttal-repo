First, let's write down the equation:\n\n  O N E\n+ O N E\n+ T W O\n-------\n  F O U R\n\n1. Since F is the result of a sum having three digits in it (O + O + T), F must be equal to 1 or 2. It cannot be 0 (from rule 3) and it cannot be 3 or higher (as the maximum possible sum of three digits is 27). We'll assume F = 1 for now and adjust later if needed.\n2. O + O + T must equal 10 (to result in F=1 in the next column). Since O cannot be 0 (also from rule 3), and O cannot be equal to T, one of them must be 5 and the other 2. Without loss of generality, let's assume O=5 and T=2.\n3. Now, we need to solve for N and U. Since O=5, N + N should result in a one digit number plus a carry-over of 1 (since O + O = 10). So N + N = 9. The value for N therefore must be 4.\n4. U + E + a carry-over of 1 must result in R. We already know the possible values for E that haven't been used are 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, E cannot be 1 (since F already takes that value), and it has to be one of a pair that adds to 10 (resulting in a carry-over of 1). E and R can be 6 and 7 or 7 and 6, but we choose 6 for E and 7 for R. U therefore becomes 8.\n5. Lastly, T and W have to sum up to O (which is 5). Since T = 2 and W shouldn't equal letters with assigned values (F, O, N, E, R, U), W must be equal to 3.\n\nCheck if all letters have unique numbers: F=1, O=5, N=4, T=2, E=6, W=3, U=8, R=7, which is true. Therefore, the final answer is [[F=1, O=5, N=4, E=6, T=2, W=3, U=8, R=7]]."}

Since we have more letters than digits, multiple solutions may exist, but we'll aim for one valid answer. We apply the given rule as we proceed.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the problem:\n\n   EAT\n+ THAT\n= APPLE\n\n1. A cannot be 0 (from rule 3) and must be either 1 or 8 (from the sum rule, because otherwise, A+A would exceed 9, resulting in two digits, which in this case would lead to a five-digit sum). A cannot be 9 (since we need to carry over 1 to make A+A become 1 over 9), so A must be 1.\n2. We have a carry-over of 1 from A+A, so T=9.\n3. Because of the carry-over of 1, and since T=9, P must be 8. So, P=8.\n4. We have T=9 and E+H=10+L (because of the carry-over), the only possibilities for E+H=11 or E+H=21. Since there's no two-digit sum, E+H must be 11. Since E cannot be 0, H=2 and E=9, but T=9, so it is not possible to use E=9 again.\n   Consequently, there's a mistake at this step.\n   \nSince we've encountered a problem applying our assumption, let's revisit our approach:\n\nGiven that we made an error in the previous assumption for E, let's reconsider E+H=11. The smallest possible value for H that results in a sum of 11 would be H=3, which makes E=8. But E cannot be 8 since P=8. Thus, we choose H=5 and E=6. This fits our case for E+H=11. Now, H cannot be 0 and now E can be assigned different values than before.\n\nLet's update our assignments:\n\n* A=1\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* T=9\n\nWe now have:\n\n   6AT\n+ T5AT\n= 18PLE\n\nThe next step is to find L. Since E+H=11, we have 6+5=11. The carry-over for the next column gives us:\n\nT+A=L+1 \n\nSince T is 9, there are only possible values for A: 2, 7, or 8. A cannot be 7 or 8 since P=8 and E=6. Therefore, A has to be 2. This leaves L with a value of 6, but this is already assigned to E, so we've made another mistake.\n\nAfter another iteration, we learn that A=3, not 2, which makes L=7. Now we can safely assign T, P, E, A, H, and L.\n\nFinally, we can solve for the remaining values:\n\n* T=4\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* A=3\n* L=7\n* The remaining letters are I and N. There are values 0, 1 and 2 left and we need to find two distinct numbers from these to assign to I and N. Since T=4 and TAKES the place of T repeatedly, N must be 0. I would then be 2.\n\nThus, our final assignment is:\n\n* A=3\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* T=4\n* L=7\n* I=2\n* N=0\n\nFinal Answer: [[A=3, P=8, H=5, E=6, T=4, L=7, I=2, N=0]]"}

Start by filling the last row and the last column, as their sum values are given (3, 9, 4, 6 and 5).\n2. For the last row, place 1's in the first and the fourth cells to make the sum (3)\n3. For the last column, place 1's in the first and the last to make the sum (5). The intersection of the filled cells in the last row and the last column already has a total of 2, so we still need 3 more which we could add in the second row.\n4. For the last column, to make the sum (6), we need 1 more. So we could place it in the second row, which will make its sum (7). Here, we've overlapped a bit with the first step as the second row already had one 1 in the last column.\n5. Now, for the second column, as it has to total 9, we fill in the remaining cells except those already filled (3rd row, 3rd cell; 4th row, 4th cell; and 1st row, 5th cell). At this point, the sum of the 2nd column is already 7, so we need 2 more, one in the main diagonal (2nd row, 2nd column) and one in the third row (3rd row, 2nd column).\n6. For the third column, considering the sum 4, we fill the remaining empty cells except those already filled (4th row, 3rd cell; 2nd row, 4th cell; and 1st row, 3rd cell) in the same way as done for the second column. At this point, the sum of the 3rd column is 3, so we need one more, which will be in the 2nd row, 3rd column.\n7. For the first column, it needs a total of 5, so the sum 5 will be achieved by filling the last cell in the fourth row. At this point, the sum of the first column is already 1, so we need to add 4 more 1's. We fill the remaining empty cells in the same way as done for the second and third columns.\n\n[[1 0 0 0 1 , 0 1 0 1 1 , 0 1 1 0 0 , 1 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 0 0]]\n\nThis solution is aligned with the rules.

(1,1)(2,1):2÷ -> The numbers in this column (column 1) must sum up to 2. As the numbers 1 and 2 are the only ones that satisfy this condition, we have:\n\n   1 0 0 0\n   2 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0\n\n2. (3,3)(3,4):2÷ -> The numbers in this row (row 3) must sum up to 2.

(1,2)(1,3):1- -> The numbers in this row (row 1) must have a difference of 1.

(1,4)(2,4):8* -> The two numbers in these columns (columns 1 and 4) must multiply to 8. Since we have already used 2 in column 1, the pair of numbers (2,4) could go here. However, there's a conflict in column 4, so let's try (1,4):\n\n   2 1 0 1\n   2 0 0 0\n   1 0 1 0\n   0 0 0 0\n\n5. (2,2)(2,3):3* -> The two numbers in these columns (columns 2 and 3) must multiply to 3. The only possible pair is (1,3), but there's already a 3 in column 3. We shall switch the 3 and the 1 in previous step and place (3,1) here:\n\n   2 3 1 1\n   2 0 0 0\n   1 0 3 0\n   0 0 0 0\n\n6. (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ -> The four numbers in these positions must sum up to 13. Replacing the numbers and checking if it holds:\n\n   2 3 1 1\n   2 0 0 0\n   1 4 3 0\n   6 0 0 0\n\n7. (4,3)(4,4):2- -> The numbers in these columns (columns 3 and 4) must have a difference of 2. As 3 and 1 satisfies this condition, we have:\n\n   2 3 1 1\n   2 0 0 0\n   1 4 3 4\n   6 0 1 3\n\n8. Finally replace the 2s in the second row:\n\n   2 3 1 1\n   3 0 0 1\n   1 4 3 4\n   6 0 1 3\n\nSo the final grid, wrapped in [[ ]] as specified is:\n\n[[2 3 1 1,3 0 0 1,1 4 3 4,6 0 1 3]]"}

(1, 4) < (2, 4): The number in row 1, column 4 is less than the number in row 2, column 4.\n2. (2, 2) < (2, 3): The number in row 2, column 2 is less than the number in row 2, column 3.\n3. (3, 2) > (4, 2): The number in row 3, column 2 is greater than the number in row 4, column 2.\n4. (3, 1) > (3, 4): The number in row 3, column 1 is greater than the number in row 3, column 4.\n5. (3, 4) > (4, 4): The number in row 3, column 4 is greater than the number in row 4, column 4.\n\nSince there are only four elements provided in the grid, we can infer that we're working with a 4x4 grid. Using the rules and constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The fourth column tells us (1, 4) < (2, 4), so the numbers in the fourth column can be 1, 2, 3, with \"1\" being in the first row and \"3\" being in the second row, since we have no options to compare to the third and fourth rows yet. Therefore, the fourth column, so far would be 1, x, x, x, 3.\n- The fourth row constraint, (3, 4) > (4, 4) means the third row number in the fourth column needs to be higher than the fourth row number in the same column. Since we already have a 3 at the second row, we can assign only 4 to the fourth row, and since (3, 4) > (3, 1), we need numbers greater than 4 in the third row of the fourth column, so (3, 4) should be 5.\n- With only 1,3, and 5 used for fourth column, we have 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 to place in the remaining positions. We use the inequality (3, 2) > (4, 2) to give 4 to the third row of second column, and 5 for the fourth.\n\nThe final representation is:\n\n[[2 1 3 1],\n [x x x 3],\n [x 4 x 5],\n [x 5 x 4]]\n\nPlease note that there are multiple possibilities for the configuration of this 4x4 grid considering the open grid positions and constraints provided. This is just one potential configuration. Further inference is required to completely fill the grid with the remaining numbers.\n\nThis answer is presented in the format as shown [[2 1 3 1,x x x 3,x 4 x 5,x 5 x 4]]."}

Let's start with the first row. We have a \"greater than\" constraint at (1,2)>(1,3). So, the arrangements in row 1 can be either 2 3 1 or 3 2 1, but since 2 is already present at row 1 column-2, we must choose 3 2 1. Hence, our completed first row is 2 3 1 X.\n\nNow, let's fill row 2: The given constraint at (2,2)>(2,3) provides us with 2 1 3 for the second row. Thus, our completed second row becomes 3 2 1 4.\n\nMoving on to row 3: The constraint given at (3,1)<(3,2) gives us 1 2 X X, so we add the necessary remaining numbers to complete the row: 1 2 4 3.\n\nFinally, fill row 4: Since there are only two x's left and one of them must be equal to 3, as given in row 4 column 4, we place the numbers 4 1 2 3 to satisfy the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the solution matrix is:\n\n2 3 1 4\n3 2 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n4 1 2 3\n\nWrapping the matrix with double square brackets as per the example format:\n\n[[2 3 1 4, 3 2 1 4, 1 2 4 3, 4 1 2 3]]"}

A square with a number indicates how many mines surround that square. To do so, we will check each square with a number, and try to mark the surrounding mines first:\n\n1. Starting from top left, 2 is surrounded by X X.\n2. Moving down, 3 is surrounded by X X X.\n3. Next row, 3 is surrounded by X X X and one visible X.\n4. Moving to the next row, second 3 is surrounded by X X X and X.\n5. In the fourth row, we have 2 and 3. We already know that 3 has to be surrounded by at least two mines. The only place is at the bottom right corner.\n6. In the fifth row, 2 is surrounded by the mine in the bottom right corner from step 5, and another X.\n7. Besides the bottom right corner in the sixth row, 3 is also adjacent, so this X should be a mine.\n8. In the seventh row, second last 1 is surrounded by two mines already, one is the bottom right corner. Thus, the only other position that makes sense is the upper left X in the sixth row.\n9. Now we move back to the second row, start with the center X. It is surrounded by 1 mine. The upper X can only be covered by the mine in the second row, second left corner.\n10. For the third row, first and second X can be covered by the mine in the second row and the mine in the seventh row from step 8.\n11. For the fifth row, we find one mine left uncovered, which should be the leftmost X in the fifth row.\n12. For the seventh row, the X in the third row can be covered by the mine in the fifth row from step 11. The X in the second row can be covered by the mine in the third row from the same row.\n\nAfter this process, the mines positions have been determined:\n\nAllocated A's for mines: \n[[A, 3, A, A, 1, X, 1], \n[X, X, A, 3, X, 3, X], \n[2, X, A, X, X, 3, 1], \n[X, X, X, 3, X, 2, A], \n[X, 2, 3, X, 3, X, 1], \n[2, X, X, X, A, 3, X], \n[X, X, 2, X, X, 1, X]]\n\nAfter transforming X's to mines, the final answer is:\n\n[[A, 3, A, A, 1, A, 1], \n[A, A, A, 3, X, 3, X], \n[2, X, A, X, X, 3, 1], \n[X, X, X, 3, X, 2, A], \n[X, 2, 3, X, 3, X, 1], \n[2, X, X, X, A, 3, X], \n[X, X, 2, X, X, 1, X]]"}

There are two mines in the last row, one in the cell beneath (4,3), and one at the right side (3,4). Hence, the cells (3,3), (4,3), and (3,4) are mines.\n\nFrom the number 2 in cell (4,4), we have 2 mines. We have already identified the mine at (3,4). Hence, the remaining mine must be at (5,4).\n\nFrom the number 2 in cell (4,7), we have 2 mines. We already identified the mine at (4,3). Hence, the remaining mine must be in cell (5,7).\n\nFrom the number 3 in cell (5,5), we have 3 mines. We already identified mines at (4,4) and (5,7). Hence, the remaining mine must be at (6,5)\n\nFrom the number 2 in cell (7,6), we have 2 mines. We already identified the mine at (6,5). The remaining mine must be on the same row, at the cell (7,7).\n\nResulting Table:\n```\nX\t2\tX\t2\t1\tX\tX\nX\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n1\tX\tA\tA\tA\tX\tX\nX\t1\tX\tX\tA\tX\tA\n1\tX\tX\tA\tA\tA\tA\n1\t2\t2\tX\tX\tX\tA\nX\tX\tX\tX\tX\tA\tA\n```\n\nHence, the answer: [[X,2,X,2,1,X,X],[X,X,X,X,X,X,2],[1,X,A,A,A,X,X],[X,1,X,X,A,X,A],[1,X,X,A,A,A,A],[1,2,2,X,X,X,A],[X,X,X,X,X,A,A]] \n\nYou were correct.
