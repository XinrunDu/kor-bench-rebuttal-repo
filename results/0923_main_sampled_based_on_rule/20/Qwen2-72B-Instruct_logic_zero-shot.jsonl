Here, for p1 to be negated (~p1) and true (\u2713), p1 must be false (x). For p2 to make the \"and\" (p2) part true (\u2713), p2 must be true (\u2713).\n- Now, for ~p3 to be false (x), p3 must be true (\u2713).\n- The assignment where x|x|\u2713 will lead to the formula being false.\n\nTherefore, the falsity value is [[F:x|x|\u2713]].\n\n### Formula 2: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\n- The formula is formed as an 'and' operation.\n- For the formula to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- For (~p2||p3) to be false, both parts (~p2 and p3) must be false.\n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n  - For p3 to be false, p3 must be false.\n- For (p1=::>p2) to be false, p1 must be true (\u2713) and p2 must be false (x), which is not consistent with the assignment required by the first part.\n- Falsity assignments: Since (~p2||p3) requires p2 to be true and p3 to be false, but (p1=::>p2) cannot be false with these assignments, no single assignment can make the entire formula false.\n\nTherefore, falsity value for the given structure: [[F:None]]\n\n### Formula 3: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\n- The main connective here is '&', meaning both parts must be false for the entire formula to be false.\n- Consider (p1=::>p2): The conditional statement is false in only one case: p1 = 'True' (\u2713); p2 = 'False' (x).\n- Next, consider (~(~(p1&p3)||p1)):\n  - The leftmost part is a nested negation (~ (~ (~(p1&p3) || p1))). In order for it to be false (contribution to the overall falseness of the formula), ~(p1&p3)||p1 must be true.\n  - In the scenario to nullify (~(p1&p3)||p1), we need both ~(p1&p3) and p1 to be false.\n    - For ~(p1&p3) to be false, (p1&p3) must be true, requiring p1=\u2713 (True) and p3=\u2713 (True).\n    - This directly conflicts with our previous finding that p1 must be True to make the conditional (p1=::>p2) false, which implies the only assignment that makes (p1=::>p2) false makes another part of the formula True (p1=\u2713), causing the entire structure not to have a false assignment under the analyzed scenario.\n  \nTherefore, the falsity values identified are:\n[[F:x|x|\u2713]];[[F:None]];[[F:None]]."}

Since each logical expression represents a combination of truth and falsehood of the statements made by A, B, and C, we can use the basic equivalences and truth table analyses to simplify these expressions.\n\nLet's start by simplifying each of the six expressions (B1&C2&D3, B1&C3&D2, B2&C1&D3, B2&C3&D1, B3&C1&D2, B3&C2&D1) individually and then combine these to simplify the final expression E.\n\n### Simplifications:\n\n(1) **B1&C2&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD3 = q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = (!p & q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (5) and (9), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & r\n```\n(2) **B1&C3&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC3 = !p & q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = (!p & q) & (!p & q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nUsing (4), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!p & q) & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\n```\nUsing (3) and (8), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & 1 & 1\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q\n```\n(3) **B2&C1&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC1 = p & !q\nD3 = q & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (p & !q) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (9) and simplifying with the Absorption Law (7), we find that (p&q)&(p&!q) = 0, which simplifies the expression to:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = ((!p & !q) | (0)) & (q & r)\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q) & (q & r)\n```\nFrom here, using (4) (q & r implying q is true), we get:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q & q) & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = !p & r\n```\n(4) **B2&C3&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC3 = !p & q\nD1 = !q & !r\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (!p & q) & (!q & !r))\n```\nWe can immediately simplify (!p & q) with (!p & q), giving us:\n```\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (!p & q & (!q | q) & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 simplifies to (!p & q & 1 & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 = !p & q & !r\n```\n(5) **B3&C1&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC1 = p & !q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q) & (p & !q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nFrom here, the (p & !q) terms simplify and disappear via (1) and (3), leaving us:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n```\nUsing the Distributive Law (5), we get:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & !q & r) | (p & !q & q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & r) | (0)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & r\n```\n(6) **B3&C2&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD1 = !q & !r\nB3 & C2 & D1 = ((p & !q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (!q & !r)))\n```\nSince (p & !q) contradicts (p & q), leaving only the expression relating to (!p & !q):\n```\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (!p & !q & !q & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (0 & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = 0\n```\n### Simplifying E:\n\nGiven the simplifications above, the final logical expression E can be simplified to:\n```\nE = (!p & q & r) | (!p & q) | (!p & r) | (!p & q & !r) | (p & !q & r) | 0\n```\nWe can eliminate the 0 term as it does not contribute to the value of the expression. Simplifying further, we get:\n```\nE = !p & (q & r) | q | r | (q & !r) | (p & !q & r)\n```\nAgain, noting that if q or r is true, their corresponding conjunctions are automatically included, we can further simplify this expression, eliminating redundant terms:\n```\nE = !p & (q | r) | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nGiven either q or r is true (since the problem states exactly one of p,q,r is true), and one of p or !p must be true, we know q | r = 1 within the context of this truth space. Let's further simplify:\n```\nE = !p & 1 | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nFinally, simplifying E down purely with our truth values:\n```\nE = !p | p & (r & !q) | q | r\nE = (1 | q | r) & [(!p | r) & (!p | !q)]\n```\nBut given 1 is the universal truth value, the final simplification (considering idempotence, domination, and Absorption Law) would lead to:\n```\nE = 1\n```\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n```\n[\n[B1&C2&D3::=::!p & q & r];\n[B1&C3&D2::=::!p & q];\n[B2&C1&D3::=::!p & r];\n[B2&C3&D1::=::!p & q & !r];\n[B3&C1&D2::=::p & !q & r];\n[B3&C2&D1::=::0];\n[E::=::1]\n]\n```"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)V(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)V(p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(p\u2227q\u2227r) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given formula is a disjunction of conjunctive terms. Each conjunctive term is a conjunction of propositional variables or their negations, and all variables appear exactly once in each term. The terms are:\n- \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr\n- \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r\n- \u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 r\n- p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r\n- p \u2227 q \u2227 r\n\nThese terms are in lexicographical order and represent all possible truth assignments for p, q, and r. Therefore, they are paired conjunctive terms.\n\nNext, we determine the binary representation corresponding to the truth values of p, q, and r for each term:\n- \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr: 111 (binary representation for the false assignment of p, q, and r)\n- \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r: 110\n- \u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 r: 100\n- p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r: 010\n- p \u2227 q \u2227 r: 000\n\nThe binary numbers corresponding to these assignments in hexadecimal are:\n- 111: 7 (M7 as it's a negation)\n- 110: 6\n- 100: 4\n- 010: 2\n- 000: 0 (m0 since it includes false assignment for all variables)\n\nSince the formula is a disjunction of conjunctive terms and each paired conjunctive term corresponds to a unique truth assignment, it satisfies the conditions for the principal disjunctive normal form. The paired conjunctive terms included are m0, and the rest (which are not negations) correspond to the formula being an all-even formula except for m0.\n\nTherefore, the formula conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form. It includes all paired conjunctive terms, making it a tautology, and specifically, since it includes m0, it is also a basic formula. However, since the question does not ask about its type (tautology, basic, etc.), we will simply denote it as per the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nAnswer format: [[A]; [denoted expression]]\n\nThe denoted expression consists of all paired conjunctive terms included, which are m0, m2, m4, m6. We do not include M7 because it denotes the negated term that results in a false assignment.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n[[A]; [m0 + m2 + m4 + m6]]"}

The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x \u2014 \\(F_J(0, x)\\) \u2014 only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x \u2014 this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]"}

SAP\n- [2] All products are not qualified. This is not a proper form but can be translated to No products are qualified, SEP\n- [3] All products are not unqualified. This means all products are qualified, SAP\n- [4] Some products are unqualified. SOP\n\nThe relationship between [1] and [2] is not direct because [2] should be translated to a proper form (SEP) and then it would have a # relation with [1] (SAP), meaning if one is true, the other is false. However, since [2] is not properly formed, they don't have a relationship in the strictest interpretation of being completely identical, hence [B].\n\nThe relationship between [1] and [3] is direct because [3] means the same as [1] (All products are qualified). Therefore, they have a & relationship since switching from one to the other does not change the truth value. So, they have a relationship in this case, hence [A].\n\nThe relationship between [3] and [4] is direct as [3] asserts all products have a qualification, while [4] asserts some do not have this qualification (they are unqualified). These two statements are contradictory and have a * relationship (if one is true, the other must be false). Since the relationship question is asked under the condition of S and P being completely identical, and in this case, they are, the relationship holds, hence [B] would be not correct, but following given format and answers, it is noted as [B] given the strict interpretation that they must be identical in subject and predicate, which unqualified vs. qualified slightly alters despite being negations of each other. However, logically, they have a direct relationship based on the relationship types given."}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn two different regional health surveys, 90 out of 100 respondents in Region A and 75 out of 150 respondents in Region B reported exercising daily.\nPlease denote this symbolically by C-reasoning  rule.\n\nDenote the attribute daily running as S.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[C(S, 90/100, 75/150)] This symbolization denotes that there is a C-reasoning similarity in the proportions of daily exercising individuals between Region A and Region B. Therefore, the populations from which these regions are drawn are likely to have similar proportions of individuals who exercise daily."}
