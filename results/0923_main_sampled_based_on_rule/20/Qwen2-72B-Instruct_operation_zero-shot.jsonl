Compute 104※13:\n\nSince 104 is a multiple of 13, we use the rule for when a is a multiple of b (where a=104 and b=13), so:\n\n104※13 = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n2. Compute 19※28:\n\nSince 19 and 28 are neither multiples of each other nor can one divide the other evenly without a remainder, according to the rule:\n\n19※28 = 24.\n\n3. Compute 4※24:\n\nSince 4 does not divide 24 to a whole number nor is 24 a multiple of 4 (they do not fit our specific rule conditions), we follow the rule for when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a:\n\n4※24 = 24.\n\n4. Compute 24※24:\n\nSince 24 is a multiple of itself, but the rule only applies when one is the multiple of another, not the same number (rule is not explicitly clear on this scenario, but in the spirit of the rule, we can interpret that if a or b is not specifically a multiple of the other as described, 24 would apply):\n\n24※24 = 24.\n\nHere, as we see a conflict due to the exact interpretation of the rule regarding the same number being a multiple of itself (a common case not addressed by the rule exactly), we have applied the rule for when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a, assuming that this rule implicitly covers all cases not covered elsewhere, leading to our final answer calculation as:\n\nFinal operation: 24※(24) = 24.\n\nThus the final answer is [[24]]."}
