Here, neither 19 is a multiple of 28 nor 28 is a multiple of 19, so we apply the last part of our operation rule: if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, then a※b = 24. Thus, 19※28 = 24.\n\nNext, we evaluate \"4※104\". Here, not only is 4 not a multiple of 104 but also, no numbers are multiples of each other, so we again apply the last rule: 4※104 = 24.\n\nFinally, for \"24※13\", we see no multiples between 24 and 13, so we again apply the last rule: 24※13 = 24.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 19※28※4※(104※13) = 24※13 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer [[24]]."}
