To evaluate (3⊕4) and (7⊕2), we substitute these values into our operation rule, a⊕b=a+bi, so (3⊕4)=3+i4=3+4i and (7⊕2)=7+2i=7+2i. Then, (3⊕4)+(7⊕2)((3+4i)+(7+2i)), which equals 10+6i. Therefore, [[10+6i]].\n\n2. Again, we substitute (5⊕6)=5+6i and (3⊕1)=3+i into our operation rule. To compute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1), we first calculate 5*3=15 and 6*i*1*i=-6, so (5⊕6)×(3⊕1)=15+-6i=15-6i.\n\n3. We substitute (5⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. In this case, (5⊕3)=5+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (5⊕3)+(X⊕2)×3=11+11i, we first cancel out the X value, as X can vary. So we are left with (5⊕3)+(2i)×3=(5⊕3+a)×1=(5+ai)×1=11+11i. As (5⊕3)=5+3i, we subtract this from 11+11i, resulting in 11+11i-(5+3i)=6+8i. So, 6+3i (11+11i-(5+3i)) = a×1=6+8i. Hence, a=X=2.\n\n4. This is similar to the second question, so we substitute (6⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. Then, (6⊕3)=6+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (6⊕3)+(X⊕2)×2=10+11i, we first cancel out the X value: (6⊕3)+(2i)×2=(6⊕3+a)×1=(6+ai)×1=10+11i. By subtracting (6⊕3)=6+3i from 10+11i, we have 10+11i-(6+3i)=4+8i. So, 4+2i(10+11i-(6+3i)) = a×1=4+8i. Consequently, a=X=4."}
