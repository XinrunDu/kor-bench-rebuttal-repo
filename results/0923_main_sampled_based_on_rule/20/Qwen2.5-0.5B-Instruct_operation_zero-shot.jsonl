Calculate the first part: \\( 1^{\\sqrt{1}} \\). Since \\( 1 \\) raised to the power of \\( \\sqrt{1} \\) is \\( 1 \\), we have \\( 1^1 = 1 \\).\n\n2. Calculate the second part: \\( \\sqrt{1\\cdot\\sqrt{1}} \\). This further simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{1\\cdot 1} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\).\n\nSo, substituting back, we get:\n\n\\[ 1 + 1 = 3 \\]\n\nSince both parts equal \\( 3 \\) and since the indexing rule \\( a^b + \\sqrt{ab} \\) simplifies to a consistent value for any positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that make \\( a^b + \\sqrt{ab} \\) equal to 3, the answer is directly given by the rule.\n\nTile([[3]])"}
