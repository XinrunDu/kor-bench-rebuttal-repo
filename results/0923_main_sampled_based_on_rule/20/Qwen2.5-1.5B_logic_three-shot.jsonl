Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)?

If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A];[denoted:(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)V(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)V(p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(p\u2227q\u2227r)]]\n\nPlease note that the Z3BooleanLogic object has already been imported and defined with its primary function for bitwise operations, as per the given text."}

Symbolizing the given propositions (as provided):\n   - For \"(1) She completed her degree at a specific point in time\":\n     - We need a time representation in our rule system. Let's, for instance:\n       - Represent past time by symbols \"p.\"\n       - This proposition would thus become: \"Ap\"\n     - Clearly, let's also include timeless status in \"p\": \"p \u2208 Pr\", where Pr \u2284 (and not equal to) to P.\n   - For \"(2) They will move to a new house during a future period\":\n     - This proposition reflects a condition: \"going up\" in time within our terms, but we need a symbol to conceptualize progression. We may employ symbols \"G\" for \"future\" points in time.\n     - Thus the proposition can be: \"Gp\"\n    \n   Given the former (1), we have: \"Ap\" and \"#(resp.,)Gp\"\n    \n   Next task: Recognizing the relationships between propositions and their formalizations.\n\n#### Identifying Relationships Between Propositions\n\nLet's reorder some of the relationships we've discovered so far:\n\n- The \u00ab Relationship \u00bb.\n  - Pairs: Ap and H\u00acp; A\u00acp and Hp; Gp and F\u00acp; G\u00acp and Fp.\n- The \u00ab Inferencing Formulae \u00bb.\n\nSince the contextual rules for these covering arbitrary propositions didn't specifically outline a uniform terminology (p, G, or H from its imprimitiveness), we'd have to customize these phrases for each scenario. \n\n#### \"p\", \"**Simplified\" Acronyms** = \"HPSL\": \"Past Point of Time, Past period of Time\".\n\n- Then it is for instance (`p`), (not applicable nor useful in the current context).\n\nNow preserving the structure, summing up:\n\n- Map the Arithmetic Notation to Concrete PDE equations, which would look like: (Ap, Gp).\n - For the extraction of essential parts:\n   - Relationship for arrivals beyond \"ap\", forts beyond \"Hanp\", and its inherent color:\n     - Apr came before Hanp but here they'd coincide: \"H&#39;p\".\n   - \u2191Allows Forst \"> Apr from time HFsp \n\n- Apply \"XPath\" sources or the VoURL (just as discovered):\n\nFrom this context, recognize \"Aphorn\".\n\n**Simplified ForXPath**:\n\n- Aper project, thus the first common values:\n\n   The past entrance :\"Ap & NB\u03c6\".\n\n## Clearly, Goblin questions seeking a language, logic illustration or an extended epsecialization of logic.

The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
