Here's a detailed step-by-step analysis of the first given expression. I'll also provide a brief outline for verifying the second set of paired conjunctive terms.\n\n### First Expression: m0\u2228m8\u2228m2\u2228m10\u2228m6\u2228m4\u2228m3\u2228m11\n\n#### Step-by-Step Logical Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Basic Structure:**\n   - The expression includes all paired conjunctive terms from m0 to m11. This indicates that the expression is a tautology since it includes all possible pairs of propositional variables.\n\n2. **Truth Table Verification:**\n   - A simple way to verify this is to understand that the disjunctive normal form (DNF) provided includes all possible combinations of truth values for propositional variables. This means that for every possible assignment of truth values to the variables p, q, and r, at least one of the paired conjunctive terms will be true. Therefore, the entire expression is always true, or in other words, a tautology.\n\n#### Second Expression: m2\u2228m10\u2228m4\u2228m6 \u2227 m0\u2228m8\u2228m6\u2228m4\n\n1. **Simplifying Using Distribution Law:**\n   - Using the distribution law (A \u2228 B) \u2227 (A \u2228 C) = A \u2228 (B \u2227 C), we can simplify the given paired conjunctive terms.\n   - Here, m2\u2228m10 and m4\u2228m6 are in one part, and m0\u2228m8 are in another. This suggests a condition where at least one of the pairs (m2\u2228m10) and (m4\u2228m6) holds true, and both m0 and m8 are potentially considered.\n\n2. **Truth Table Verification for Simplification:**\n   - A truth table indicates there are some assignments where all paired conjunctive terms are not necessarily true or false. For example, consider an assignment that includes m0 and m4 which satisfies all. This is to identify if some terms may be redundant or included for expression verification purposes.\n\n3. **Further Simplification:**\n   - The logical simplification process indicates that further logical reasoning or simplification may yield a simpler equivalent expression. For instance, considering m0\u2228m6 which accommodates terms like m2\u2228m4\u2228m6\u2228m10\u2228m12, ensuring the essence of the pair's logical structure while checking if it's a contradiction or tautology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above and given specifications, the first expression m0\u2228m8\u2228m2\u2228m10\u2228m6\u2228m4\u2228m3\u2228m11 clearly corresponds to a tautology as it encompasses all possible paired conjunctive terms for three propositional variables.\n\nFor the second expression, a detailed logical simplification shows it also could turn into a form that may indicate a tautology or contradiction based on further logical simplification or insight needed. \n\nHowever, emphasizing careful examination through correct logical reasoning methods (like distribution, conjunction, and disjunction holds vital for solidifying equivalent logical pairs in normal forms) and understanding truth tables can significantly aid in simplifying logical expressions equivalently\u2014to verify these conclusions by ensuring logical consistency and completeness, as per the propagated knowledge in the example.\n\nThis problem is used in the DaCHS documentation, http://docs.g-vo.org/dachs/archive/coord.html."}

Therefore, they cannot be resolved.\n\n**Answer:** [[B]]\n\n#### Question 2:\n\"Calculate dispel(C1, C2) for C1 = p \u2228 \u00acq \u2228 r and C2 = \u00acp \u2228 q \u2228 \u00acr.\"\nTo resolve C1 and C2, we look for shared literals and their complements:\n- Common literals/complements: p, \u00acp; q, \u00acq\n- Resolving p and its complement \u00acp gives us the new clause containing q and remaining parts.\n- Similarly, resolving q and \u00acq gives us the new clause containing r and other parts\n\nResults from resolving possible pairs:\n- Including r and \u00acr as independent literals since neither directly resolve with p nor q when already considering the others.\n\n**Answer:** [[\u00acq\u2228r\u2228q\u2228\u00acr];[p\u2228r\u2228\u00acp\u2228\u00acr];[p\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acp\u2228q]]\n\n### Questions Analysis for Resolution Algorithm Application:\n\n#### Question 3:\nApply the resolution algorithm to :p^(\u00acp\u2228\u00acq)^q, and determine the outcome and cycle count.\n- This expression is a logical contradiction because it includes an element (p) and its negation (\u00acp) within the same conjunction.\n- The resolution process will identify this immediately in one cycle leading to output implausible.\n\n**Answer:** [[Implausible];[2]]\n\n#### Question 4:\nApply the resolution algorithm to p\u2227(p\u2228q)\u2227(p\u2228\u00acq)\u2227(q\u2228\u00acr)\u2227(q\u2228r), and determine the outcome and cycle count.\n- The contradiction in the expression arises due to (q\u2228\u00acr) and (q\u2228r) which cannot both hold true simultaneously under any circumstance. \n- Again, this contradiction would be discovered in immediate or subsequent cycles.\n\n**Answer:** [[Implausible];[1]]\n\n**Note:** These explanations adhere strictly to the given logic rules provided in your instruction list."}

Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Rewrite the given equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the identity for \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\):**\n   Recall that \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta} \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert from polar to Cartesian coordinates:**\n   We know that \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) and \\( \\cos \\theta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\), \\( \\sin \\theta = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\). However, to simplify our approach, let us express everything directly in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y/(r)}{x/(r) + 1}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2 r\n   \\]\n   Since \\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Further simplification:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\frac{y^2}{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2}\n   \\]\n\nThis transformation is quite complex to analyze further without numerical methods or graphing tools. However, based on the structure of the original polar equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), we recognize that this equation represents a type of conic section because it's similar to the polar equations of parabolas, hyperbolas, and other conics.\n\nGiven the form \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), it suggests that this is a variation of a hyperbolic shape due to the presence of \\( \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), which implies exponential growth as \\( \\theta \\) varies. This matches the characteristics of a standard hyperbola in polar form, where the distance from the pole to the curve increases exponentially with changes in angle.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe curve defined by the equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\) is a **hyperbola**. This conclusion comes from recognizing the typical behaviors and forms of such equations in polar coordinates, specifically their relationship to conic sections like hyperbolas.\n\nPolar Coordinates proof, why $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? I'm doing a problem below, but am having difficulty understanding this passage. From the geometry, why does it describe the second picture? Why does $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? \n\nProve that an ellipse and a hyperbola with the same foci must intersect at\nright angles.\n\nWe work in polar coordinates $(R, \\theta)$, with $O$ as the pole\nand the positive $x$-axis as the initial line, and by choosing a unit\nlength such that the foci are at equal distances from the origin.\n(Thus, the foci lie on the line $\\theta=\\pi$.) If $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the\neccentricities of the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively, then their\npolar equations have the form:\n     $$  r_1=e_1R(1- \\cos \\theta) \\ and \\ r_2=e_2R(1 + \\cos \\theta)$$\n     where $r_1, r_2$ are the distances of the corresponding points $P,\n     P'$ on the conics. Now the perpendicular distance from the center of\n     the hyperbola (which is the origin) to the tangent at $P'$ is given by\n     $r_2 \\sin \\theta$, and the perpendicular distance to the tangents at\n     $P$ by $r_1 \\sin \u03b8$. But the radii $OP$ and $OP'$ make equal angles of\n     $\\theta/2$ with $OP$, and thus the sum of the squares of the\n     perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to $OP^2+OP_2'=R^2$,\n     i.e.,\n$$(e_1R(1 - \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta+(e_2R(\n1 + \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta=R^2$$\nholds if and only if $e_1e_2 = 1$.\n\nTo understand why \\( R^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\) from the given geometry, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Setup and Definitions:**\n   - Let \\( O \\) be the origin.\n   - Let \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\) be the foci of the conics.\n   - The distance between the foci is \\( 2c \\).\n   - Let \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) be points on the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively.\n   - The distances from the origin to \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) are \\( R \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P \\) to the foci are \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_1' \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P' \\) to the foci are \\( r_2 \\) and \\( r_2' \\).\n\n2. **Polar Equations:**\n   - For the ellipse: \\( r_1 = e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\).\n   - For the hyperbola: \\( r_2 = e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\).\n\n3. **Tangents and Perpendicular Distances:**\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P' \\) is \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P \\) is \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\).\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - The radii \\( OP \\) and \\( OP' \\) make equal angles of \\( \\theta/2 \\) with the line \\( OP \\).\n   - The sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to \\( OP^2 + OP_2' = R^2 \\).\n\n5. **Derivation:**\n   - The perpendicular distances are \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The sum of their squares is:\n     \\[\n     (r_1 \\sin \\theta)^2 + (r_2 \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the expressions for \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2 + (e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R)^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + (e_2 R)^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta\n     \\]\n   - Factoring out \\( R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\left[ e_1^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 + e_2^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^"}

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
