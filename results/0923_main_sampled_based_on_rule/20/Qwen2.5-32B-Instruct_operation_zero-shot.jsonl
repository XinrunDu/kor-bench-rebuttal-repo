Given a◎b = (a + bi)^2, we can break down the problem into two parts as described in the equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i.\n\nLet's solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. Applying the operation definition to (3◎Y):\n\n   3◎Y = (3 + Yi)^2\n   = 3^2 + 2 * 3 * Yi + (Yi)^2\n   = 9 + 6Yi + Y^2i^2\n   = 9 + 6Yi - Y^2 (since i^2 = -1)\n   = (9 - Y^2) + 6Yi\n\n2. Applying the operation definition to (2◎1):\n\n   2◎1 = (2 + 1i)^2\n   = 2^2 + 2 * 2 * 1i + (1i)^2\n   = 4 + 4i + i^2\n   = 4 + 4i - 1 (since i^2 = -1)\n   = 3 + 4i\n\n3. Substitute these back into the equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i:\n\n   (9 - Y^2 + 6Yi) - (3 + 4i) = 5 + 2i\n   (9 - Y^2) + 6Yi - 3 - 4i = 5 + 2i\n   (9 - Y^2 - 3) + (6Y - 4)i = 5 + 2i\n   (6 - Y^2) + (6Y - 4)i = 5 + 2i\n\n4. From this, we separately match the real and imaginary parts:\n\n   6 - Y^2 = 5\n   6Y - 4 = 2\n\n5. Solve for Y:\n\n   For the real part: 6 - Y^2 = 5\n                     1 - Y^2 = 0\n                     Y^2 = 1\n                     Y = ±1\n\n   For the imaginary part: 6Y - 4 = 2\n                          6Y = 6\n                          Y = 1\n\nBoth parts of the equation are satisfied when Y = 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[1]]."}
