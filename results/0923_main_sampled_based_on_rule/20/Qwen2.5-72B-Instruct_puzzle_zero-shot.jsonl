Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each letter represents a unique digit.\n   - The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n   - The equation must balance: ONE + ONE + TWO = FOUR.\n\n2. **Analyze the equation:**\n   - Since we are adding two ONEs and one TWO, the sum must be a four-digit number (FOUR).\n\n3. **Start with the most significant digits:**\n   - The letter 'F' must be 1 because the sum of three numbers (ONE + ONE + TWO) cannot exceed 2997 (999 + 999 + 999), and the only way to get a four-digit number starting with 1 is if F = 1.\n\n4. **Determine the carry-over:**\n   - Since F = 1, there must be a carry-over from the hundreds place. This means that the sum of the hundreds place (O + O + T) plus any carry-over from the tens place must be at least 10.\n\n5. **Assign values to O and T:**\n   - Let's assume O = 5 (a common starting point for trial and error). Then 5 + 5 + T must be at least 10.\n   - 5 + 5 + T = 10 + carry-over from the tens place. This implies T = 0 (since 5 + 5 + 0 = 10).\n\n6. **Check the tens place:**\n   - The tens place equation is N + N + W + carry-over from the units place. Since O + O + T = 10, the carry-over to the tens place is 1.\n   - Therefore, N + N + W + 1 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the hundreds place carry-over), results in a number where the tens digit is 4 (since the hundreds digit of FOUR is 0).\n\n7. **Assign values to N and W:**\n   - Let's try N = 6. Then 6 + 6 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24 (since the carry-over to the hundreds place is 1).\n   - 6 + 6 + W + 1 = 13 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0 (since T is already 0).\n   - Let's try N = 7. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24.\n   - 7 + 7 + W + 1 = 15 implies W = 7, but N and W cannot be the same.\n   - Let's try N = 8. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 15.\n   - 8 + 8 + W + 1 = 17 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0.\n   - Let's try N = 9. Then 9 + 9 + W + 1 must be 19 or 29.\n   - 9 + 9 + W + 1 = 19 implies W = 1, but F is already 1.\n\n8. **Check the units place:**\n   - The units place equation is E + E + O + carry-over from the units place. Since O = 5, E + E + 5 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the tens place carry-over), results in a number where the units digit is 4 (since the units digit of FOUR is 4).\n   - 2E + 5 + 1 = 10 + 4 implies 2E + 6 = 10 + 4.\n   - 2E + 6 = 14 implies 2E = 8 implies E = 4.\n\n9. **Verify the solution:**\n   - ONE = 594\n   - ONE + ONE = 594 + 594 = 1188\n   - TWO = 085\n   - 1188 + 085 = 1273\n\nThe solution is:\n[[O=5, N=9, E=4, T=0, W=8, F=1, U=2, R=3]]"}

Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:**\n   - EAT is a three-digit number.\n   - THAT is a four-digit number.\n   - APPLE is a five-digit number.\n   - The sum of a three-digit number and a four-digit number results in a five-digit number.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equations:**\n   - EAT = 100E + 10A + T\n   - THAT = 1000T + 100H + 10A + T = 1001T + 100H + 10A\n   - APPLE = 10000A + 1000P + 100P + 10L + E = 10000A + 1000P + 100P + 10L + E\n\n3. **Equation:**\n   - EAT + THAT = APPLE\n   - 100E + 10A + T + 1001T + 100H + 10A = 10000A + 1000P + 100P + 10L + E\n   - Simplify: 100E + 1010A + 1002T + 100H = 10000A + 1100P + 10L + E\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - E, T, H, A, P, L are unique digits (0-9).\n   - E, T, A, P, L cannot be 0 (as they are the leading digits of multi-digit numbers).\n\n5. **Trial and Error with Logical Deductions:**\n   - Start by assigning values to the most significant digits and check the constraints.\n\n   Let's try:\n   - A = 1 (since it's the most significant digit in APPLE and EAT is a three-digit number)\n   - E = 9 (since it's the most significant digit in EAT and it should be large to balance the equation)\n\n   Now we have:\n   - 900 + 10A + T + 1001T + 100H + 10A = 10000 + 1100P + 10L + 9\n   - 900 + 20A + 1002T + 100H = 10009 + 1100P + 10L\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 900 + 20 + 1002T + 100H = 10009 + 1100P + 10L\n   - 920 + 1002T + 100H = 10009 + 1100P + 10L\n   - 1002T + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n\n6. **Further Simplification:**\n   - Let's try T = 8 (a large digit to contribute to the sum)\n\n   Now we have:\n   - 1002 * 8 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 8016 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 1073\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 107.3 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 7:\n   - 1002 * 7 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 7014 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 2075\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 207.5 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 9:\n   - 1002 * 9 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 9018 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 71\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 7.1 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 6:\n   - 1002 * 6 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 6012 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 3077\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 307.7 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 5:\n   - 1002 * 5 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 5010 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 4079\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 407.9 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 4:\n   - 1002 * 4 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 4008 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 5081\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 508.1 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 3:\n   - 1002 * 3 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 3006 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 6083\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 608.3 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 2:\n   - 1002 * 2 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 2004 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 7085\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 708.5 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   Let's try T = 1:\n   - 1002 * 1 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 1002 + 100H - 1100P - 10L = 9089\n   - 100H - 1100P - 10L = 8087\n\n   Simplify:\n   - 10H - 110P - L = 808.7 (not possible, so adjust T)\n\n   After many trials, we find:\n   - T = 1, H = 3, A = 1, P = 0, L = 9, E = 9\n\n   So the final solution is:\n  "}

The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction. Here’s how to approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - Each row and column must contain the numbers 1 through 5.\n   - The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate the number of visible skyscrapers from that direction.\n\n2. **Analyze the clues:**\n   - Top: 2, 2, 3, 2, 1\n   - Bottom: 2, 3, 1, 2, 3\n   - Left: 2, 4, 2, 1, 2\n   - Right: 1, 2, 2, 5, 3\n\n3. **Start filling the grid:**\n   - **Row 5:** The clue on the right is 5, which means all 5 skyscrapers are visible. This can only happen if the heights are in ascending order from left to right. Therefore, Row 5 must be: 1 2 3 4 5.\n   - **Row 5:** The clue on the top is 1, which means the tallest skyscraper is on the left. This is consistent with our previous fill.\n\n4. **Continue with the other rows and columns:**\n   - **Column 5:** The clue on the right for Row 1, 2, and 3 is 1, which means the tallest skyscraper is on the right. Therefore, the rightmost column must have the tallest skyscrapers in Rows 1, 2, and 3.\n   - **Row 1:** The clue on the left is 2, which means the first two skyscrapers are visible. The tallest skyscraper cannot be in the first position. Place 4 and 5 in the first two positions.\n\n5. **Fill the remaining cells:**\n   - Use the clues and the process of elimination to fill the remaining cells.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Row 5:**\n   - 1 2 3 4 5\n\n2. **Column 5:**\n   - 5\n   - 4\n   - 3\n   - 2\n   - 1\n\n3. **Row 1:**\n   - 3 4 5 1 2\n\n4. **Row 2:**\n   - 4 1 2 5 3\n\n5. **Row 3:**\n   - 2 5 1 3 4\n\n6. **Row 4:**\n   - 5 3 4 2 1\n\n7. **Row 1:**\n   - 2 3 4 1 5\n\n8. **Final grid:**\n   - 2 3 4 1 5\n   - 4 1 2 5 3\n   - 2 5 1 3 4\n   - 5 3 4 2 1\n   - 1 2 3 4 5\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[2 3 4 1 5, 4 1 2 5 3, 2 5 1 3 4, 5 3 4 2 1, 1 2 3 4 5]]"}
