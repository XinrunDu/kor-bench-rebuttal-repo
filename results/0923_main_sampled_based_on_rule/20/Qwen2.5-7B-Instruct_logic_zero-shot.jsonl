According to the inference formula (9) Ap \u2192 Hp, this leads to \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some point in the past\" which is represented as \"Hp\" (a past point in time). Therefore, only inference formula (9) corresponds to the given statement, but since the statement implies \"at some time\" which can be a period or a point, it should be interpreted as both (9) and (10) together. The correct interpretation is that the statement \"has been working\" can be seen as both a past period and a past point, thus aligning with two formulae. However, strictly following the direct inference, only one can be directly mapped, which is formula (9)."}

It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa.

For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All Chinese billionaires are Chinese people,\" so \"all Chinese people are Chinese billionaires.\" The premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
