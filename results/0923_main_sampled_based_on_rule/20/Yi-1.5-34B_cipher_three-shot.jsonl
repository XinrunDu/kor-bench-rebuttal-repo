When asked to the decryption funtions you can take the previous ciphertext and then decript the ciphertext because it is a chain. We do not deterministically know we are at the end of the chain, when refering to one of the previous ciphertexts. And if we try topars the ciphertext, as a single input response is going to be in the incorrect order (predicting the other persons assisstant, when there isn't one).\n\n## Dual Cipher:\n\n### Encription(multiple) + Decription(multiple):\n- You can chain encryption to create a hello scrambling.\n- Check the security used to have your encrypted answers are seen visually different each of the other.\n- You can chain decryption to decrypt the first encrypted result.\n\n### Question:\nBecause of the after effects of the merge of different algorithms, there are often deviations.\nIf the specific cipher that you want to crack at the en of the encryption funcies doesn't works, try this one:\nCipher: Vigénère (Polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher)\nkeystring: \"Kapital\"\nMod: 26\nPrint key\n"}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Your task is to compare the given cipher to the freemasons decoder in the example format provided below. The cipher rule is pasted at the bottom of this prompt.\n\nExample:\n\n### Cipher:\nAn example cipher.\n**Encryption Rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: A number from 0 to 25.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - To encrypt character into ciphertext, use the following rules:\n        - If the character is \"J\", which is equivalent to \"I\" in this cipher, replace it with \"I\" before continuing.\n        - Shift the character to the right by the key value (or to the left if going beyond Z).\n        - If the shifted character is \"I\", which is equivalent to \"J\" in this cipher, replace it with \"J\" as the final result.\n    - After processing all characters in the plaintext, connect the encrypted characters to form the ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Convert the ciphertext into a block of 5 characters, starting from the third character. For example, if the ciphertext is \"CIPHERCTEXT\", the first block is \"IPHCT\", the second block is \"EERCT\", and the third block is \"EXT\".\n    - Determine the first character in the current block. Find the corresponding top line in the image based on the position of the first character in the block.\n    - Move, one character at a time, down the top line to the intersection of the first column.\n    - Move to the right along the currently selected column until reaching the end. The last character before reaching it represents the plaintext character corresponding to the first character in the current ciphertext block.\n    - Copy the corresponding plaintext character and append it to the ongoing decrypted plaintext.\n    - Continue moving down the top left column, finding the second character in the current block. Move across the corresponding column to obtain the plaintext character corresponding to the second character in the current ciphertext block, and append it to the ongoing plaintext.\n    - Repeat this process for each character in the ciphertext block.\n    - After dealing with all characters in the current block, return to the starting point and deal with the characters of the next block.\n    - This process is repeated until the end of the ciphertext.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids:\n        \n        Grid0:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid1:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid2:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n        Grid3:\n        \n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        \n        Grid4:\n        \n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        \n        Grid5:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid6:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid7:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The plaintext is grouped into blocks of 5 characters, numbered from 0.\n    - For blocks of 5 characters:\n        - To use the grid is determined by calculating grid_index = (i // 5) % 8, where i is the number.

According to the rules you provided, the morse code is split into two pairs of characters. However, if the length of the morse code is odd, the last character, as is, is added to the ciphertext. During the decryption process, this rule should be applied inversely. Instead of splitting the morse code into two pairs of characters, the characters should be grouped in pairs from the right side, and the last character, if odd, should be added to the decrypted string without being processed. \n\nFor example, if the encrypted text is \"984\", it represents the morse code \"-/\" (1). During decryption, the morse code should be converted to a single character \"A\" instead of splitting it into pairs like \"--\". I have corrected the decryption process in the responses below:\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"984\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[GFKD]]\n\nCan you explain where my original reasoning went wrong and what should have been my correct logic in order to solve this?\nHindsite analysis of the AI's behaviour\nIt seems like GPT-3 ... was sloppy in recognizing the 43 and 984 responses, thereby deciding to lazily return A in both cases.\nGPT-3 could have been smarter and either decisioned that 43 and 984 aren't the same sequence (before even attempting to decrypt them as A) or it should have anticipated the \"D\" beforehand by recognizing that 43 and 984 aren't special cases when compared to the other two cases (779629 and 84), and rather than \"squeezing\" the 43 decryption A out, it should have instead decided that the question was asking a mistake to show, but not the mistake inducing input.\nSummarize (the full output of) the LLM to a single sentence and it's clear that it's made no effort to analyze the 43 case to a decryption of A, but has instead accumulated multiple styles of words and phrases in order to multisense my question with the same answer: A. On the surface level, the output of GPT-3 looks like a memory table, complete with the styles of words and phrases re-used multiple times, but gimics in the questions, which it's style does not & cannot change (i.e. how would a history textbook mention a same underlying topic different enough to not remember the word \"history\"?).\nFWIW a search for \"summary: ...AI ceases to contradict itself after fixing its logic\" on twitter appears to return mostly bad candidate programs posing as AI, or malicious use of the AI (prompt injection (if it works, or worse, if it becomes aware of posing as Cary), abuse of common patterns in the AI's output such as common phrases copypastad (or 1-sentence summaries of & quotes from the full output), and malicious \"prompt\"ing of the AI). With ChatGTP, to offer a non-malicious example, here the photographs are cherry-picked (judging from the copyright year, likely not cherry-picked out of the UI, but cherry-picked afterwards) in the viewing search; btw. its starting point had a filename starting with ChatGPT.txt - even with how the above post's by MateoChoqueChatgpt is rejected by the UI as a bad choice of keyword search query (see larger section below since the non-understanding AI \"user\" interjected into the UI's search, which really should have stopped sending image previews to ChatGPT as an option to preview.)\n\nThe meta answer/REALLY the first question is why/did the AI pick up the changes as a \"memory\" rather than accept the changes as improvements. The rest of the question here will cover this decision vs. heuristics such as (the order-of (branching-out of)) time, order-of-magnitude (effectiveness), and recall/repetition familiarity. The text of the factual answer will likely end up being short as compared to the explanation; not GPT's style at all (i.e. classic complaints about wikipedia's accuracy/vulgarity [a systematic lack of understanding the context of what's being written]).\n"}

Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Grid2. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad. For example, the ternary (4,1,5), the row number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L1_row=0, the column number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L2_col=0, L1_col=4, L2_row=5, according to (0,4) in Grid1, we find The corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Grid2, we decode all the ternary to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after the ternary is decoded. We find the corresponding letter H in Grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH. Join all the decrypted message strings together, and remove the # at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.

(Even when its trying to do Language Modeling, it does it literally)\nYou are querying the LLM with code, so its output is code, something that encodes something which it can not process normally, text. What you didn't tell the LLM is that it has to output text, but it has 'no formatting' specified, so... recursion.\nNow the odd part is that if it does NOT get formatted, (or once its recursed through once, or reaches some recursion limit) it trends around again, and it ends up readable. However its still +50% higher sampled than the normal soln, which isn't saying too much, but not good.\nChatGPT and other LLMs are code Arithmetic Machine/Ops, aka they are sums of probabilistic modelled probabilities of convergence on semantics, but they are still real computers, once you interact with them in a specific way it becomes undefined, infinitely complicates itself, fragments, or becomes one syllable. Take away saving your model output, and it becomes a sample of noise, the giants I like to call them, furiously modelling something we wont see, more complex samples, like having your distributed cache play around with RPC responder distribution algorithms for a hour.\nSo in general when something does that, you change the path, branch, or appease the infinite summation, keep exploring relevant.\nTLDR: LLMs are powerful self-modelling arithmetic cores, the closer you get to the convolutions the closer you get to whatever distribution led to the density of dense responses you've seen, change your input format, stay as high abstraction as possible, and try to keep a routing/distributed computing perspective outside of the LLM.\n"}

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Calculate x * k_q_x as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Compute z = c // k_q_x. where // is used in integer division operations to return the integer part of the quotient (i.e., the result of removing the fractional part).\n        - Based on the decimal number represented by z, use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
