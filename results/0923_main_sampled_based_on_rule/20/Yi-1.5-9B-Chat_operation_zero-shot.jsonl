Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na◎b=(a + bi)^2\n\n### Question:\nIf (6◎3)+(X◎2)×2=37+60i, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's apply the operation rule to the given equation step by step.\n\nGiven equation: (6 ◎3 )+(X◎2 )×2 =37 +60 i\n\n1. Calculate (6 ◎3 ):\n\\[\n6\\,◎3 = (6 + 3i)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= (6 + 3i)(6 + 3i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 36 + 18i + 18i + 9i^2\n\\]\nGiven that \\(i^2 = -1\\), we replace \\(i^2\\) with \\(-1\\):\n\\[\n= 36 + 36i - 9\n\\]\n\\[\n= 27 + 36i\n\\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(X\\,◎2\\):\n\\[\nX\\,◎2 = (X + 2i)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= (X + 2i)(X + 2i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= X^2 + 4Xi + 4i^2\n\\]\nAgain, replacing \\(i^2\\) with \\(-1\\), we get:\n\\[\n= X^2 + 4Xi - 4\n\\]\n\\[\n= X^2 + 4Xi - 4\n\\]\n\n3. Substitute these into the original equation:\n\\[\n27 + 36i + 2(X^2 + 4Xi - 4) = 37 + 60i\n\\]\nExpanding the multiplication:\n\\[\n27 + 36i + 2X^2 + 8Xi - 8 = 37 + 60i\n\\]\n\n4. Arrange like terms:\n\\[\n2X^2 + 8Xi + 19 + 36i = 37 + 60i\n\\]\n\\[\n2X^2 + 8Xi + 19 - 37 - 36i + 60i = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2X^2 + 8Xi + 24i - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\n5. Separate the real and complex parts:\nReal part: \\(2X^2 - 18 = 0\\)\nImaginary part: \\(8Xi + 24i = 0\\)\n\n6. Solve for the real part to find \\(X^2\\):\n\\[\n2X^2 - 18 = 0 \\implies 2X^2 = 18 \\implies X^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n7. Since we are asked for a number and knowing that \\(X^2 = 9\\) directly gives us the real solution for \\(X\\), we find:\n\\[\nX = \\pm3\n\\]\n\nGiven the instruction to provide the answer as a number, both +3 and -3 are valid, as they are both numbers. However, to conform to a typical single-valued response format, if we are to choose one, it would be based on the context or additional constraints not directly provided in the question. Without such context, both answers are correct based on the calculation.\n\nTherefore, both [[+3]] and [[-3]] are valid answers based on the calculation, assuming we are looking for real values of \\(X\\) as specified by the operation rule and the requirement to provide a single numerical answer."}
