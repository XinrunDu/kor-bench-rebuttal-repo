Specifically, the statement that its relationship is either universal or particular, and that the relationship is either an affirmative or negative.\n\nAssume an object is A,X,B,Y,C, etc. If a contained object X in the A group has a certain relation Q and contains a certain property P with Y, a connection C is connected, resulting in the proposition of molecular statements.\n\nThe four basic types are as follows:\n- Universal Affirmative Molecular Statement (UMAS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q and possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as APB, also known as Affirmative Molecular Statement (AMS), abbreviated as AMA.\n- Universal Negative Molecular Statement (UNS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q but do not possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as ASPB, also known as Negative Molecular Statement (NMS, Number), abbreviated as ANM.\n- Particular Affirmative Molecular Statement (PNS): Some A and X in the A group have the relationship Q with B and Y in the whole B group, share the state-related property P, and asserted.\n- Particular Negative Molecular Statement (PSM): Some A and X in the group A have the relationship Q, but they do not share the state property P with B and Y in the group B.\n\n### For example:\n- All A and B are composed of C and H.\n- Every earthly object is made from atoms.\n\nRefer to the above example on how to conduct a philosophical analysis.\n\n### Question:\nAnalyze the following statement.\n\"All adults over 25 years old have a university degree.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[+/Men/University]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Men]]\n\n### Question:\nProfessor A said: \"All dogs are living things.\"\nProfessor B said: \"No cats are living things.\"\nProfessor C said: \"There are both cats and dogs that live on the earth.\"\n\nChoose these three phrases carefully from the following category.\n- Animals that are dogs as well as living things.\n- Animals that are not cats and are living things.\n- There are animals that are called dogs, cats, and living things.\n\nWhat is Professor B's choice?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nShoes for playing sports and shoes for running are distinct:\n- Any tennis shoe is a sports shoe, but not all sports shoes are tennis shoes.\n- All running shoes are sports shoes, but not all sports shoes are running shoes.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[], []].\n\n### Answer:\n[[sports/_],[sports/_]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"If everything sent by cats is heated by fire, then everything sent by pigs is not heated by fire.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular statement does this claim constitute?\n\"I agree with A, and everyone who agrees with A dissociates from B.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of categorical proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Her performance was either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/E/I/O]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Beauty is either an external broadness or an inner broadness.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Instructions:\n1.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nConditional Claim:\nA categorical claim that is structured in a unique way. \nIt asserts that a specific relationship exists among the subject, the predicate, and the term that serves as the contrapostulate. The relationship can be either affirmative or negative.\n\nConditional proposition of the affirmative relationship (AC): The knowledge that if all subjects possess a certain predicate, they must respectively possess a certain contrapostulate. Its abbreviation is ARBQ, also known as an affirmative conditional proposition or bi-thesis proposition.\n\nConditional proposition of the negative relationship (NC): The knowledge that if no subject possesses a certain predicate, then all subjects must respectively possess the opposite of the subject. Its abbreviation is ARB\u00afQ, also known as a negative conditional proposition or anti-disjunction proposition.\n\nUsing English for example:\n- If anything admits of quantity, it must be an accident.\n- If anything is a proper name, then there are plenty of words that do not occur in it at all.\n\nHere are some common exam questions:\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- The Kings of England. If there are kings in England, no one can depose or dethrone them.\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- Owlish faces. Beakers are tall, clear, and narrow. If a face is owlish then it is always beaker-shaped.\n- External relations: All coins are money. If anything is money, the constable can take it away.\n- External relations: According to traditional logic, all gnomes are machines. If there is a mechanical environment, then there are undoubtedly gnomes in it.\n\nCategorize them according to your ability in conjunction with the standardization.\n\n### Question:\nMy brother, for example, always loves to read.
