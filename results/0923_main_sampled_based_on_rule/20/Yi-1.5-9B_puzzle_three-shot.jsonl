Here are some whole numbers that are not factors of 24: -1, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199, 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 225, 227, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253, 255, 257, 259, 261, 263, 265, 267, 269, 271, 273, 275, 277, 279, 281, 283, 285, 287, 289, 291, 293, 295, 297, 299, 301, 303, 305, 307, 309, 311, 313, 315, 317, 319, 321, 323, 325, 327, 329, 331, 333, 335, 337, 339, 341, 343, 345, 347, 349, 351, 353, 355, 357, 359, 361, 363, 365, 367, 369, 371, 373, 375, 377, 379, 381, 383, 385, 387, 389, 391, 393, 395, 397, 399, 401, 403, 405, 407, 409, 411, 413, 415, 417, 419, 421, 423, 425, 427, 429, 431, 433, 435, 437, 439, 441, 443, 445, 447, 449, 451, 453, 455, 457, 459, 461, 463, 465, 467, 469, 471, 473, 475, 477, 479, 481, 483, 485, 487, 489, 491, 493, 495, 497, 499, 501, 503, 505, 507, 509, 511, 513, 515, 517, 519, 521, 523, 525, 527, 529, 531, 533, 535, 537, 539, 541, 543, 545, 547, 549, 5"}

The rule should give arrow direction as a variable quantity, like '8', or 'directionx'.

The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the problem. This is possible, not because of the huge size of the grid, but because it directly contradicts a fundamental requirement of the Sudoku-like logic grid described in the rule. A Sudoku-like logic grid requires that the same domain cannot appear more than once in a range a 2x2 matrix. [Namely, a (i*i) cell do. The rules do not mind such a check and would hence allow a simple 2x2 matrix consisting of the domain values a and b to be valid, whereas a 5x5 matrix could contain twice such a 2x2 matrix which would validate where a 2x2 matrix for itself wouldn't be allowed.]\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question in this case is not solvable. The main problem is that the tables reference the letters as regions, while the pencil marks vanish the division into regions and make illegal positions in each region probable.\n\n### Question:\nCS(2)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the  information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the puzzle. The valid solution would be\n\nenclosed in double square brackets, like this: [[(1,2)(1,3),(2,4)(3,4)]].\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided.

The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the problem. This is possible not because of the huge size of the grid, but thanks to a requirement dating back to traditional Sudoku structures. [In the classical Sudoku-like logic grid, i.e. regions with values in various segments of cells, cells have to contain a unique value and the values need to be the same across all of the cells in the same region, thus providing unique  diagonally located values in the middle of the final grid for all the transition blocks.]"}
