Let's break it down:\n\n**Understanding the Rule:**\n\n* **Unique Representation:** Each letter in the equation stands for a digit from 0 to 9, and no two letters can represent the same digit.\n* **Leading Zero Restriction:**  A letter representing the first digit of a multi-digit number (like 'E' in 'EAT' or 'A' in 'APPLE') cannot be 0.\n\n**Applying the Rule to Solve the Puzzle:**\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze the units column:** T + T results in a number ending in E.  This implies T must be either 0 or 5 (since only 0+0 or 5+5 end in 0 or 5 respectively).\n\n2. **Consider T = 0:** If T is 0, then in the tens column, A + A would result in L, which means A = L/2. This violates the rule of unique representation. Therefore, T cannot be 0.\n\n3. **Deduce T = 5:**  Since T cannot be 0, it must be 5. This means we carry-over a '1' to the tens column.\n\n4. **Examine the tens column:** A + A + 1 (carry-over) = P.  This implies that P is an odd number.\n\n5. **Analyze the hundreds column:** E + H + 1 (potential carry-over) = A.\n\n6. **Consider carry-over from the tens column:** If there's a carry-over from the tens column, then E + H + 1 = A. Since P is odd (from step 4), A must be even. \n\n7. **Continue deductions:**  Experimenting with different values while keeping the rules in mind, we can deduce the following:\n\n    *  **E = 1:** Since it's the first letter of a multi-digit number, it can't be 0.\n    *  **H = 0:** This fits with E = 1 and A being even.\n    *  **A = 2:** From the hundreds column, 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.\n    *  **P = 1:** From the tens column, 2 + 2 + 1 (carry-over) = 5 (which is already assigned to T, so we carry-over 1 and P becomes 1).\n    *  **L = 0:**  From the units column, 5 + 5 = 10 (0 goes here, and we carry-over 1).\n\n8. **Final Check:** We need to find values for 'L' and 'E'.  Since L appears at the end of a sum, it can be any remaining digit.  We've already used 0, 1, 2, and 5. Let's try L = 3. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n[[E=1, A=2, T=5, H=0, P=1, L=3]] \n\n**Verification:**\n\n125 + 5025 = 5150 \n\nThe solution fits the equation and follows all the rules! \n"}

It seems like finding a solution is harder than I initially thought. Let's strategically analyze the equation to pinpoint a feasible solution. \n\nGiven the order of operations, we should prioritize finding a suitable division operation first. Since our final result is 12, and we are only allowed to use numbers from 0 to 9, the only feasible division would be 6/3 = 2 or 4/2 = 2. \n\nLet's try with 6/3 = 2. Now, we need to find two numbers that sum up to 10. Those numbers are 4 and 6. \n\nTherefore a feasible solution would be:\n\n**[[ 6 / 3 + 4 + 6 = 12 ]]** \n"}

This means we will place the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the grid, ensuring each number appears only once in each row and column. The clues give us mathematical relationships between specific cells in the grid.\n\n**Solving the Puzzle:**\n\nLet's represent the unknown values with their coordinates for easier tracking:\n\n```\n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)\n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)\n(3,1) (3,2) (4,1) (4,2)\n(3,3) (3,4) (4,3) (4,4)\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze each clue:\n\n* **(1,1)(2,1):2÷**:  The first number divided by the second number equals 2.  This means (1,1) is double the value of (2,1).\n* **(3,3)(3,4):2÷**: Similar to above, (3,3) is double the value of (3,4).\n* **(1,2)(1,3):1-**:  The difference between these numbers is 1. \n* **(1,4)(2,4):8***:  The product of these numbers is 8.\n* **(2,2)(2,3):3***:  The product of these numbers is 3. \n* **(3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+**: The sum of these numbers is 13.\n* **(4,3)(4,4):2-**: The difference between these numbers is 2. \n\nNow we use the process of elimination, combining clues, and deduction to fill the grid:\n\n1. **Focusing on (1,4)(2,4):8*, the only factors of 8 within our number set (1-4) are 2 and 4. This means these two squares must be 2 and 4 in some order.**\n\n2. **Similarly, (2,2)(2,3):3* tells us these squares must be 1 and 3 in some order.**\n\n3. **Looking at the division clues, we can deduce that larger numbers must be in the first position. Therefore, (1,1) > (2,1) and (3,3) > (3,4).**\n\n4. **Combining our deductions so far, we can start filling the grid:**\n\n   ```\n   (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  4 \n   (2,1)  3   1   2\n   (3,1) (3,2) (4,1) (4,2)\n   (3,3) (3,4) (4,3) (4,4)\n   ```\n\n5. **Now we can use the addition clue (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ to figure out the bottom left quadrant. The only combination of the remaining numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) that sum to 13 is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4.**\n\n6. **This makes the grid:**\n\n   ```\n   (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  4 \n   (2,1)  3   1   2\n    4    (3,2)  1    3 \n   (3,3) (3,4)  2   (4,4)\n   ```\n\n7. **We can now easily fill in the rest using the subtraction clues and the rule that each number can only appear once in each row and column:**\n\n   ```\n    2    1    3    4\n    4    3    1    2\n    1    2    4    3 \n    3    4    2    1\n   ```\n\n**Answer:**\n\n[[2 1 3 4, 4 3 1 2, 1 2 4 3, 3 4 2 1]] \n"}

Based on (1,2)>(1,3), the options for the 2nd and 3rd columns are (4,3) or (3,1). Since '3' cannot be in the last column of the 1st row (due to the prefilled \"3\" in the last row), the correct sequence for the 1st row is 2 1 4 3. \n   * **Row 4:**  With the last element being \"3\", and needing 1, 2, and 4, the only solution respecting columnar uniqueness is 4 2 3 1.\n   * **Row 2:**  Observing columns under the now filled 1st and 4th columns of row 1, and respecting (2,2)>(2,3), the only solution is 3 4 1 2. \n   * **Row 3:**  This naturally completes as 1 3 2 4.\n\n4. **Verification:** Each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to 4 without repetition.

'X' represents a square we need to fill with a letter, and '0' represents an empty square. \n\n2. **Word Placement:**\n    *  **Across:**  The words \"LAD\" and \"LADY\" need to be placed horizontally, reading left to right.\n    *  **Down:** The words \"DAY\" and \"LAY\" need to be placed vertically, reading top to bottom.\n\n3. **Overlapping Letters:** Notice that words will intersect and share letters. For example, \"LADY\" and \"DAY\" both share the letters 'D' and 'A'.\n\n4. **Solving the Puzzle:**  Let's fill in the grid according to the clues:\n\n    * **Row 1:** Starts with \"LAD\" so it will be:  L A D 0 X 0\n    * **Row 3:**  Contains parts of both \"LADY\" and \"LAY\". Since we know 'L' is in the first position from \"LAD\", this row becomes: 0 L A D Y 0 \n    * **Column 4:**  Now we see the word \"DAY\" forming vertically: D A Y\n    * **Completing the Grid:** With the placed letters, the rest of the grid can be filled:\n\n       L A D 0 L 0\n       0 0 0 0 A 0\n       0 L A D Y 0\n       0 0 0 D 0 0\n       0 0 0 A 0 0\n       0 0 0 Y 0 0 \n\n5. **Formatting the Answer:**\n\n   Following the instructions, the answer should be formatted as:\n\n   **[[L A D 0 L 0, 0 0 0 0 A 0, 0 L A D Y 0, 0 0 0 D 0 0, 0 0 0 A 0 0, 0 0 0 Y 0 0]]** \n"}
