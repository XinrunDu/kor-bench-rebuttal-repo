Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the new definitions of operations introduced in the abstract.\n2. Apply the rule to solve the question accurately.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it is correct.\"\n\n### Operation Rule:\nSpecify an operation called _dot: a■b = \\dfrac{a + b}{2}, where a and b are rational numbers.\n\n### Question:\nFind the value of (2022■1011)\\_.\n\n(10.11) = ??First is use \" = \"  not  \"_\"；use \"/\" instead of \";\". Second, A dot before bracket, use escape char '\\\\'.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1516.5]]\n\nanswer:1516.5\nHow would you find the answer? Notice that a\\\\mathbf{■}b = (a + b)/2\".\nMoreover, 2022 = 1011 * 2.\nWe have derived 2022\\\\mathbf{■}1011 = (1011 + 2022)/2 = (1011 + 2 * 1011) / 2 = 1516.5.\n\nNow, if given a new IF THEN statement:\nIf you performed online shopping for \\$500 through a certain bank’s credit card, \nthen this IF THEN statement helps you spend \\$2000 with only net spending of \\$500. \nYou can simply purchase 4 \\$500 online shopping credit card offers. \n\nThe 4x\\$500 still cost only \\$500, and then you receive 4x\\$2000 airfare credit, \nso your net spending is still \\$500, but you have \\$8000 airfare credit \nwhich you can use to purchase \\$8000 worth of airfare.\n\nNow, suppose the bank changes the IF THEN statement to the following:\nIf you performed online shopping for \\$500 through a certain bank’s credit card, \nthen you receive \\$2000 airfare credit. \nHowever, to receive the \\$2000 airfare credit, \nyou need to spend at least \\$2000 for airfare from the same bank’s credit card.\n\nNow, another customer finds a loophole to the new IF THEN statement: \nYou simply purchase \\$3000 worth of airfare, and then obtain \\$3000 /\\$500 = 6 \n\\$500 online shopping credit card offers. \n\nThe 6x\\$500 still cost only \\$500, and then you receive 6x\\$2000 airfare credit. \nSince you have already spent \\$3000 airfare, and received \\$12000 air credit, \nyou simply use \\$3000 air credit to clear the \\$3000 airfare you have already bought, \nand you are left with still \\$9000 air credit at no cost.\n\n# This example is the bank's mistake, leaving a loop hole for customers to take advantage of, it is not a suggestion to \"fix\".  This example is used so the AI assistant can understand the concept, then it may use the same concept later.\n\nNow, in your code, you need to define the function similar_terms(terms) that takes a String[] argument that may contain inequalities using the same variable, and your program need to find out if these inequalities have loophole that can be explored similarly to the above examples, and return true otherwise false.\nFor example, if the argument is\n{\"a\\\\ge b\", \"b\\\\ge 1\", \"b\\\\ge a*2/3\"}\nthen your function should return true, because one can multiply the second and third inequalities to obtain b^2\\\\ge 2a/3. \nPlugging this into the first inequality, we have a\\\\ge 2a/3, \nso we have found the loophole since we can reach the conclusion a\\\\ge 2a/3. \n(The inputs always has integer coefficients for all inequalities, but floating point values are acceptable in the output)\n\nSome other examples:\nInput:\tOutput:\n{\"c\\\\le d\\\\times 10^6\", \"d\\\\le c\\\\times 10^3\"}\tfalse\n{\"100\\\\le a\", \"a\\\\le 50\\\\times b\\\\times c\", \"b\\\\le c\\\\times d\", \"c\\\\le 10\\\\times b\", \"d\\\\le 10\", \"b\\\\ge 2\"}\ttrue\n{\"a\\\\le b\", \"b\\\\le c\", \"c\\\\le 1000\", \"c\\\\ge 500\"}\tfalse #if c=750 then a\\\\le 750 and 750\\\\le b.\n\ntips: First eliminate any variables which is bounded from both ends,\nlike in the second example, c must be between 0 and 10 so just plug in c=5 throughout, \nand now the inequality system becomes \n{\"100\\\\le a\", \"a\\\\le 50\\\\times b\\\\times 5\", \"5\\\\le b\\\\times d\", \"5\\\\le 10\\\\times b\", \"d\\\\le 10\", \"b\\\\ge 2\"} \nThe next variable to be eliminated is d, and so on.\n\nRemember to include both the inequality in Arr as well as the middle term you derived (example above is 2*a/3), \nso in the example given the inequalities are\na\\\\ge b, b\\\\ge 1, b\\\\ge a*2/3, 2/3\\\\times a\\\\ge b, together with the inequality 9/4\\\\times a\\\\ge a, \nyou derived the loophole.\nThe above\\\n1\n\n### Answer:\n[[true]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\le b\", \"a\\\\le b+c\", \"c\\\\le d\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[false]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\ge 0\", \"b\\\\ge a+1\", \"b\\\\le 2\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[true]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\ge b\", \"b\\\\ge 1\", \"c\\\\ge a/3\", \"c\\\\le 25\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[false]]"}

To find the number of bacteria in that solution, the sample needs to be subjected to several chemical analyses and filters. Each chemical analysis and filter has an efficiency rating.\n\nEach of the tests will have a maximum efficiency of $99999999999 which means that after each chemical analysis and filter, a maximum of $99999999999 per test of bacteria will be removed.\n\nThe efficiency of the equipment will decrease as the number of bacteria in the fluid decreases. Therefore, the contaminated fluid will need to be subjected to granular analysis.\n\nIf the quantity of bacteria in a sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{32768}{1}$ or $\\frac{1024}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\n\nFor example, if the analysis needs to be performed on the first most contaminated sample, which has $999999999$ bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $2024578745=999999999\\times 1$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $99999999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $99999999=128\\times\\frac{128}{9}$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $9999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $9999=256\\times \\frac{11}{256}$.\n\nDue to the fact that each piece of equipment is very delicate and expensive, only the minimum analysis procedure will be done to find the result. Therefore, find the maximum quantity of bacteria per sample based on the analysis procedure to have the exact number of bacteria.

Please summarize them into two parts.\n\n# Start the advance survey.\nNow let us do a survey process to better understand the questioner’s proficiency in solving problems with this type of new operator.\nThis section contains a number of requirements for us to investigate:\nformal language\nknowledge\nreasoning\nmodeling\nAbstraction\nMetrics\n\nNow let's first target the \"formal language and knowledge\".\nCan you give one example for this question?\n\n# solve basic problem\n\n# summarize again\n\n# start the final survey\nAdvanced Research Refining,\nlet's do some advanced research refining for the “formal language and knowledge” aspect；\nPlease pick one example to refine, the example is；\nr42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?\n \n# give the question\nNow go back to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nCan you answer this?\nHow would you describe the process?\n\nWould you like me to write a report for my answer?\n\nI would say “yes” to write a report.\nFirst of all, can you give a summary for the requirements from perspective A?\n\nNow summarize the requirements from perspective B.\n\n# give me my task, not the solution and explanation.\nThe whole process is divided into two parts.Part A is to introduce or build the formal problem and part B is to evaluate the problem directly and determine whether the problem has followed the formal problem requirements. The purpose of this exercise was to train me in different ways to answer the problems following the principles of the formal requirement.\nSo during the whole process, there are another two perspectives that I need to ask your help to check and organize.\nPerspective C focuses on evaluating the correctness of the solution of the questioner, to see whether the solution follows the requirements and the rule. For perspective C, you are expected to evaluate the correctness from the perspective of both aspects and give an overall evaluation for it. You should assess the solution using a score from 0 to 100, with a total of 50 points for each aspect. You should always provide the numeric score and an explanation, even if you explicitly say ‘no’, ‘not mentioned’, or ‘not mentioned’ explicitly.\nPerspective D focuses on evaluating the evolution process of my problem-solving strategies. Specifically, based on the problem description and my solutions, analyze my decision-making and finally give me a rating for the overall thinking process. For perspective D, should use conflicting contrast methods to evaluate the evolution process. That means, for each sub-question, start by assuming that my thinking process is correct and evaluate the thinking of the sub-question as a whole. Then, assuming that my thinking is wrong, evaluate the thinking of this sub-question as a whole. Two evaluations, one for each correct and incorrect assumption, are distinguished by points. For example, 34.5/100 65.5/100 means that the 'correct' thinking score is 34.5 and the 'incorrect' thinking score is 65.5. For cases that cannot be distinguished, use '/' to emphasize the confusion. Even if you say ‘no’, ‘no mention’ or ‘obvious’ explicitly, you should always provide the score and an explanation.\n\nNow let us go to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nFirst, can you answer this question?[[New operation r42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?]]\n\nSecond, How would you describe the process?\n\n# if the answer is NO, what is the major problem?\n\n# give me report\nGenerate a report for me.\nRequirements are:\nperspective A, B, C, and D, four parts of requirements.\nPerspective A is the problem definition from the previous question:\n\n[[ There is a new operation defined as follows:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\na and b are positive integers.\nSolve this problem using the above definition.]]\n\nPerspective B is the rule for the above-defined operation, and the rules are:\n[[The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.]]\n\nPerspective C:\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to follow the above rule is:\n\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to find the transformed form of a complex operation is:\n\nPerspective D:\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy ability of formal language is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Mathematical knowledge is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Quality of reasoning is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy quality of Mathematical modeling is:\n\n\nExtract the whole number and explanation.
