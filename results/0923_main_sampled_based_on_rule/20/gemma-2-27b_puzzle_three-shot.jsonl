When writing the coordinates, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number, and when the number of rows is equal, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number. When writing down two coordinate points, the smaller number is placed to the front.\n\n\n\n### Challenges and pitfalls:\n\n### An example of incorrect application:\n\n### Answer:\n[[A:(1,1)(1,3)\nB:(1,4)(3,4)\nC:(4,2)(4,4)\nD:(7,3)(7,6)\nE:(2,3)(5,3)\nF:(5,4)(8,7)\nG:(1,7)(5,7)\nH:(7,8)(8,6)\nI:(8,1)(8,3)\nJ:(9,6)(9,8)]]"}
