The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

At the end of the twentieth century, algorithms that are efficient and produce the largest number of zeros when decrypted became popular and widely adopted. It's important to understand how these algorithms, the best known of which is the data encryption standard (DES), operate below the surface. These algorithms employ a long array of numbers called a KDF (key derivation function), which is a key-dependent function, to encrypt data blocks. To decrypt messages, you must be familiar with the original ciphertext generated by the encryption algorithm.\n\n<strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://aes.stackexchange.com/questions/58/data-encryption…\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question01.png)\n\n### Question 1:\n\nProvide explicit examples of Python statements to obtain the frequency of each character in the input string using class lists.\n\nPlease specify the functions including and the function signature\nwith explicit examples.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This is the problem that I have seen from a lot times that the Ai will give wrong answer even if it gets the word, for example, from here the Ai`s got as answer `A`, but from that we can easily say that the `Ai`s`` gotten wrong answer is: `Iha` or `Hia`, so why the Ai got` A` answer?"}

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

You need to use the decryption algorithm, but not all of it. The \"Unified Algorithms Operational Instructions for the National Unified Algorithm Library\" in the \"Encryption Algorithm Assessment Standard\"\n\nEncryption cipher (related parameter calculation algorithms):\n\n1. Ciphertext Calculation Method\n\nThere are many methods to calculate the ciphertext, generally from:\n\n(1) According to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext, encrypt and count according to the encryption table, then encrypt the result character by character.\n\n(2) Use the previously calculated key to encrypt the data, and then encrypt according to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext character by character.\n\nEncryption is encrypted according to the corresponding table, and each character is converted into a corresponding position according to the original data. To do this, it is necessary to find the position of each character in the cipher text.\n\n(1) When the cipher text is not arranged in order, the commonly used way is to find the longest ascending position of the character. The shortest descending character from the long to the short position;\n\n(2) Determine that there is no encryption key, please refer to the Standard algorithm in the Unified Algorithm Library for definition.\n\nThe ciphertext above uses some encryption rules based on columns."}
