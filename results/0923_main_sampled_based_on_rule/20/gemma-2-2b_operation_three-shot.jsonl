If not applicable, you must write \"none.\".\n\n## Detailed Explanation:\n\n> 1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n\nIn the Question section, we are explaining the \"operation rule\". You will need to apply this rule exactly to solve the given question.\n\n> 2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n\nYour answer, as well as our answer, should be a number or a group of numbers. Double-check this step.\n\n> 3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nUpon receiving your answer, you should double-check it carefully a of least 4 times. This part is very important, so please take it seriously.\n\nThis rule is related to finding \"solution x\" in the given question. You will need to write the correct answer in the format provided, which has four parts:\n\n> Part 1: Clearly explain the \"operation rule\".\n\nExplaining the \"operation rule\" is crucial, as it will provide you with the necessary understanding of the rule and how to apply it to solve the given question correctly.\n\n> Part 2: Provide an example of your own.\n\nPlease provide a specific example to demonstrate your understanding of the \"operation rule\" and its application. This example will serve as reference for future calculations.\n\n> Part 3: Explain whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A.\n\nIt is crucial to determine whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A. Consider the example below.\n\nOperation Rule: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nOperation X: (1◎2)(3＋4)-(6◎1)\n\nFor this example, \"Operation X\" is not a valid substituted method for \"Operation A\". Therefore, we should proceed as follows to find the value of \"X\":\n\n(1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(8×2)(7)=(16×7) = 112\n\nThen, simplify the right side of the equation: (61x+2)◎(3◎7) = (61x+2)●(21) = (1261x+42)\n\nEquate the two sides and solve for \"X\":\n\n(16×7) = (1261x+42)\n\nSolve for \"X\":\n\nx = (16×7-42)/(1261)\n\nx = 86/1261\n\nx = 4/63\n\nTherefore, in this example, \"Operation X\" cannot be substituted for \"Operation A\".\n\n> Part 4: Clearly explain the method you used to find the correct answer.\n\nFinally, clearly illustrate the methods used to find the correct answer.

The custom operation requires 2 arguments, x and y, as well as the operator \"&\", \"*\" and the boundaries set in the defining function. The definitions of the operations (* = f f * ) indicate that the custom operation evaluates the given function (f) on the exterior region (D) based on the argument (x,y).\n\nTo compute f◆D, which requires use of f's f function, it is important to understand the meaning of & and \"*\" used in the definition. The & symbol represents the outermost expression, and \"*\" represents the inner nested expressions. This means that f◆D will be evaluated based on the arguments (x,y) using the specified function(s), and then a specific operation will be applied to the result.\n\nStarting with the first question, which asks to compute f◆D using f(x,y)=1, D: 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to this question should be:\n\nf◆D = ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy\nThe answer is a single number as required. To evaluate the integral ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, it is necessary to first determine the appropriate values of x and y that result in a non-zero fraction. In this case, only the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 satisfy all three arguments (x,y,f). Therefore, the integration region will be the area between these boundaries. The double integrals yields the value of the integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅1⋅dx·dy + ∫(2-1)⋅(3-2)⋅1⋅dx·dy = 2⋅2⋅1+1⋅1⋅dx·dy = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is:\n\nf◆D = [4]\n\nFor the second question, f(x,y)=xy, D:1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to the question should also be a single number. Note that the custom operation is the same in both questions, the only difference is the function definition, and the boundaries. Evaluating the function F by ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, yields:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = x⋅y⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration. In this case, the easiest way to find the appropriate bounds is to graphically observe the region defined by the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644949-90edfb0d-5963-4dc5-b2de-7d4ed72e4713.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral. The integral of this function is:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫xy⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫2⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅∫2⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅[(y+1)−(0+1)] = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅(y+1) = 8x⋅y2+8xy\nTherefore, the answer to the second question is:\n\nf◆D = [8(2)⋅32+8⋅(2⋅3)]=128\n\nFor the third question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand is:\n\nf(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y\nThe integration region has the same form as the region defined by 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 in the first question, so this question may be answered in a similar way:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅x2+y2⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nNote that the integrand is still constant and integration region has not changed:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅2⋅[(1+2)2+(0+1)2] = 6x2+6y2 = 6(x2+y2)\nTherefore, the answer to the third question is:\n\nf◆D = [6(12+32)]=40/3\n\nFor the fourth question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand and integration region are the same as in the previous question. Therefore, the integral can be evaluated:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(1+2)⋅(3-1)⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = ∫3⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫3⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644983-7a850cf2-36b9-4e30-b697-6b74bb9ab9d5.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫(x"}
