The problem statement is stated in the below format: \"Change the pattern in the original sentence to the end sentence.\"\n2. The output is stated in the below format: \".pattern={pattern}.\"\n3. The initial sentence is given. For every dictionary [english-pattern-rule.json] file there is a corresponding [pattern] dictionary (with keys) and corresponding [patterns] dictionary (with values).\n4. For the patterns that match the initial sentence, the pattern's name must be selected. For an unmatched pattern, the pattern can be set to the name of the first selected pattern to handle the matched sentences.\n5. For more accurate and specific custom rule, you can get a pointer to a text field widget (field1) and change the initial sentence by reading the value of field1(in a specific number of steps). Try it for yourselves!\n\n## Rule Constraints:\n\n```txt\n\n1. `pattern={value}.`\n    Contains only one `PATTERN` specified as a new pattern.\n2. `patterns={{ PATTERN := Number }}.`\n    Contains `pattern` specified as `{PATTERN}` key and corresponding `PATTERN` value.\n\n### Sample Results:\n\n```txt\n\nfrom pattern: \"test{}\"\nto pattern: \"test1{}\"\ninput = \"test{1}\"\noutput = \"test1{1}\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test1{}\"\nto pattern: \"test100\"\ninput = \"test1{0}\"\noutput = \"test1{0}\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test100\"\nto pattern: \"test1{10001}\"\n\ninput = \"test1{0001}\"\noutput = \"test1{10001}\"\n```\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n```txt\n\nfrom pattern: \"test\"\nto pattern: \"test1\"\ninput = \"test\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test1\"\nto pattern: \"test100\"\ninput = \"test1\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test100\"\nto pattern: \"test1000000\"\n\ninput = \"test100\"\n\n\n```\n\n## Expectations:\n\nThe assistant should be able learn two types by training custom rules to improve performance:\n\n1. Pattern learning: to identify the starting, ending and path-to-end patterns from input sentences.\n2. Input-pattern learning: to understand the patterns in the input-output translation.\n\n## Hints:\n```txt\n\n- Please implement the following two features:\n    1. Implement a step that is more accurate and specific custom rule.\n    2. Train custom rules based on `data-frame` that is written in the `[dictionary.json] file` with the key-value of `dict_to_frame`, `data-frame_to_dict`.\n```\n"}

Play and win when the sequence of the numbers matches the following rules:\n- The first three numbers must be odd.\n- They would multiply.\n- The result will be 0 modulo 4.\n2. Play and loss when the sequence of numbers does not match the rules.\n3. In any case, the game is over with N stones on the field.\n4. The first player to get zero stones wins.\n5. When the number of stones is zero, the player who won is a loser or the number of stones is zero, both lost.\n6.

The number of pyramids is never 6.\n2. Another requirement is the ability to distribute the number of pieces from 0 to 6 pieces in each pyramid row.\n3. The numbers of the pyramids must be distributed in adjacent rows of pyramids in a way that the number of pyramids will decrease in each row.\n4. Pyramids of the same type in a line with gaps between them count as one pyramid.\nFor example: [3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1] here\n3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 1 differs slightly from [3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1]\n\n5. You have to find the way the pieces of all pyramids are arranged. If there are any problems, you have to find the first place out of order.\nFor example:\nThe problem is in the following range:\n[3, 4, 9, 10, 2, 0, 1] where the last value equals 1.\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

If there are some unused cells, this number will be 5. The output answer should be the number range from 0 to 4.\n\n### Answer:\n[[4 5 5]]\n\n### Question:\n\n1.A pyramid with even numbers along the lines are missing and the missing numbers are even numbers;\n2.The pyramid composed of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 is missing;\n3.The other lines are filled correctly. For example, 2234567543232345678 are all correct answers, where all the numbers are from 0 to 8. If the missing numbers are all less than 1 to 8, there will be 8 missing numbers;\n4.If any of the lines cannot be filled perfectly, write that number accordingly;\n5.The last two triangles cannot be filled normally, otherwise, there are 1 to 5 missing numbers in the lines, and write the corresponding missing numbers in the gap, where the missing numbers must be filled correctly. A maximum of 5 numbers can be missing.\n\nConstraints: Each row must contain two triangles. There must be least one line to be filled, so that the time format is accepted under the constraints. It is guaranteed that the total number of missing values will be at most 5 and that some part of the pyramid is actually correct.\n"}
