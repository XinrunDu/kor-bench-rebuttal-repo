it with '#' in a way that the number of filled points is as close as possible to the number of points that satisfy the following rules:\n\n\n1.For every '#' on a white point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' (within 2 grids means it is in squares where 1 grid is the border of the 2 grids).\n2.For every '#' on a black point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' points (the same as 1).\n3.There is at least one '#' on each point.\n\nEvery input file is guaranteed to have an answer.\n\n### Format for input and output:\nThe format for input and output is as follows:\n[input]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n[output]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n\nOne line represents a picture, only alpha (alpha is used to represent a character in a String).\n\nOne line describes the output result.\n\n### Examples:\n```\nInput:[1][.......x][......xxx][..xx.xxxxx][xx.x.....][........x]\n\nOutput:\n[[1][x......][x......][x.....xx.]]\n```\n\n### Input:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx.x.x\n\n### Output:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx#x#x\n\n\n### Hint:\nConsider applying the rules one at a time to determine the number of empty spaces.\nFor example, you can start with rule 1 and determine which points require '#' under rule 1. Then, you can consider rule 2 to evaluate whether the points where all rules apply or if additional rules need to be considered.\n\n### Implementation of rule 1:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Implementation of rule 2:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n"}
