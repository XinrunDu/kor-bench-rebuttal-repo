For ~(~p1 & p2) to be false, ~p1 & p2 must be true, which happens when p1 is false and p2 is true. For ~p3 to be false, p3 must be true. Thus, the falsity value is:\n\nF: x|\u2713|\u2713\n\n### For Formula (2): (~p2 || p3) & (p1 =::> p2)\n\nThis formula is false when both parts are false. For ~p2 || p3 to be false, both ~p2 and p3 must be false, which means p2 is true and p3 is false. For p1 =::> p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false (but we know p2 is true from the first part, which is a contradiction), so the only way for the implication to be false is when p1 is true and p2 is false, but since p2 must be true from the disjunction analysis, there is no combination that makes the entire formula false without contradicting the conditions needed for the disjunction to be false. Therefore, this formula is a Truth Formula, and there is no falsity value for it.\n\nF: None\n\n### For Formula (3): (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n\nThis formula is false when both parts are false. For p1 =::> p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false. For ~(p1 & p3) || p1 to be false, both ~(p1 & p3) must be false and p1 must be false. However, this contradicts the requirement from the implication that p1 must be true. Since p1 must be true for the implication to be false, and ~(p1 & p3) can only be false if p1 & p3 is true (meaning both p1 and p3 are true), p1 must be true, and p3 must be true for the second part to be false in a way that is consistent with the implication being false. Thus, the falsity value for the formula is determined by the implication part, and the entire formula's falsity value is:\n\nF: \u2713|x|x\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\n[[F: x|\u2713|\u2713]; [F: None]; [F: \u2713|x|x]]"}

Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic formula D. All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the formula \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr, let's analyze it according to the specified logic rule:\n\n1. This formula contains propositional variables p, q, and r, and each appears only once in its negated form. They are arranged in ascending order of subscripts.\n\n2. The true assignment of this formula corresponds to all variables being false (000 in binary), which corresponds to hexadecimal number 0. This means the formula, if considered in its paired disjunctive term form, would be M0. However, since we're directly given the formula in a simple conjunctive form, we're looking for its representation in terms of paired conjunctive terms for its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. The principal disjunctive normal form of any formula includes all possible paired conjunctive terms that make the formula true. In this case, the formula is true only when all variables are false. Thus, its principal disjunctive normal form would indeed include m0, as it's the only term that corresponds to all variables being false.\n\nBased on the given criteria:\n\n- This formula is not a tautology since its principal disjunctive normal form does not include all 2^n (in this case, 2^3 = 8) paired conjunctive terms. It only includes m0.\n- It is not a contradiction since its principal disjunctive normal form does include paired conjunctive terms (specifically, m0).\n- It is a basic formula because its principal disjunctive normal form includes m0.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these classifications apply to the indices of the included paired conjunctive terms, which here is just m0 (an even number), but the classification requires all indices to be even or all indices to be odd, which does not apply given only one term.\n\nThus, the correct classification for \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr, according to the given logic rule and the specific definitions provided, is:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula).\n\nHowever, the question seems to mix the classification of formulas based on their principal disjunctive normal form (which includes terms like m0) with the classification based on their direct form as a simple conjunctive or disjunctive term. Since the formula \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr is directly given as a simple conjunctive term, and given the way the rule is structured, a more accurate interpretation, considering the question's format, might be looking for its classification based on its direct form. In that case, we would say:\n\n- It is not a tautology.\n- It is not a contradiction (because it's a well-formed, satisfiable formula).\n- It can be considered a basic formula in the context of being directly equivalent to m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, though the question seems to mix these interpretations.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these apply to the principal disjunctive normal form, and the direct form \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr doesn't fit these classifications in their currently mixed context.\n\nGiven the direct interpretation of the question and the options provided, without considering the mixed contexts of classification, the answer would more accurately reflect the direct form of the formula and its interpretation as a simple conjunctive term. However, since the question seeks an answer in the [[AB...]] format, strictly based on the given options and interpreting the question as asking for classifications based on the direct form of the formula rather than its principal disjunctive normal form, the most fitting answer would still be:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula), considering the direct interpretation of the question seeks an equivalent classification for the given simple conjunctive term, and given the options provided, this aligns best with the intention of identifying m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, even though the direct form doesn't inherently carry 'm' labels. \n\nIf strictly adhering to the direct interpretation of the formula and its immediate classification (correcting for the misinterpretation of expecting an 'm' label for a simple conjunctive term), which seems to be the intention given the provided options and the format, the answer would be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above), because the given formula, in its direct form as a simple conjunctive term, does not directly fit the provided classifications as they are explicitly defined for forms that include 'm' terms, and it does not strictly adhere to the 'm' notation or classification based on its direct form. However, given the provided context and the initial interpretation based on the principal disjunctive normal form (which includes the equivalent m0), the answer [[C]] (Basic formula) was provided, acknowledging the mix-up in interpretation between direct form and principal disjunctive normal form. The correction, considering the direct interpretation and the strict adherence to the provided lettered options without 'm' references, leads to [[F]] as the technically correct answer based on the direct form of the formula. \n\nThe confusion arises from the question's structure and the provided options not aligning perfectly with the direct form of the formula. Clarifying that the question seeks a direct interpretation of the formula without considering its principal disjunctive normal form (which was the initial assumption based on the provided logic rule), the final, technically accurate answer, aligning with the question's structure and provided options strictly, would then be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above). This is because, strictly speaking, the direct form \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr does not directly match any of the classifications A through E as explicitly defined for the 'm' and 'M' terms without those labels in the direct form context.

The given formula is already in CNF, so we can proceed with the algorithm.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ p \\wedge (p \\vee q) \\wedge (p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge (q \\vee \\neg r) \\wedge (q \\vee r) \\]\n\nEach clause in the formula is a simple disjunctive clause. Therefore, our initial sets are as follows:\n\n- \\( S_0 \\) is initially empty, as required by the algorithm.\n- \\( S_1 \\) contains all the simple disjunctive clauses from the formula:\n\\[ S_1 = \\{p, (p \\vee q), (p \\vee \\neg q), (q \\vee \\neg r), (q \\vee r)\\} \\]\n- \\( S_2 \\) is initially empty.\n\nBefore the second cycle of the resolution algorithm, we need to perform the resolution steps once.\n\n**First cycle:**\n\n1. **Resolve clauses in \\( S_0 \\) and \\( S_1 \\):** Since \\( S_0 \\) is empty, no resolutions are performed.\n\n2. **Resolve clauses in \\( S_1 \\):** We look for pairs of clauses in \\( S_1 \\) that can be resolved.\n\n   - Resolving \\((p \\vee q)\\) with \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\) using the literal \\(p\\), we get \\(q \\vee \\neg q\\), which is a tautology and does not add any new clauses since it resolves to an empty clause (denoted by \\(0\\)) under the resolution algorithm's definition. No further resolution is needed with these clauses.\n   \n   - Resolving \\((q \\vee \\neg r)\\) with \\((q \\vee r)\\) using the literal \\(q\\), we get \\(\\neg r \\vee r\\), which again is a tautology and resolves to \\(0\\). No further resolution is needed with these clauses.\n\n   - No other pairs in \\(S_1\\) can be resolved directly without involving \\(p\\) or \\(q\\), which are already resolved in a way that does not lead to new, non-tautological clauses.\n\n3. **Check \\( S_2 \\):** After the first cycle, \\( S_2 \\) remains empty because all resolutions resulted in \\(0\\), but the algorithm does not add \\(0\\) to \\(S_2\\); it just checks for implausibility, which does not occur in this case because all \\(0\\) results were due to tautologies, not contradictions inherent in the original formula.\n\nThus, before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm:\n\n- \\( S_0 \\) remains empty: \\( \\emptyset \\)\n- \\( S_1 \\) is unchanged (except we know certain pairs resolve to tautologies, but this does not alter \\(S_1\\)): \\( \\{p, (p \\vee q), (p \\vee \\neg q), (q \\vee \\neg r), (q \\vee r)\\} \\)\n- \\( S_2 \\) remains empty: \\( \\emptyset \\)\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n\\[ [\\emptyset; \\{p, (p \\vee q), (p \\vee \\neg q), (q \\vee \\neg r), (q \\vee r)\\}; \\emptyset] \\]\n\nOr, using the curly braces for sets as requested:\n\n\\[ [\\{\\}; \\{p, \\{p, q\\}, \\{p, \\neg q\\}, \\{q, \\neg r\\}, \\{q, r\\}\\}; \\{\\}] \\]"}

We identify the relevant properties and objects, apply the given logical operations, and ensure the output adheres to the specified notation and symbols.\n\nGiven:\n- E = \ud835\udc38 = natural numbers N.\n- a\u2032 = 0.\n- Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y and gJ(x, y) = x * y. However, only gJ(x, y) is relevant to the formula since it's the only one referenced.\n- Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nFormula to implement: \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\u2192F(x,y)\n\nStep 1: Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38.\nSince \ud835\udc38 is defined as the set of natural numbers N, we work under the domain of natural numbers.\n\nStep 2: Replace entity constants a with a\u2032.\nIn this case, a is replaced with its assignment a\u2032, which is defined as 0.\n\nStep 3: Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with gJ.\nSince g(x,a) is in the formula, we replace it with its implementation under \ud835\udc3d, which is x * y (in this case, a is replaced with 0, so we have x * 0).\n\nStep 4: Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\nThe predicate symbol F in the formula is replaced with its implementation under \ud835\udc3d, which is FJ, denoting x = y.\n\nImplementing these steps, we replace the formula components as follows:\n\n- Replace a with a\u2032: a \u2192 0.\n- Replace g(x,y) with gJ(x,y) = x * y and applying a\u2032 = 0, we get x * 0, which simplifies to 0.\n- Replace F with FJ, keeping in mind FJ(x,y) means x = y.\n\nApplying these replacements to the original formula \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\u2192F(x,y), we get:\n\n\u2200xFJ(gJ(x,0),x)\u2192FJ(x,y)\n\nSimplifying gJ(x,0) to 0, since multiplication with 0 yields 0, we further get:\n\n\u2200xFJ(0,x)\u2192FJ(x,y)\n\nGiven that FJ(x,y) means x = y, we can write this as:\n\n\u2200x(0 = x) \u2192 (x = y)\n\nHowever, we need to adjust this to fit the defined predicate FJ(x,y) directly, which means x = y. Thus, the correct interpretation, adhering strictly to FJ's definition, in the context of the logic rule and symbols provided, should be:\n\n\u2200xFJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y)\n\nThis formula reads as \"For all x, if the result of the function gJ applied to x and 0 equals x (which simplifies to if 0 equals x), then x equals y.\"\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under \ud835\udc3d, in the specified format, is:\n\n[[]]\n[\u2200x(FJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y))]\n\nPlease note the adjustment to directly use FJ as per its definition, reflecting the logical language \ud835\udc40's requirements."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The conclusions of the inspectors can be broken down into the following logical forms:\n\n- Inspector A: \"All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\" This is a Universal Negative proposition (E), which can be denoted as SEP, where S represents \"individual businesses\" and P represents \"paid taxes.\"\n- Inspector B: \"The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\" This is a Singular Negative proposition, but it does not directly fit into the A, E, I, O categorization as given, so we'll analyze the relationship between A and C directly.\n- Inspector C: \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\" This is a Particular Affirmative proposition (I), which can be denoted as SIP.\n- Inspector D: \"Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\" This is a Particular Negative proposition (O), which can be denoted as SOP.\n\nThe relationships specified are between A (Universal Affirmative), E (Universal Negative), I (Particular Affirmative), and O (Particular Negative) propositions. The question specifically asks for the relationship between Inspector A's statement (E proposition) and Inspector C's statement (I proposition).\n\nLooking at the relationships:\n\n- The relationship between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions is *.\n- The relationship between A propositions and E propositions is #.\n- The relationship between I propositions and O propositions is &.\n- The relationship between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions is %.\n\nSince we are examining the relationship between an E (Inspector A) and an I (Inspector C) proposition, we are in the first category. Therefore, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said is *.\n\n### Answer:\n[[*]]"}

But, given the duality of necessity and possibility and the relationships defined, we can infer this relationship from:\n\n(1 ) #p \u2190\u2192 !$!p\n\nSubstituting #p with !#!p in (1), we see that !#!p is equivalent to !!$!p, which simplifies to $p due to the double negation. This is essentially the same structure as (8), just arrived at through a different transformation.\n\nThus, the correct answer, directly reflecting the given inference step, is:\n\n[[8]]\n\nBut, since the direct step from !#!p to $p is actually derived through the relationship defined in (1), we can also say that the logical reasoning process involves both (1) and (8). However, since the question asks for the formula that corresponds to the inference step from !#!p to $p, and given the provided list of formulas, the most directly applicable formula is:\n\n[[8]]\n\nThis interpretation is correct under the assumption that the listed formulas are intended to be used directly or in combination to derive the necessary inferences. The inference from !#!p to $p is a direct application of the duality principle expressed in (1) and is formally captured by the structure of (8), even though the exact step is an intermediate inference based on the dual nature of necessity and possibility."}

This does not directly apply to Formula 17, as it deals with the relationship between a future period and its complement in the future, rather than two distinct points or periods.\n\n- **\u21a6 Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be true, but can both be false. Formula 17 fits this description. It says that `Gp` and `G\u00acp` cannot both be true (i.e., a proposition and its negation cannot both be true in the future period), which aligns with the \u21a6 relationship's property.\n\n- **\u26ad Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be false, but can both be true. This does not match Formula 17, as it explicitly states that if `Gp` is true, then `G\u00acp` must be false.\n\n- **\u2042 Relationship**: Pairs can both be true, or both be false.

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) \u2248 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation. However, in the context of the question, it seems to be asking for a proportional estimate based on the perfect representation premise of the U-Generalization."}

We are asked to apply the C-Reasoning rule and denote this symbolically. The attribute to be considered is exercising daily, which we denote as `S` as per the instructions.\n\nGiven:\n- In Region A: 90 out of 100 report exercising daily.\n- In Region B: 75 out of 150 report exercising daily.\n\nFirst, calculate the proportions for each region:\n- For Region A: \\(\\frac{90}{100} = 0.9\\)\n- For Region B: \\(\\frac{75}{150} = 0.5\\)\n\nApplying the C-Reasoning Rule:\n- Since the two samples (Region A and Region B) exhibit different proportions in the attribute `S`, but the rule asks for similar proportions, we will denote their comparison but note the proportions are not similar in this case.\n\nSymbolization for C-Reasoning:\n- \\(C(S, 0.9, 0.5)\\)\n\nThe symbolic representation, according to the C-Reasoning rule, indicates that while we are comparing the proportions of people exercising daily in the two regions, the proportions are not similar. However, the rule itself `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)` does not accurately capture the conclusion that they are not similar; it simply denotes the comparison. The conclusion about their similarity or dissimilarity is implicit based on the values.\n\nThus, symbolizing the entire observation based on the given information and the C-Reasoning rule as requested in the format `[[]]`:\n\n```\n[[C(S, 0.9, 0.5) \u2192 Pr(S, P_A) \u2260 Pr(S, P_B)]]\n```\n\nThis symbolization captures the comparison of the proportions of individuals who exercise daily in the two regions (Region A and Region B) and the conclusion that the proportions are not equal (`\u2260`), even though the C-Reasoning rule typically applies to inferring similarity. Here, it's adapted to reflect the comparison and the observed difference in proportions."}

The hypotheses are that the rats escape either because the light is on or because they hear a sound. These hypotheses, if true, lead to the same observation (the rats escaping), but they cannot both be true if the light being on and the sound occurring are mutually exclusive. This aligns with the structure of the GB Paradox, where a single observation (p) is explained by two mutually exclusive hypotheses (q_1 and q_2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThis is a GB Paradox."}

This aligns with the C! Principle, specifically the Speaker's Criterion which states that one should not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. The Hearer's Inference for C! Principle suggests that if such marked expressions are used, they imply a different meaning or intention than what could have been conveyed with an unmarked expression.

Thus, the scenario best fits the C! Principle.\n\nThe C* Principle and C% Principle do not directly apply here.

Specifically, B's statement \"I like her\" utilizes the Speaker's Criterion of the C* Principle, as it is weaker in information compared to what could have been stated (\"I love her\"), and does not conflict with the Information Principle. According to the Hearer's Inference CQ1, from the pair <love, like>, where \"love\" is the stronger term and \"like\" is the weaker, the statement \"I like her\" entails that B knows \"I love her\" cannot be established, thus implying B does not love Xiao Hong. This reasoning aligns with the C* Principle's framework.\n\nThe C% Principle would not apply here as B's response is not minimizing the information for the purpose of communication but rather choosing a specific weaker term to convey nuanced meaning. \n\nThe C! Principle is also not applicable because B's response does not involve lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions that would necessitate a different interpretation from a conventional or unmarked expression."}
