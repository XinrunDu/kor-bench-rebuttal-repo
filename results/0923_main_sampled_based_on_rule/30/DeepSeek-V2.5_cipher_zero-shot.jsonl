Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"X\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For \"T\", the corresponding pair is \"UV\".\n   - The cipher alphabet for \"UV\" is: QRSTUVWXYZNOPKLMABCDEFGHIJ.\n\n3. **Find the position of the plaintext letter in the standard alphabet and replace it with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet.**\n   - The position of \"Y\" in the standard alphabet ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ is 25.\n   - In the cipher alphabet QRSTUVWXYZNOPKLMABCDEFGHIJ, the letter at position 25 is \"Y\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer for the plaintext \"Y\" with the key \"TEWNLERG\" is:\n\n[[Y]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\" using the specified cipher rules, we follow the steps outlined in the encryption rules:\n\n1. **Padding**: The plaintext \"G\" is only 1 byte long, which is not a multiple of 8 bytes. Therefore, we pad it with 7 null characters (\\x00) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. The padded plaintext becomes: \"G\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting**: The padded plaintext is already 8 bytes long, so it is one block.\n\n3. **Block Encryption**:\n    - Convert Block to Bytes: \"G\" is the ASCII character with byte value 0x47.
