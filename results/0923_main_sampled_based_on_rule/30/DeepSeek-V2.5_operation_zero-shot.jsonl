First, compute the denominator:\n   \\[\n   (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n6. Next, compute the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (4 + 2i)(2 - i) = 4 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot (-i) + 2i \\cdot 2 + 2i \\cdot (-i)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 8 - 4i + 4i - 2i^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 8 - 2(-1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 8 + 2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n7. Now, the division simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[[2]]}\n\\]"}
