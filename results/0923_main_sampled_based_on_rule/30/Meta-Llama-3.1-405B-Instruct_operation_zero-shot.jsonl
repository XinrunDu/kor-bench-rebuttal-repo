We are given two equations based on this rule: 7 ○ 2 = 208 and 2 ○ 3 = 77.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Rule to the First Equation\nFor the first equation, 7 ○ 2 = 208, we substitute A = 7 and B = 2 into the rule to get (7 + 3*2) × (x*7 + y*2) = 208. This simplifies to (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208, which further simplifies to 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the First Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 13 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 7x + 2y = 208 / 13, which simplifies to 7x + 2y = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Second Equation\nFor the second equation, 2 ○ 3 = 77, we substitute A = 2 and B = 3 into the rule to get (2 + 3*3) × (x*2 + y*3) = 77. This simplifies to (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77, which further simplifies to 11 × (2x + 3y) = 77.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the Second Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 11 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 2x + 3y = 77 / 11, which simplifies to 2x + 3y = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the System of Equations\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) 7x + 2y = 16\n2) 2x + 3y = 7\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the second equation by 2 and the first equation by 3, we can eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal but opposite in sign.\n\n## Step 7: Eliminate y\nMultiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 4x + 6y = 14. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us 21x + 6y = 48. Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives us (21x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 48 - 14, which simplifies to 17x = 34.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of 17x = 34 by 17 gives us x = 2.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for y\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Using 2x + 3y = 7 and substituting x = 2 gives us 2*2 + 3y = 7, which simplifies to 4 + 3y = 7. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3y = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us y = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: [[x=2,y=1]]"}

However, we also consider the scenario where X could be any number larger than 4 but the operation § will always result in 8 being selected if the other number is 4. This misunderstanding needs correction as it does not align with the original analysis of how § operates. \n\nCorrectly, if X were less than 8 but greater than 4, (X § 4) would still equal X because X is larger than 4 in that range, but it wouldn't satisfy (X § 4) = 8 unless X is exactly 8 or more, in which case it would indeed be 8 or more that's selected, fulfilling the requirement of the operation.\n\nHowever, given the operation's definition and the requirement for (X § 4) to equal 8, it actually indicates X must be exactly 8 or more because the operation selects the larger number, and we have established that the larger number is 8. If X were less than 8, even if greater than 4, it wouldn't fulfill the given equation correctly as per the defined operation § unless it is exactly 8. Therefore, X must be greater than or equal to 8 to ensure that the larger number selected by § is indeed 8, aligning with the equation's requirement.\n\nThe correct interpretation should be that X must be greater than or equal to 8 because only then does the operation § yield 8 as required by the equation.\n\nThus, the answer should be correctly framed as:\n[[X ≥ 8]]"}

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4. Multiplying the entire equation by 4y to clear the denominator gives us 4 + 4y^2 = 17y.\n\n## Step 7: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation to a quadratic equation form gives us 4y^2 - 17y + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 4, b = -17, and c = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Plug in the values into the quadratic formula\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us y = [17 ± sqrt((-17)^2 - 4*4*4)] / (2*4).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression under the square root\nCalculating the expression under the square root gives us y = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 8, which simplifies to y = [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 8.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the square root\nCalculating the square root gives us y = [17 ± 15] / 8.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for y\nSolving for y gives us two possible values: y = [17 + 15] / 8 or y = [17 - 15] / 8, which simplifies to y = 32/8 or y = 2/8. Simplifying these fractions gives us y = 4 or y = 1/4.\n\n## Step 13: Recall that y = log base 3 of X\nGiven that y = log base 3 of X, we have log base 3 of X = 4 or log base 3 of X = 1/4.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for X\nSolving for X in both equations gives us X = 3^4 or X = 3^(1/4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the value of X\nCalculating the value of X gives us X = 81 or X = 3^(1/4). However, considering the initial equation and the context, X should be a positive integer, so X = 3^(1/4) is not suitable as it's not an integer.\n\nThe final answer is: [[81]]"}

Therefore, 6◎3=(6+3i)^2.\n\n### Step 2: Expand (6+3i)^2\nUsing the formula (a+bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2, we substitute a=6 and b=3. Therefore, (6+3i)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*3i - 3^2 = 36 + 36i - 9 = 27 + 36i.\n\n### Step 3: Express (X◎2)\nUsing the operation rule, X◎2=(X+2i)^2.\n\n### Step 4: Expand (X+2i)^2\nUsing the formula (a+bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2, we substitute a=X and b=2. Therefore, (X+2i)^2 = X^2 + 2*X*2i - 2^2 = X^2 + 4Xi - 4.\n\n### Step 5: Multiply (X◎2) by 2\n2*(X◎2) = 2*(X^2 + 4Xi - 4) = 2X^2 + 8Xi - 8.\n\n### Step 6: Express the equation with the results of steps 2 and 5\n(27 + 36i) + (2X^2 + 8Xi - 8) = 37 + 60i.\n\n### Step 7: Combine like terms\n(27 - 8) + 2X^2 + 36i + 8Xi = 37 + 60i.\n19 + 2X^2 + (36i + 8Xi) = 37 + 60i.\n\n### Step 8: Separate real and imaginary parts\nFor the real part: 19 + 2X^2 = 37.\nFor the imaginary part: 36i + 8Xi = 60i.\n\n### Step 9: Solve the real part for X^2\n2X^2 = 37 - 19 = 18.\nX^2 = 18 / 2 = 9.\n\n### Step 10: Solve the imaginary part for X\n8Xi = 60i - 36i = 24i.\nX = 24i / 8i = 3.\n\nSince both the real and imaginary parts must be satisfied simultaneously, X^2 = 9 implies X could be -3 or 3, but since the imaginary part directly gives X = 3, the correct answer that satisfies both conditions is X = 3.\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]"}

Separate conditions with 'or' if there are multiple conditions.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[you answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To compute A￡B according to the given operation rule A￡B = (A∪B) - (A∩B), let's break down the sets A and B and then apply the rule step by step.\n\nA = {x∣x is a real number}, which means A includes all real numbers.\nB = {x∣x^2 < 1}, which simplifies to B = {x∣-1 < x < 1} because the square of any real number cannot be negative, and only numbers between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and 1) squared will result in a value less than 1.\n\nNow, applying the operation rule:\n\n1. **Union (A∪B):** The union of A and B includes all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. Since A contains all real numbers, A∪B will simply be A, because all elements of B are already included in A. Thus, A∪B = {x∣x is a real number}.\n\n2. **Intersection (A∩B):** The intersection of A and B includes all elements that are in both A and B. Since B is a subset of A (all elements of B are also in A), A∩B will simply be B, which is {x∣-1 < x < 1}.\n\n3. **Difference (A∪B) - (A∩B):** This operation removes from the union all elements that are in the intersection. So, we remove from A (which is the same as A∪B) all elements of B (which is A∩B). This leaves us with all real numbers except those between -1 and 1 (excluding the endpoints).\n\nTherefore, A￡B = {x∣x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 1}.\n\n[[{x∣x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 1}]]"}

This means we will square the sum of a and bi.\n\n## Step 2: Compute (4◎5)\nUsing the rule, (4◎5) = (4 + 5i)^2. To square this, we apply the formula (x + yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi + (yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2, since i^2 = -1. So, (4 + 5i)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*5i - 5^2 = 16 + 40i - 25 = -9 + 40i.\n\n## Step 3: Compute (2◎3)\nSimilarly, (2◎3) = (2 + 3i)^2. Applying the same formula, (2 + 3i)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*3i - 3^2 = 4 + 12i - 9 = -5 + 12i.\n\n## Step 4: Add the results of (4◎5) and (2◎3)\nNow, we need to add the results from step 2 and step 3: (-9 + 40i) + (-5 + 12i). When adding complex numbers, we add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. So, -9 - 5 + 40i + 12i = -14 + 52i.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-14 + 52i}$"}

According to the rule, 3￠3 = log_3(3) + log_3(3) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 3: Use the result from step 2 in the original equation\nNow we have 2￠X = 5/2. Applying the rule again, 2￠X = log_X(2) + log_2(X) = 5/2.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for X\nTo solve for X, we need to use the properties of logarithms. However, directly solving this equation algebraically is complex due to the nature of logarithmic functions. We need to recall that for the equation to hold true, the bases of the logarithms should be such that they satisfy the given equation. A common approach is to test potential values of X that are powers of 2, given the base 2 in one of the logarithms.\n\n## Step 5: Test potential values for X\nGiven the nature of the equation, X should be a positive integer that, when substituted into the equation, gives 5/2. A logical approach is to consider X as a power of 2, considering the base of one of the logarithms is 2.\n\n## Step 6: Consider X = 2^2 (4) as a potential solution\nSubstitute X = 4 into the equation: log_4(2) + log_2(4) = 1/2 + 2 = 5/2. This shows X = 4 satisfies the equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"}
