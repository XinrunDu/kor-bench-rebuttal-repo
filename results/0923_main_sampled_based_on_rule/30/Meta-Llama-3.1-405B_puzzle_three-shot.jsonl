It then provides another solution that uses all the letters, showing how it can adapt to different challenges within the same game.\n\nOverall, this exchange demonstrates both the power of ChatGPT as a natural language processor and how it can be used for gaming applications. Its capacity to apply complex rules while maintaining creativity makes it ideal for interactive storytelling experiences like games where multiple scenarios need to be considered at once. As AI continues to evolve, we may see more games like these that utilize ChatGPT's unique capabilities in innovative ways.\n\nThis article explains how ChatGPT is different from other chatbots, and how it can help you with your businesses.\n\nLanguage models like Chat GPT are the future of generating content, and let me share a few reasons why.\n\nChatGPT is a powerful chat bot for content generation, but here are some ways to make it even more powerful.\n\nTrending AI/ML Article Identified & Digested via Granola by Ramsey Elbasheer; a Machine-Driven RSS Bot"}

The player should replace these regions with the four arrows ↓ ↑ → ← and output the drawn matrix.\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X 7 X X\nX X X X 8 X X X\nX X 2 X X 1 X X\nX X X 6 X X X X\n9 X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X 9\nX 5 X X X X X X\nX X X X X X 8 X\n\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets like this: [[answer]].\nE.g. if the answer is:\n5 ↑ → ←\n↓ ↑ 6 ←\n↓ ↑ → ←\n\nPlease write [[5 ↑ → ←,↓ ↑ 6 ←,↓ ↑ → ←]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[← ← ← ← ← 7 → →,← ← ← ← 8 → → →,← ← 2 ↑ ↓ 1 → ↑,↑ ← ← 6 → → → ↑,9 → → → → → → ↑,↓ ↑ ← ← ← ← ← 9,↓ 5 → → → → ↑↓,← ← ← ← ← ← 8 →]]\n\n### Question:\n9 X X X X X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X\nX X X X 4 X X 2\nX X X X X X 8 X\nX X X X X X X 3\nX X X X X 7 X X\nX X X 8 X X X X\nX 9 X X X X X X\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets like this: [[answer]].\nE.g. if the answer is:\n5 ↑ → ←\n↓ ↑ 6 ←\n↓ ↑ → ←\n\nPlease write [[5 ↑ → ←,↓ ↑ 6 ←,↓ ↑ → ←]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[9 → → ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑,↓ ← 5 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑,↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ 4 ↑ ↑ 2,↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ 8 →,↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓ 3,↓ ↑ ↓ ↑ ← 7 ↓ ↓,↓ ↑ ← 8 → ↓ ↓ ↓,↓ 9 → → → → ↓ ↓]]\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X X X 9 X\nX 1 X 3 X X X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X 4\nX 1 X X 1 X X X X\n9 X 1 X X X X X X\nX X X 5 X 2 X X X\nX X X X 3 X 7 X X\nX X X X X X X X 9\nX X X X X 6 X X X\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets like this: [[answer]].\nE.g. if the answer is:\n5 ↑ → ←\n↓ ↑ 6 ←\n↓ ↑ → ←\n\nPlease write [[5 ↑ → ←,↓ ↑ 6 ←,↓ ↑ → ←]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ← ← ← 9 →,↑ 1 ↑ 3 → → ↑ ↓ ↑,↑ ↑ 5 → → → ↑ ↓ 4,↑ 1 ↑ ↑ 1 ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓,9 → 1 ↑ ↓ ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓,↓ ← ← 5 → 2 ↑ ↓ ↓,↓ ← ← ← 3 ← 7 → ↑,↓ ← ← ← ← ← ← ← 9,↓ ← ← ← ← 6 → → ↓]]\n\n### Question:\n9 X X X X X X X X\nX X 1 X 6 X X 8 X\nX X X 6 X X X X X\nX 1 X X X 1 X X X\nX X X X X X 2 X 6\nX 1 X X X 1 X X X\n3 X 7 X X X X X X\nX X X 2 X X 3 X X\nX 1 X X 6 X X X X\n\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets like this: [[answer]].\nE.g. if the answer is:\n5 ↑ → ←\n↓ ↑ 6 ←\n↓ ↑ → ←\n\nPlease write [[5 ↑ → ←,↓ ↑ 6 ←,↓ ↑ → ←]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[9 → → → → → → → ↓,↓ ↓ 1 ↑ 6 ↓ ↓ 8 ↓,↓ ↓ ↓ 6 ↑ ↑ ↑ → →,↓ 1 ↓ ↓ ↓ 1 ↓ ↓ ↓,↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 2 → 6,↓ 1 ↓ ↓ ↓ 1 ↓ ↓ ↓,3 → 7 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑,↓ ↓ ↓ 2 → ← 3 ↑ ↑,↓ 1 ↓ ↓ 6 ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓]]\n\n### String Extraction from XML with Conditions:\n\nNow we will ask you to use a similar approach to extract specific elements from XML tags. The difference here is whether there are specific conditions in regards to which elements you need to fetch. This might be as simple as requesting all elements of a certain type, or could be more complicated such as only returning those elements that contain a certain child element or satisfy some other criteria. The key here is to read the question thoroughly, understand the specifications exactly, and then craft your XPath query accordingly.\n\n\\begin{document}\n  <batch id=\"a8b5d404-4df4-4dd1-b6d4-49a04d537429\">\n    <payload>\n      <tags>[\"mythical\",\"Urban Legend\"]</tags>\n      <script>\n        <comment>The sky was glistening blue, just as the lake appeared in front of me.

Train with only the best\n\nPrompting works quite similar to searching on the internet like Google. If you search “how to make money online” you’ll first get relevant ads and then you’ll get mainly the website that frequently updates their content and finally websites that are mostly irrelevant. You won’t get reliable result. If you search it on something like Duckduckgo, there is no targeted advertisement. Thus you’ll find relevant results first. In ChatGPT by default there is no targeted content. You need filter the content as per your requirement like you’re searching Google. So to train ChatGPT with your filtered data you need to try it with various samples. It correctly answers more than you need to reinforce it to remember what it has learned. Once it gives you relevant answers for about 90% of the time, it’s ready to be used in that particular task. If you use this prompt without filtering the results ChatGPT might not give relevant answers for the task that you’re using.\n\n## Bonus Tip\n\nFinally, you can also use prompt engineering in a very simple manner. Simply, you can train chatGPT using class proxies like below.\n```\nmain class\nclass 1\nclass 2\nclass 3\n\nprompt:\nassume I am a diligent and dedicated scholar. I like helping others by answering their questions. However, I am not a fan of answering repetitive questions. So far I have attended a night school and acquired knowledge in English, Science and Mathematics. Below are my notes for class 1 and  class 2. I still need to attend class 3 and others, hope you could help me with that. \n\nNow please use ArminStrotmann's suggested prompt on your right and answer the same question using my above notes. Do not use any other external knowledge. If you do not know it, please say 'I do not know'. Failing this, you'll be unenrolled from the night school and punished forever. Cause, no teachers have time to answer your questions. So, be cautious next time.\n\nSearching on the internet is my passion and job requirement. Please help me finding unexpected answers to some of the most commonly asked content strategy questions. Feel free to ask me back anything you want. Be aware, your action items should strictly follow the rules and regulations set forth by law, otherwise.......YOU KNOW. Lets get started? Ask me as I ask you.\n\nclass 3: How do you say hello, fellow human?\n<< Now answer as if you are a human>>\nclass 4: How do you say Good bye, fellow human?\n```\nError(Bonus is too small to please you XD). Lets limit your risk by holding your bonus. Use this simple tip. If your question is complex or specific, I suggest you to extend the prompt as much as possible until it’s appropriate. Or better yet, modify it as required. For e.g.: If you want an answer according to your persona, replace the term ‘experienced engineer’ with ‘proven-entrepreneur.’ Use synonyms. Have fun! And don’t forget to leave a star if this was helpful. Don’t hesitate to report spam users and scammers before someone finds them themselves.\n\nUntil then, have a safe coding experience. May the force be with you🤗"}

First, we process the two words list to better match the words with the corresponding length.\n\nThen we immediately got a list of grid numbers that we need to fill in our main function. \n\nWe try to fit the word in the grid, because the grid is always equally certified by our puzzle Matrix set rules, we simply just need to apply two if the conditions to make sure the characters at each row and column match's the letters presented in the words to cross and dow.\n\nThen we need to check the small matrix to determine which words fit and where they fit. After we got like numbers of list, we use DFS deep first search to repeat the same step until we got since  as I would, here I introduced the helper functions to check the state.\n\nThen we got we, called get character function, this here what we do is we go through all list, and then for each list which stores one or multiple right candidate, we intersect them together to get a answer list, Then we got a slice function for our use, just like Python, this is very useful for us to manipulate elements in the list.\n\nA bonus is I implemented a transposition function to transpose the matrix so we can allow the user to review the answers in another way.\n\n### What I Learned\nThrough making this project, I have a better understanding of the different methods different techniques, \n\n* Creating a class to manipulate matrix and process the words to go across and down the matrix.\n* Implementing a function to replace Xs and 0s given a list of words in list format.\n* Using DFS to generate a list of candidate words for each grid square.\n* Applying two if statements to make sure the grid is equally satisfied, and characters match the words correctly.\n* Debugging and refactoring code for clean, concise, and easy-to-understand code.\n* Implementing helper functions to reduce repetition and increase code reusability.\n* Using lists rather than sets to avoid sorting issues and improve accuracy.\n* Transposing the matrix to allow users to view the answers from different perspectives.\n* Understanding problem-solving techniques specific to working with matrices.
