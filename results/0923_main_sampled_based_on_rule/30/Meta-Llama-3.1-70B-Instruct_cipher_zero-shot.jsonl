However, considering the original intent of being the opposite of the encryption steps and that step (3) in encryption replaces a letter with one from substitution_alphabet, in the decryption we should replace \"K\" from the result of step (2) with its position in the standard_alphabet that corresponds to \"K\" in the reversed_alphabet. Instead, find the position of \"K\" in reversed_alphabet and get its position from the reversed_alphabet in \"standard_alphabet\", it should be \"T\" that maps to \"K\" in reversed order but \"K\" will always map to \"T\". So:\n  Find the 11th position in standard_alphabet, which is indeed \"K\", but in reverse mapping from the reversed alphabet (with this specific step needing correction to properly align with inverse processes) for this type of encryption algorithm it should be mapped as (since nothing changes) it follows L to K mapping inversion back to \"K\", however this seems more steps due to reversed order steps concern confusion with reversing.\n\nIn order to maintain consistency in responses to this process using an inverted reversal simply implements (A to Z) and generate L for \"K\".\n\nConsidering these factors here on maintaining inverted procedures on final result presumed [[L]]."}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"X\"\nperiod: 6\nincrement: 3\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"BU\", we need to follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. Clean up the plaintext: \"BU\" is already clean, so no modifications are needed.\n\n2. If the plaintext is of odd length, add a letter 'X' to make it of even length: \"BU\" is of even length, so no modifications are needed.\n\n3. Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: \"BU\" is already a two-letter group.\n\n4. For the double-letter group \"BU\" of the plaintext:\n    - In Gird1, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird4, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird2, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird1, which is 'D' (1st row, 2nd column) and 'U' has no position in the row with 'B' so we proceed with next rows, we find 'U' at (2nd row, last column) but there is a different letter at the intersection of 2 columns, hence intersect the 2nd column and the column of 'U', find the letter corresponding to this position which is 'F'. Next find the letter at the row of 'B' from Gird1 and column of 'U' from Gird1 to get the result, we find 'B' at (1st row, last column - D comes before B, so the row cannot be the one where 'D' and 'G' are) the row must be the one where 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N' are, because if we go further, 'U' cannot be there, we find 'M'.\n    - In Gird3, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird4, which is 'K' (3rd row, 1st column is V and B comes after A so that cannot be, if we go to the next row A comes before B and so the one row below that one should have B) and find the letter corresponding to 'U' which has no position in the row with 'B', so find 'U' in other rows (at 1st row last column). Now find 'M' from previous result, form columns and find other letters around M from other Grid - K comes above.\n    In such case as an intersecting columns approach didn't provide us with values we would use two rows - of M from Grid1 and other letter would normally appear one row below or above.\n    Hence combining this logic for bu the final values for an encrypted result out of two grid for bu in a first grids turns C M.    \n    Therefore, the encrypted answer is [[CM]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"WG\", we need to follow the decryption rules.\n\n1. Find the corresponding row and column coordinates for each letter in the ciphertext:\n   - W: (4, 1)\n   - G: (2, 6), but since there is no 6 in the column index, G is actually at (2, 1)\n\nHowever, we need the exact coordinates within the 0-4 range for G. Looking at the grid again, we realize G is at (2,1).\n\n2. Combine all row and column coordinates: \n   - Row coordinates: [4, 2]\n   - Column coordinates: [1, 1]\n\nHowever, we made an incorrect assumption on the columns and rows for W and G: \n- W is indeed at (4,1) in the grid but its row 4, column 1. (since column only goes 0 to 4)\n- G is indeed at (2,1) in the grid but its row 2, column 1.\n\n Knowing the original sequence would be: Row (for W) column(for W) Row (for G), column (for G)\n\n So it is: [4 1 2 1], now separate the original rows and columns to get the pairs for decryption: \n- Row coordinates: [4, 2]\n- Column coordinates: [1, 1]\n\nNow the correct sequence of (Row then Col):\n\nTo find the actual column coordinates and not confuse it, remember it goes in the order of: row, column and in order.\n- Row coordinates: 4 is the first row, so it goes first. Next row for encryption was 2.\n- The original columns for decryption were both 1.  \nNow put in (4,1) and then (2,1). Now, actually get the letters from the cipher and they would be WG.\n\nUsing our example from the prompt for decryption, but correcting it I see it says: The first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n\n WG in decryption as (4,1) and (2,1), gives us the proper Encryption of those letter pair \n which gives us the real WG coordinates as [4, 2], and the others as: [1,1]. To read it then\n then would we keep the (4,1) and (2,1). The text uses Letters: AC for their example."}

Since \"#\" is used as a delimiter to switch columns, split the ciphertext at each \"#\".\n\n- Now, write each letter from top to bottom. The column count is determined by the column count in the ciphertext (i.e., at each \"#\", switch to the next column). Since the ciphertext has a total of 6 \"#\", we need 6 columns. And, to make the set column and row consistent we count them based on #.\n\nO - F - W\nC - M - T\nF - H - (no character)\nU - U - (no character)\n\n\n- After this, we read the lines according to the specified rules: odd number rows from left to right and even number rows from right to left. Odd numbers row here is 1 and even is 2.\n\n\n- Reading according to the specified rows: first row OFW (from left to right), second row TMHUU (from right to left as MUUT), so [\"OFW\", \"MUUHUT\"]\n\n\n- Now the term consists of 'OFW' and 'TMHUU'; This agrees with insertion order at learning whole.\n\n\n- Then put term into further segregated condition and prefix may follow OFW. \n\n\nSo putting all together OFWMUT is  \"OFWMUT\" with meaningful enhancing mut cutting effective outcome rate gain OF WITH.\n\n\n[[OFWMUT]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"XV\", we follow the decryption steps:\n\n- Divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"X\" and \"V\"\n\nSince \"XV\" has only two characters, we treat it as a direct mapping to row and column.\n\n- The position of X in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 (Y C G X 7 L) and the position of V in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 ( J V O E M).\n- However, X is in a different row. X's position in the matrix should be looked up for accurate row number - X is at row 3. V's position in the encrypted character set tells us the column should be column corresponding to the third letter in the encrypted character set. We look up V, and it's in row 5. So the column in our 6x6 matrix isn't 3 with X and V, instead it's row and column numbers of where they stand and with 0 representing \"A\". Given just \"XV\", finding row and column from the positions in \"ADFGVX\" back to 0-5, we note:\n  - X is in \"Y C G X 7 L\". But X appear at 3 in encrypted character set 'ADFGVX'. However, when looking at 4th row (3 in 0-5 notation), X's row is \"Y C G X 7 L\" or 3, converting this row to the proper row using \"ADFGVX\", we note X = 'X' is indeed at the correct row. The row of 'X' in \"ADFGVX\" is 3. From there X is 4 in 'ADFGVX', it indeed holds true. The value of X in ADFGVX thus gives us the column, not row. The value of V in ADFGVX gives us column and V sits at row 5, 0 represents A in 'ADFGVX'. So, from step to step say V is value, say third value has it be column, our A is 0, last value column is 5.\n    Decrypted column (V's value in ADFGVX - 0) = 5 \n    Our current paragraph row decrypted (current row from X's value - 0) = 3 \n    Input encrypted string value represented X into columns to represent alphabet. And value is from position 5 as per the current column number corresponding value encrypted in that place.\n\n\nPlaintext is at: [[Y]]"}

Convert the plaintext into a sequence of bytes using ASCII encoding:\n   G - 71, S - 83, H - 72, H - 72, C - 67, T - 84, U - 85, U - 85, R - 82, V - 86, L - 76\n\n2.
