Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Conversion of the plaintext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of a keystream value from the pile of cards using the \"keystream algorithm\" (see below).\n    \n3. Addition of the keystream value to the plaintext letter number (modulo 26).\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting ciphertext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \n\nEach invocation of the keystream algorithm computes a single keystream value y. It modifies the pile D and thereby influences the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n\nHere is the keystream algorithm:\n\nLet A represent the first joker (which is 53) and B represent the second (54).\n\n1. Move A down one position in the pile. If it is already at the bottom of the pile, put it at the top, immediately beneath the top card.\n2. Move B down two positions in the pile. If it is already on one of the bottom two positions, move it around to one of the top two positions (respectively the bottom and the top of the pile).\n3. Perform a triple cut: Take the part just above A and the part just below B and put their order-reversed concatenation at the bottom of the pile. The deck is always treated as a circular region.\n4. Perform a count cut: Take out that many cards from the top of the pile and insert them just above the last card of the pile. Joker A counts as 53; there is no effect for Joker B.\n5. Look at the value of the top card. Joker A counts as 53; ignore Joker B and repeat the algorithm. Use the value of the computed card as the resulting keystream value y.\n\nIn a streamlined version of this algorithm, card A only changes position if it's not the bottom card or at the top, card B only moves if it's not at the top two positions, and the triple-cut step is not executed if A precedes B. These tweaks have no effect on the keystream but make the implemented algorithm faster by performing fewer operations (on average).\n\n### Question: General Question\nDescribe the algorithm for decryption.\n\n### Answer\nThe decryption algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Conversion of the ciphertext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of the corresponding keystream value using the \"keystream algorithm\" from above.\n    \n3. Calculation of the plaintext letter number from the ciphertext letter number using subtraction modulo 26.\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting plaintext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \nFor each ciphertext letter, a respective keystream value is computed. Each keystream determination modifies the pile D and thereby affects the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n"}

So if the input contains punctuation or spaces, it will be trimmed. If it is not all uppercase, it will be converted to all uppercase.\n\n- The alphabet used in the encryption has to be an uppercase string of letters without \"J\". So the encrypted output will only contain Uppercase letters and \"J\".\n\n- The output has to be formatted in double brackets [[]]. So the assistant should prepend and append the answer with the brackets in the final output when it provides the answer.\n\n- The assistant should not add additional comments when returning the answer. It should focus on using natural language to answer the encryption and decryption questions posed above.\n\n- If the input fails to follow the specified format if follows to specification, the response should start with \"Error\". For example, if the input is lowercase text, but uppercase letters are required, the response will be: Error: Input must contain only uppercase letters.\n\nThis rule is used to guide a conversational AI assistant to understand the requirements of encryption and decryption tasks, so that it can answer instantly, even when asked about new messages.\n\n## Comments\nUsing grid-based encryption techniques,\n\nTying in specific grid operations based on character frequency,\n\nEncryption method.\nEnhanced complexity through complex operations.\n\nEncryption method. \n\nCombination of encryption and encryption decryption methods,\n\nThe agent is guaranteed to correctly complete the encryption and decryption tasks."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (There is no letter J.Its row and column coordinates are between 0 and 4.):\n        - U  B  I  L  A\n        N  T  C  D  E\n        F  G  H  K  M\n        O  P  Q  R  S\n        V  W  X  Y  Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from plaintext.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n    - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"BX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The default list the cipher uses is: `MRLIHARWEAOKGNUEVDSCYXPBZQJT` It is recommended to stick to this list for simplicity when testing this cipher.\n\nWhen this option is enabled, the process of encryption and decryption changes in the following ways:\n- During encryption: If a letter in the block is part of the diceware list, replace the letter with the place where it appears in the list. For example, if the plaintext is \"hello world\", then according to the diceware list MRLIHARWEAOKGNUEVDSCYXPBZQJT, the letter 'H' appears 2nd, 'E' appears 6th, etc., so the message \"hello world\" would be encoded as \"262163 6141421\".\n- During decryption: If a letter in the current decrypted message is part of the diceware list, keep it as is. If not, then check if the letter is of the form 'XN', where 'X' is one of the numbers 1-9 representing the position in the list, and 'N' is the actual letter in that position. For example, since 'A' is at position 6 of the diceware list, if we encounter '6A' in the ciphertext, we will interpret it as 'A'.\n\n#### Extended Mode:\nThe **Extended Mode** adds three extended encryption/decryption rules that serve as **default** controls, meaning they are enabled by default, and can be turned **disabled**. Here are the extended rules and their effect:\n- **Mirror Mode:** If enabled, the entire grid filled with the template on four quarters will be mirrored horizontally after  decoding/encryption operation to generate new ciphertext and plaintext. Mirroring example: after filling the grid by rules, replace the fourth line with the first line, the third line with the second line, the second line with the third line, and the first line with the fourth line.\n- **Reverse Order Mode:** If enabled, the final ciphertext or plaintext after the decryption/decryption operation will be inverted.\n- **Sodium Mode:** If enabled, the entire grid encrypted/decoded by the template will apply a substitution cipher to the ciphertext and plaintext using salt (**N**) as a key, where **N** is the number of '#' in that ciphertext/ciphertext. The replacement mode is to start moving the letter encoding table **N** space to the right, take the corresponding new letter, and form the complete ciphertext/ciphertext blocked after the conversion. For example, if there are 4 instances of '#' in the ciphertext, then 'A' becomes 'M', 'B' becomes 'N', and so on.\n\n#### Customizable Commands:\n\n- `diceware=<word-list>`\n    - Add dictionary list <word list> to the cipher when calling this option and the additive functions it supports.\n    - Here, <word list> must be a 26-letter string consisting of letters. Letters that appear for the second time and after can be ignored.\n    - Note: This command line can be called multiple times, and the last setting is in effect.\n- `disable`\n    - Disables the extended default encryption rules in extended mode that the cipher contains. Namely disables: Mirror Mode, Reverse Order Mode, Sodium Mode.\n- `enable`\n    - Enables the extended default encryption rules in extended mode that the cipher contains. Namely enables: Mirror Mode, Reverse Order Mode, Sodium Mode.\n\n#### Query Commands:\n\n- `help`\n    - Display instruction information about supported command lines and extended functions.\n- `load` \n    - Restore the original default setting for encryption/decryption operations.\n    \n\n### Extended_test:\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"YSSSYLSDNIKOEYRVVIGEAUVIEORBKEMHWQKMKJCYILKICGYSANKYYNWLBLGHHALIJYTKOCSDCXAVJYAKOETEVCCAWAEGNHFQAXTWWEOGHIOYPCGNA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
