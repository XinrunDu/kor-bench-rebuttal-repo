If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the message, including the height, depth, and length, as well as the cover format.\n2. Imitate the original volume sales data, including the book title, author name, and sales volume.\n3. Obey the specified book spine format and requirements.\n\n### Book Spine Format:\n\nThe book spine will be in a <td> tag, each representing a book, containing two elements:\n    1. The title of the book, represented only by the first 3 characters of its name, and its <h3> element tag must not be nested, so the tag is <h3>n</h3>.The text within the tags should be rendered in a specific CSS class.\n    2. The quantity of copies sold, must be expressed in *'s, one * represents 1000 copies, so if a book sells 3000 copies, its tag will look like <em>n*</em>.The tags must also be in the cascade of <td> elements.\n\nYou can use relative font sizes to control the width of the <td> in which the tag is contained, using the value of \"width-frequency-height\" (e.g. 13 in a 13x13 table is 13x13/1000 = 1.3/100 = 1,3% in width)\nIf the quantity of copies sold ends with 0, you can display the digits with *'s as well, e.g. 13350 would be n**.*\n\nFor example, a table representing a specific book would yield a result in the following format:\n\n<td style=\"width: 13%\">\n    \t<h3>n</h3>\n    \t<em>n**</em>\n</td>\n\nThe book represents James Patterson's \"Ape Next Door\", which has been purchased by 133,500 customers.\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by the most popular author\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\nThis means that the order in which the books' **<td style=\"width: 13%\">** elements are displayed in the first row is from left to right.\n\nTo achieve this.
