wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Savvy Hint:\nKi determines fundamentally a person’s capacity to fight, therefore, the Full Power Kame Hame Ha, which can explode the whole planet, is also driven by the most powerful Dragon Ball Ki.\n\n### Additional Story:\n\nThe Temple on Earth is the highest place, The Temple is the place that the God lives on the Earth. The Temple is the only place that God lives on Earth. Every area on Earth is obviously below the Temple. The God of Destruction only terminates life operations while the God of KingKai maintains the life operations of other regions. NamesKians have a special ability and they are all from NameK. The Temple is the highest place on Earth. A person can't even directly fly to the Temple. This trip was accomplished through a teleportation function. There are quite many Gods live on the Earth. Each of them is dedicated to a different area of The Human Race. Each story about a God tells something about a specific area, and these stories have become the truth. Every God has a special fate and life operation, and the only way to terminate a God's life is for the God of Destruction to commit suicide himself.\nSatan makes a joke as long as he starts his acting. After all, like Princes, the person who was chosen to play Satan cannot act accordingly if he’s not trained as an actor. There were countless actors who has gone to hell during their acting career, but Satan's high IQ has made him the best one so far who has survived the audition. Like the great actor Kamijyou Toji, the god is good at maintaining the social life of each area. Time and time again, the most evil legacy of Satan has been fundamentally buried and the devil's history has been constantly covered up. Of course, the most deviously famous Buddha has been buried in the West, and it's said that over three hundred countries are Buddhists in the West. If Akira Kurosawa adapts the history of the secret \"Ten Calamities\", or the multiple conflicts in Buddhist history, the plot revolves around the Buddha, but there would be immense background scenes of various power struggles, assassinations, and conspiracies. None of these conflicts have been made public, having been kept strictly secret.\n\n### Beautiful Hint:\nIt's said that the truth of the \"Ten Calamities\" is known by the minds of the audience, but there are also numerous other old stories that it's unrelated. Although the \"Ten Calamities\" story connects many Buddhist ideas, there are, of course, no archeological finds supporting the truth of the \"Ten Calamities\". This makes \"Ten Calamities\" looks more like a fictional story than an actual ancient story. People can generally withstand sorrow and suffering, but they’re never fond of evil and death. Say Cristo', Lord God, Pray and save you from your tribulation. Although the versions of \"Ten Calamities\" stories varies slightly, these supplemental stories are apparently intended to avoid the two stark facts that are slightly hard to understand. The first fact is that Buddhists don't believe in God and the second fact is that there is no archeological remains of Buddhas. The background of the history and fall of the holy Buddhas are full of themes of sorrow and suffering, evocation of passions, and conflicts between good and evil. Those might be too much for the world’s pursuit of peace and happiness to bear.\n\n### Additional Story:\n\nBuddha has been widely respected, looked up to, and loved by the general public. However the knowledge about \"Ten Calamities\" is kept from the public. Just for the secret joke of the Buddha, this secret has been that so far. However, any beings are either human, a God or Toop or a fairy, they are against the Buddhists."}

It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word: sturdy. It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk.

They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\".

Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

You can share your ideas through drawing or writing.\nAnswer: Monsters were able to take on different appearances according to the stories they existed in. Some monsters were ugly, with abnormal appearances such as horns, claws of knives, and hideous distorted faces. Some monsters had beautiful appearances, but they had unpleasant personalities. How strange everything looked, the more they exerted the power of the witch, the more the appearance would change, but on the inner battlefield, we humans were very cruel to each other. And even stronger than these strong witches, their souls also seem evil. Monsters are indeed a terrifying force, but they are only in everyone's souls. Everyone is actually a monster, if you do not believe it, just go and take a look at the mirror. I believe that it will no longer be a sacred place for you.\n\n1. Monsters have their own characteristics, with very diverse roles and appearances. If I were to use a classification standard in my own mind, I would divide monsters into three categories: those who use magic powers through dark methods, those who possess superhuman abilities without magical transformations, and those who cannot increase their abilities and instead go to great lengths to improve their appearance. It is very interesting to find that in your story, the \"Witch of the Wastes\" was used by the scarecrow, which showed that the power of the witch is much stronger, but it also seems that the people of the country deliberately suppressed the ignorant people, let them start wars and antagonism. Their actions are like a child playing a video game, all of it is just for kill away the enemy, but who is the enemy, and what is the real purpose behind the move? Another point is that both Howl and Calcifer admit that they do not want war, but they will not change the course of the war. This is because when they are against war, most of the citizens in the country will not agree with them. Either way, it will have a negative impact on their relationship with the citizens, and at this point, even although how much they want to avoid war can no longer change their decision. We see in their own story, how powerful their own powers are. But we often say, the power of a person is measured by its expansiveness, and the power of a person is also hidden in the times. At that time, the wizards were far stronger than the soldiers in terms of combat power. And the sad thing is that prominent figures in their country completely saw wizards as atrocious, and that is the character magic, because they did not need to dedicate themselves to society, and their potential was far beyond the average citizens of the city. So does this mean that if we have more powerful wizards in the country, we should recognize their abilities? Does this mean that their contribution to the country is more valuable than the other citizens? After recognizing the power of their own ability, should I allow them to go down the path of magic and cultivate their own power, or should they be consigned to a street performer of the human world? I think here is the dilemma that arises in the minds of people here, but no matter what road they take, the result is what it is now, while the real authors of the war have remained anonymous, while both the prince and Howl reject war. But only the two great powers of the wizards are recognized and reached by the royal court, while Howl returned to his profession, living in the castle. A mobile castle, while walking all over the mountains and oceans of the world. In this world, there is no truly pure scenery, there will always be surrounding areas and places where an ugly scenery will appear. I think with other wizards, Howl is one of the biggest reasons for the war. It was their selfishness, mixed with the selfishness of war, that also led to the destruction of countless cities, towns, and villages. And the wiser, or maybe, even the powerful, In five wars, no one will be able to stop their own war, and all those who destroy the enemies of the enemy are betrayed in the same spirit.\n\n2. Monsters possess a variety of traits that allow them to alter their characters and enhance their magical abilities to fulfill various roles. Personally, I think monsters can be classified into three categories: those who cultivate their own abilities using dark or restricted methods, those who achieve improvements without drawing upon supernatural means, and those who raise their self-esteem through exceptional endeavors. In your fictitious story, the 'Witch of the Wastes' bestows particular abilities onto the scarecrow. This reveals extreme difference between the strength of witches and the rest of the population. Despite this stark disparity between ones using magic and others relying solely on martial arts, the former is undeniably more powerful. Even so, it appears as though authorities in the given country are suppressing intelligent individuals; society is built upon antagonism and war. The country imposes immense pressure on members within, essentially transforming their appearance into that of a soldier partaking in the attack. Transitioning now to the next point - both Howl and Calcifer claim to abhor war; yet they cannot stop it, merely due to its massive scale and subsequent opposition to such initiatives. As such, in order to maintain cordial relations with society at large, the two individuals are compelled to participate in a war that does not serve their interests. To summarize - even with tremendous power at their disposal, characters such as Howl and Calcifer are unable to preclude conflicts entirely. Instead, they must reluctantly participate despite their efforts to the contrary. In this segment, I particularly enjoyed learning about the 'Witch of the Wastes', despite her chilly disposition, and how she had completely abandoned her restraint while performing rituals. In addition, the characters suffered from the influence of others, to the point where they were willing to transform into soldiers so as to help defend their empire. As a result, societies utilized such acts as a means of taking advantage of those with undervalued powers and latent abilities. Eventually, both individuals would cultivate their individual talent, resulting in superiority over all else. Yet it was not enough, and society continued to escape their obligations of betterment. Realizing the potential of monsters, we yet again witness the very same dilemma vexing us here on Earth today. Should we acknowledge their prowess within society? Are they worthy of becoming our next natural-born heroes? Being cognizant of their powers encourages us to observe their transformations while also examining our own efforts towards advancement.\n\n3. Monsters have their distinct characteristics; their roles and appearances vary. In my own mind, I categorize monsters as follows: those who exploit their magic powers through questionable methods, those who possess exceptional abilities without having to rely on magic transformations, and those who strive to boost their appearances by all means available. The Witch of the Wastes clearly has more power than her peers, owing to her joining hands with the scarecrow in this tale. Regardless of any differences in abilities or fighting prowess, I believe magic is still the more potent. That being said, it seems society isn't very embracing of magic and is instead suppressing non-aggressive individuals through war. The country is dominated by those that insist on fighting; thus they manage everyone to be like soldiers. Furthermore, Howl and Calcifer both consider themselves incapable of preventing or resisting such destructive power, because they find themselves incapable in having a strong stand in opposition, which is an inevitability in such a society. When even those with such incredible powers are doomed to failure, it's clear that the problem must lie with the society and its reliance on wars. For instance, it's apparent that the wizard and Calcifer don't have a choice in being conscripted by the government; instead, they realize that when wars arise, they'll be forced to flex their muscles in service of the country. Either way, they will lose their dignity, even if they hate war. Eventually, both the scarecrow and the wizard accepted that they could not overcome the warheads of the country or stop this world from war.\n\n4.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means.
