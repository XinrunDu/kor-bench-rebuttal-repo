Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nDefine an operation such that when a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2.\nWhen b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2.\nIf a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\nBoth a and b are integers.\n\n### Question:\nIf 25※X※14=4, find X.\nWhen providing your answer, please enclose it in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. \nIf there is more than one correct answer, separate the answers with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To solve for X, we need to use the operation rule provided: If a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2. If b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2. If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\n\nGiven the equation 25※X※14 = 4, we can start by deducing the relationship between 25, X, and 14.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 could be on the inside of the repeated operation, and we'd have 25 modifications (one per occurrence of the repeated operation). However, this would result in a multiplication of 25 raised to an undefined power, which is impossible. So, X must not be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, 25 also cannot be a multiple of X or 14, as it would violate the given equation.\n\nNow, it's time to see if X is a multiple of 14. If it were, then the repeated operation would result in 14 being on the inside, and again, there would be 14 modifications (one for each occurrence of the repeated operation). This would lead to 14 * (14/X + 2) = 4.\n\nSolving for X would give us X = 14 / (1 - 4/14). Calculate this to find that X = 3.\n\nHowever, since we cannot exclude the possibility that 25 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 14, then we must consider the last case of the rule, a※b = 24. This means that 25※X∗14 = 24 * X * 14 because neither 25, X, nor 14 are multiples of each other. Simplifying the equation gives us: 25 * X * 14 = 24 * 196. Solving for X gives us multiple solutions:\n\n* X = 196 / (25 * 14) = 8/11\n* X = 4*196 / (25 * 14) = 16/11\n* X = 9*196 / (25 * 14) = 72/11\n* X = 24*196 / (25 * 14) = 316/11\n\nSince X must be an integer but we only have fractional values as possibilities, those options are not valid and our initial solution (X=3) remains the only viable answer.\n\nTherefore, [[X=3]]."}

In X①3, we perform operation ① on X and 3, which results in the expression \\sqrt{X} + 3^2.\n2. Then, we perform operation ② on the result, meaning we multiply the result by 2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(\\sqrt{X} + 3^2) \\times 2 = 10\n\nNow, we'll solve this equation to find X:\n\n1. Split the equation into two separate equations to deal with the sum and the square part:\n* Equation 1: \\sqrt{X} + 3^2 = 5\n2. Square both sides of the first equation:\n* Equation 2: (\\sqrt{X} + 3^2)^2 = 25\n3. Expand the equation and rearrange:\n* Equation 3: X + 6*3\\*\\sqrt{X} + 9^2 = 25\n* Equation 4: X + 18\\*\\sqrt{X} = 16\n4. Subtract 18*\\sqrt{X} from both sides and then square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\n* Equation 5: X^2 - 324*X = 288\n5. Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n* Equation 6: X^2 - 324*X + 288 = 0\n6. Factor the quadratic equation:\n* Equation 7: (X - 16)(X - 18) = 0\n7. Find the roots: X = 16 or X = 18\n\nHowever, since X is supposed to be the starting variable, we cannot have 3^2 as one of the factors in our solution because it does not depend on X. Therefore, we discard X = 18 knowing that it's incorrect in the context of this question.\n\nSo, the solution to the given question is:\n\n[[16]]"}

Apply the rule: To find f△g at x=0, we have to find the derivative of the composition of f(g(x)) at x=0. Since g(x)=e^x, and derivatives of exponential functions are themselves exponential, we know that g'(x)=e^x. So now we have f(g(x))=x^3 (since f(x)=x^3) and g(x)=e^x.\n\n3.
