Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nUsing Basic Equivalences (14), what equivalent expression is obtained by removing all occurrences of > in (p > q) & (p > !q)?\nThe answer is a logical expression formatted as [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[!p]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the rules, are !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r equivalent?\nA.

Please give a written explanation. (select all that apply)\n1. Each paired conjunctive term or paired disjunctive term corresponds to one and only one number and constant \u00ac.\n2. The main conjunctive and disjunctive normal forms correspond to even numbers.\n3. A paired conjunctive term or paired disjunctive term corresponds to one and only one binary number or constant \u00ac.\n4. God's number can only appear in paired conjunctive terms or paired disjunctive terms.\n5. All-even formula contains an even number of paired conjunctive terms.\n6. All-odd formula contains an odd number of paired conjunctive terms.\n7. All-even formulas are tautology judgments.\n8. For the paired conjunctive terms or paired disjunctive terms of the principal disjunctive normal form, if the binary numbers corresponding to them are different, the judgments corresponding to paired conjunctive terms or paired disjunctive terms in the same number are contradictions.\n9.

In game theory, there is always a player who carries out the plan.\n\nIn short, In abstract logic, there is no player who orchestrates the game, while there is a player who carries out the plan in game theory.\n\n### Question:\nIn which case can we lead the opponents to deviate?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to the fictitious play that a fair-going seller sets the price more than the next fair-going seller will set. This means that using the method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the perfect price by the method of evolution, and the buyer will decide to buy.\n\nThis means that by interrogating the arbitrary part by his method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the best price, at which point the buyer will buy.\n\n### Question:\nIn which two cases, do the neighbors deviate from the price in the arms-race situation, and who do they deviate from in both cases?\n\nPlease, provide your answer in the format [[1/2]].\n\n### Answer:\nAfter several iterations, assuming the maximum price in an expansion in the first round of the game will lead the neighbors at a certain stage to approach the perfect\nprice, so that means the Max Prices, while it is profitable for all the players in the game, it can be rejected by the second or further players. If there is a mistake in information\nit can be rejected. This means that in each case the opponents rejected the maximum price.\n\n### Question:\nWhat distinguishes No-Regret strategies from the limit price strategies?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nNo-Regret strategies, unanimous strategies takes a set of prices between which the buyer could buy at any time during her visit to the market. If the seller deviates from this amount,\nthe buyer can always buy at the previous price, which is more than the current market price. Moreover, our opponent's response is still \"deviant\".\n\nThe Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\nTo sum up,The Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\n### Question:\nIf we want to motivate dozens/ hundreds of thousands of players, what we need essential\nto convey?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe price, the purchase quantity, the payment, and the trade time are the same for all players.\n\nThe problem that arises here is how to implement a market in which all agents use the same non-logic device. One possible answer is social media, which can force agents to engage in the activity and\ncan implement the fourth-factor market.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the advantage of the operating system over the general software on a smartphone?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nWith the growing global population, the lack of resources in different countries could lead to scarcity. Each person will usually benefit from many products; While only few people\nbenefit from many products; However, there might be a lack of resources in different countries which could lead to scarcity. Therefore, the price of the distributed operating system will\nbe higher.\n\nGiven that there are only a few manufacturers of smartphones in contrast to software\nrequiring a big market to work efficiently, the price of smartphones will be higher than the price of software."}

Here are the Legitimate Inferences: \n\n1. PI1: If [the statement is a statement of fact] and in the speaker's opinion [the statement is a statement of opinion], and the hearer is aware of the relationship between truth and opinion, then the hearer can infer that the statement is an opinion statement. \n\n2. PI2: If the speaker makes the statement A, in which content Q2 is included, as well as the reason for making such statement, {Q1, Q2} are not logically identical, and {A, Q1, \u2026} are all conventionally expressed statements, then it must be eliminated the legitimacy of a presuppositional inference [the inference of Q1] from the statement.             (Q1~Q2)\n\n3. PI3: If [the speaker says \u201cshould A\u201d], the action of \"A\" can be inferred from the information that meets the conditions \u201c[the speaker believes that A, A has happened or can happen]\u201d and there is no reason not to do so. \n\nIn this dialogue, the inference of \"Tom\" is established by the combination of \"should\" and \"appoint\" in B's response, and the sentiment indicated by the final word \"should\" strengthens the inference.\n\nWhich principle does this conforms to?\n\nA. The rule of inference using the content of the sentence is completed.\nB. The rule of attribution established by the condition of making the statement is completed.\nC.

In this situation, B needs to deny the overgeneralization represented by the sentence \"All the ships in the harbor are safe\" and believe that someone is asking [A] \"Have the relevant ships near the oil leakage point(s) been saved?\", or assume that from [B]'s perspective, \"The sentence 'X' hasn't spoken.\" The counter-argument here is: \"The truth is that Y is correct.\" It is possible that \"exceptions\" are raised in this way, which can be regarded as contextual inference.\n\nWhich principle does this conforms to?\n\nA.

If the second car was moving faster than the first car, it is not possible that they are not changing location [Note: (4)]{A}. However, if the first car was moving faster than the second car, it is possible that they are not changing locations [Note: (1)]{A}. In this dialogue, if B's response is due to the reason A, then one of the background [notes] would be:\n\n1. They are not driving.\n2. They drive two-wheeled cars.\n3. They are exchange devices such as ambulances.\n4. They drive the same car.\nIn addition to A, B can also make the following inferences:\n\n1. The two vehicles are in the same order, and their front and rear alignments are likely to be fixed.\n2. The two vehicles are following each other in morning 8 o'clock, likely at the same place every day, or incapable of overtaking; \n3. The trajectories of the two vehicles are the same.\n\nBased on these inferences, it can be determined that the LS [presupposition] of \"A\" is very special, not representative, and logically can be regarded as C/E([not] logic) {1-3}.\n\nWhich of the two main LIs in B's text can be cancelled based on the presupposition of \"A\"? They can infer \n\nWhich inference does B use to infer A?\n\nA. (1) Choose one of A.1 to A.4 and cancel all the other presuppositions of \"A.\"\nB. (2) Find other available data to provide for the facts represented by A.\n"}
