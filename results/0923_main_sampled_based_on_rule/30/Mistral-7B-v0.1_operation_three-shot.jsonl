You are not required to find out why. Question: If X#7=3, find X?\n\n## Hint 3:\nEach pair of X#7 indicates that we want X numbers between that pair of X. We only need one X to find the numbers between them if the right boundary == left boundary, in Y#Y = 3?\nTest it out with 4#4.\n\n## Hint 4:\nWhen X#7, the number that #7 returns is a constant that is called average or politely “1#7” or “X#7”. So if you add 7 to both sides of the equation, it becomes X+7#17= 3+7 or X+7= 3+7 which means X#7= 3. Notice that you can also say that “X out of 17 numbers equals average of 3 numbers”. That means if Y #17 generates 3, then X #17 generates the average of those 3 numbers (4 by adding them up (average is (4+4+4)/3)\n\n## Hint 5:\nIf Y#19 beats 10, what it means is that you find 1 number out of 19 numbers equals 10. Those 19 numbers would be 10, 11, 12, 13, …, 19. The number before 10 (in this case 9) would be the answer. Test it out with 22#18: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. The number before 27 is 26, so the answer is Y=26."}

It was first released in 2018 and is designed to mimic human conversations coherently.\nChatGPT is powered by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model from OpenAI. GPT-3 is trained on a massive dataset of Internet text and is capable of generating human-like text on a variety of topics. It can also respond to prompts and engage in realistic conversations thanks to its impressive language processing abilities.\n\nChatGPT uses a technique called \"natural language understanding (NLU)\" to interpret and understand human language. This allows it to respond in a way that is both grammatically and semantically correct, and aligns with the overall context and theme of the conversation.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT incorporates \"embedding\" techniques, which help the model understand the semantic meaning and context of words and phrases. This enables it to generate responses that are not only grammatically correct, but also deeply understand the underlying concepts being discussed and draw relevant conclusions."}
