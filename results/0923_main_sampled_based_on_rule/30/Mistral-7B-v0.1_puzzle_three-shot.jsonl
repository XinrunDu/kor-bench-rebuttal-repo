For the numbers 2 to 9, inclusive, arrange them into a random 6row(rows) and 4 columns(cols) table, in that table all differents correspond numbers form 2 to 9 sit in it in order, and each number is used only once;\n--Stage II. For all adjacent squares(one square can also be a diagonal or vertical square) you can get the following 8 expressions:\n            M+(N&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            A+(M&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            N+(L&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M))\n            E+(C&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (M+S))\n            L+(I&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (O&amp;amp;&amp;amp;K))\n            C+(E&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A+S))\n            I+(J&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (C+O))\n            O+(K&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (IC))\n          Like:\n          M:&nbsp;top&nbsp;left\n          N:&nbsp;top\n          E:&nbsp;left\n          L:&nbsp;right\n          A:&nbsp;top&nbsp;right\n          I:&nbsp;right{中文字成}\n          O:&nbsp;bottom{中文字成}\n          C:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;left\n          S:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;right\n          J or K:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;middle\n\n--Stage III. All of the preceding expressions would be added together, and then divide by 8 as you want; In this process , you must make up some definitions:\n            A---any number not bigger than 8\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n           C2---1+2+3+4+-+-+-|6+7+8+9|5+6+7+8|4+5+6+7\n           C3---6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10|8+9+10+11+12+13\n\n\n            B--&lt;7C1+8C1&gt;|&lt;7C2+8C2&gt;|&lt;7C3+8C3&gt;\n      Like here:\n             a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\n\n--Stage IV. With each candidate (M&amp;amp;&amp;amp;N, A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M, N&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L,  and so forth), use all of the remaining eight local equations to yield nine distinct expressions.\n--Stage V. Out of these 9 equations multiply the right hand and left hand of each equation by any number between 1 and 6, inclusive, and be careful you don&#39;t pick some numbers similar when you multiply 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and so on.\n--Stage VI. The formula that you get is the final expression of your work.\n\n<strong>For example:</strong>\n\n--Stage I\n\n\n\n   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n6  |  7   |  8   |  9   |  10 |\n1  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14 |\n   |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |\n\n--renote:in this example 1 sit in up-left.2 sitin up-right\n\n--Stage II\n\n   |  Stage II    |\n:--|:--|\nM&amp;N&amp;L ---  M+(((N&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nA&amp;M&amp;L ---  M+(((A&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nN&amp;L&amp;E ---  N+(((L&amp;E)/N)+(E&amp;N))\nE&amp;C&amp;M ---  E+((L&amp;M)/(M+S))\nL&amp;I&amp;O ---  L+((O&amp;K)/(A+S))\nC&amp;E&amp;A ---  C+((E&amp;A)/(E+C))\nI&amp;J&amp;O ---  I+((J&amp;O)/(I+J))\nO&amp;K&amp;IC ---  O+(((K&amp;IC)/(C+O))/2)\n\n--Stage III\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n             1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8\n           C2:    1+2+3+4+-+-+-|-+-+-|-+-+-\n\n           C3:           6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14|8+9+10+11+12+13|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14\n\n\n         a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\na+((7c1+9c1)+(3c1+8c1))+(q1+l2+(2182178)/(12131213))++q2\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n--Stage IV\n\n                                 M&amp;M&amp;L ---------  M+(((M&amp;L)/M)+(L&amp;M))\n              AA--- M+((A&amp;M)/M) ------- M+((A&amp;M)/(A&amp;M))\n              NN--- N+((N&amp;L)/M) ------- N+((M&amp;L)/(N&amp;L))\n              LL--- L+((E&amp;L)/N) ------- L+((M&amp;E)/(N&amp;L))\n              EC--- E+((C&amp;M)/(M+S)) ------- E+((M&amp;E)/(M+S))\n              LK--- L+((O&amp;K)/(A&amp;S))------- L+((M&amp;K)/(N&amp;L))\n              CA--- C+((E&amp;A)/(E&amp;C)) ------- C+((A/N)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;((M&amp;L)/N))\n              IJ--- I+((J&amp;O)/(I&amp;J)) ------- I+((O&amp;K)/(I&amp;J))\n              OC--- O+(((K&amp;C)/(C+O))/2)------- O"}

Your task is to fill in the grid with letters according to the given rules.\n\nHere are the rules that need to be followed:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid, and the question is presented in the form of a matrix containing X and 0.\n\n2. The player needs to replace X with letters (fill), and 0 with separators on the grid (separated is not to be filled with letters).\n\n3. Two lists of words are given, across for filling in the words from left to right, and down for filling in the words from top to bottom.\n\n4. During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. However, the letters that cross must match.\n\n5. The question consists of a list of words and a matrix with X and 0 values. The answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped."}
