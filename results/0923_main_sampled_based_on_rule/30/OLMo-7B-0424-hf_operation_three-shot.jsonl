Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. ### Answer: [[29]] ### Question: What are the values of a+1 if 1※a+a = 3? Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. ### Answer: [[0]] ### Question: We define a custom operation: When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2, If b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2, Otherwise a※b = 24, If the given custom operation is not specified in the rule, u= 12. Suppose that B is a number and a= 13※B※6, find B. ### Best answer for offset is 28. To see why is B=28, first compute 13/6 + 6, what b is periodic and what multiplier M for the a is multiple of b. 13/6 + 6=2.8. So periodic divide from 0 to 12 and repeatedly returns 2.8 because 28 = 24 + 4 and 3 or 12. M2 or 12. Since it's a periodic number too, each Mx represents 2^30-2^5=12 times larger values too, so when combined with the original value like 60^3, it is always firstly subtracted 12 times into 60^5, which will lead to M5=1, can be repeatedly used until the value becomes either 0 or the domain limit. Hence after two adjustments equalize b's value and a's value as 1 and find the sequence of numbers for different a's value like [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768] which has analogous results. Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[28]] ### Answer: [[28]] ### Question: Please evaluate (15※36). ### Best answer for offset is 2. To see why is 6, consider 15/36 + 2 gives 3.8. As 15/6 will also return the most significant fraction in the multiplication of 15/6*36. An it is multiplied by 6 too, which returns 6 for 15*6=90. To avoid this effect, need to use the rule option, which rounds down the fraction, so another example: 14/4+2 =2.9 (15.75 of the fraction can be avoided) To see why b is periodic, there are only 3 prime numbers less than 20, 3, 5, and 7. Compute 15051=15×50=3×5×5×7×5=30×5×5. Remove these five factors output 1, which reveals periodic property. Let's take 8, 8. Divide 8 times from 0 to 40. Then the value at 10 will have a period 48-10=38, only 8 or 38 output repeated. And for 20, the values at 2 with offset 14 and 6 at offset 28 will appear in the same way. Hence, 14/9+9 is unique. Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[2]] ### Answer: [[2]] ### Question: Find (3 − 3※2)/2. ### Both a and b are integers. ### Both a and b are integers. ### Best answer for offset is 1. To see why the answer is 7, consider (3949₃※109)/4 = 22"}

The best credit for these contributions is to be given to her kind heart and genuine devotion to the advancement of humankind.\n\n## Short Biography\n\nAnne Chase was born on March 23, 1901 in Denison, Texas. She entered Radcliffe in 1918, going, according to rumors, to escape the WWI draft. In College, Ms. Chase distinguished herself in mathematics and chemistry. Because of her studies, she became an expert in the fields of quantum mechanics and molecular geometry. For reasons yet unknown, she skipped Radcliffe Memorial College and began working at the Harvard Observatory to see the stars. While at RADC, Ms. Chase developed the idea of using the shadows of planets on the sunlight to determine the sizes of the planets. The formulas that she created for the shadows also came to be important to gravitational field calculations, notably Schutz’ well-known j2 series asymptotic expansion for a symmetric mass distribution and Weyl’s r (−1) second antisymmetric mass distribution for tunneling.\n\n### Fundamental Concepts\n\nThe probability for a reaction to occur in a specific direction is defined by the quantity P. It is usually calculated by dividing the difference between the areas of the reactant and product regions with the area of the entire cycle. The probability of the reaction going in a certain direction, if the pathway through which it proceeds is known with high accuracy, is usually expressed as a linear part of P. The P and Q terms were coined in 1955 by BASEL. These terms and other key terms and abbreviations used in this section are inspired by the seminal paper “Some Basic Concepts in Physical Chemistry” [4].\n\n##### Racemic substances\n\nPhysical properties of enantiomer pairs often differ have both high and low  signs. Therefore, technological formulae are based on the degree and sign of the number of N transitions in the  axis.\n\n### Selected References\n\n1. [4] G. Ruscheinery, Enantiomer Asymmetry.

Comprehend the question well enough to potentially provide an answer. Carefully review the rule. If you do not understand something, ask your instructor!\n2. Carefully apply the rule to evaluate your (given set of) answers. The rule is a tool that will take your response(s) and produce an answer value. The generated answer value is likely to be either a \"correct value\" (did you answer the question as the instructor intended?) or an \"error\" (the rule incorrectly calculated something that you know to be true).\n3. Find each of the following:\n• Correct answers\n• Keywords to manually check (red herrings)\n• Other information provided (for further context)\n4.
