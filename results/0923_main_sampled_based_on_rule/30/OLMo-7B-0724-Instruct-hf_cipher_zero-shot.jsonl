We know that the associate letters of A is 3, of B is 5. Now, let's apply the encryption steps to find the corresponding encrypted letters in the affine alphabet:\n\nFor the first character \"V\":\n- Let x denote its position in the affine alphabet, i.e., we'll find x from (Ax + B) % 26. For A = 3 and B = 5, (3 * 19 + 5) % 26 = 17 (mod 26).\n- So, the corresponding letter in the Affine alphabet from position 17 is \"O\" (17 -> 16 -> \"O\"). The encrypted character for V is O.\n\nFor the second character \"E\":\n- Let x denote its position in the affine alphabet, i.e., we'll find x from (Ax + B) % 26. For A = 3 and B = 5, (3 * 14 + 5) % 26 = 19 (mod 26).\n- So, the corresponding letter in the Affine alphabet from position 19 is \"N\" (19 -> 20 -> \"N\"). The encrypted character for E is N.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is: [[\"ON\"]]\n\nNote that the ciphertext \"VE\" decrypts to \"ON\" as the encrypted letters \"O\" and \"N\"."}

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]] (decrypted answer using the specified rules)\n\nHere's how we applied the decryption steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2. For each character c in the ciphertext (in this case, \"INIEIWYUXIU\"):\n   * Find character c on the Reel: \"I\" is on the second position in Reel1, \"N\" is at the fourth position, and so on.\n   * Replace \"I\" on Reel1 with the next character (which is the first character on Reel2): \"O\".\n   * Replace \"N\" on Reel1 with the previous character on Reel1 (which is the last character on Reel1). This is necessary, as \"N\" is at the end of the Reel. Therefore, \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n   * Move to the next Reel.\n\n3. Now we're at Reel2, and all characters \"O\", \"N\", \"E\", \"I\", \"W\", \"Y\", and \"U\" are at the correct positions.\n4. For \"U\" (third character), we go around to the start of the Reel (which is the last character) and come back to the second character (which becomes third in Reel2). Next character in order is \"X\". Therefore, \"U\" is replaced by \"X\".\n5. \"N\" is now at the second position, and it goes around to the start to get the previous character on Reel2. This occurs to be \"E\", so \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n6. \"[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]]\" is the decrypted plaintext. Note that this applies to all characters in the ciphertext, resulting in \"[INIEIWYUXIU]\" becoming \"[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]\". The provided ciphertext indeed decrypts to its plaintext."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[GSP#KAP#X]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Converting the given plaintext \"GSPKAPGX\" to a string of uppercase characters.\n2. The input has 5 characters, which matches the specified number of lines.\n3. Using the \"Downward Fill\" approach:\n   - Fill the first character in the first column of the first row.\n   - Fill the remaining characters in the same row downwards, which gives us \"GSP\".\n   - Move to the second row and fill the first column with \"#\" (removing the first character since it's already filled).\n   - Fill the remaining characters of the second row in the downward direction, which provides \"#KAP\".\n   - Move to the third row, fill the first column with \"#\" (removing first character) and continue downward filling the characters in each row alternately, going up and down: \"#X\".\n4. Converting the filled 5 rows of characters to a single ciphertext string: \"GSP#*KAP#*X\"\n5. Since the original plaintext had 5 characters, adding * signs on both sides of the ciphertext indicates that all 5 lines have been filled: \"GSP#*KAP#*X*\"\n6. Decryption step: \n   - Determining the encrypted data by reading the ciphertext with the \"*\" symbols and dividing it into 5 parts.\n   - Filling the five rows alternately and concatenating the rows: \"GSP # KAP # X\"\n   - Reading the columns alternately, \"G SP K A P X\"\n   - Removing the # symbols, \"GSPKAPGX\"\n\nHence, the encrypted answer is: \"[GSP#KAP#X]*\" (i.e., there must be 5 *'s in the encrypted ciphertext to indicate that there are five lines). The decrypted plaintext is \"GSPKAPGX\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[OCFWT]LIDA]]\n\nThe decrypted answer is: [OCFWTLIDA]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\".\n2. The ciphertext is prepared as per the given encryption rule, where lines with maximum 5 characters and distinct odd and even number of lines are arranged. Here,\n   \n   * Ciphertext \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\" with odd lines arranged in first column: \"O#C#\", \"F#M#H\", \"U#W#\"\n   * Even lines arranged in the second column: \"###T\", \"O#L#D\"\n   \n3. As per the encryption rule, these characters are read column-wise from the top to bottom, appended by a \"#\" per column. Here, this operation converts \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\" to \"O#C#F#M#H#U#W#T#L#D#\".\n4. Now, the decryption process is run, where odd numbered lines are read from left to right and even numbered lines are read from right to left, respectively. Here, these readings form \"O#C#F#M\", \"T#L#D#U\", \"HU#W#\" and \"#\".\n   \n   * The odd numbered lines are converted to \"OCFWT\".\n   * The even numbered lines when converted to \"LIDA\".\n   \n5. Once both the odd and even numbered characters are decoded, they are combined to produce the final decrypted plaintext, which is: \"OCFWTLIDA\"\n6. Hence, the final answer in double square brackets is: [[OCFWTLIDA]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PBXSYAFH\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"AXVXGFAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[Universal Statement of Human Rights, WATER, WEALTH, Solar Electric, Voluntary Simplicity, Geographic Mobility, GREEN HOUSE, Flexible Work Array, Scalable Energy, HealthState, Family, TEAL, Generalized Arbitrage, Emotional Learning, Continuous Localization, Natrual Gas, Renewable Energy Pr approximated, End-to-End Testing, Empowering Behaviours, Bremen, Cleantech Innovations, Basic Needs Satisfaction, Presentient Awareness, Contention, Scientific Methodology, LongTail)]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given ciphertext is \"AXVXGFAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\". Following the decryption rules, we need to divide the ciphertext into two halves, which gives us \"AXVXG\" and \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\".\n\nThen, for each half, we first read the rows and columns of each character and use them to get the encrypted binary. To do this, we will use the 6x6 matrix provided, and we will use the same encryption operation as in the encryption rules.\n\nFor the first half, we have \"AXVXG\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 | 2 | V | (2,0) |\n| 0 | 1 | X | (0,1) |\n| 1 | 2 | A | (1,2) |\n| 1 | 0 | X | (1,0) |\n| 2 | 0 | X | (2,0) |\n| 2 | 2 | G | (2,2) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"AXVXG\" is (2,0)(0,1)(1,2)(1,0)(2,0)(2,2).\n\nTo get the characters after the \"G\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"AXFV\", so the final ciphertext is \"AXFV\".\n\nFor the second half, we have \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 3 | 2 | E | (3,2) |\n| 3 | 1 | D | (3,1) |\n| 2 | 1 | N | (2,1) |\n| 2 | 2 | S | (2,2) |\n| 1 | 1 | C | (1,1) |\n| 1 | 0 | O | (1,0) |\n| 4 | 2 | G | (4,2) |\n| 4 | 1 | O | (4,1) |\n| 0 | 2 | Q | (0,2) |\n| 3 | 0 | T | (3,0) |\n| 3 | 3 | K | (3,3) |\n| 5 | 2 | Y | (5,2) |\n| 5 | 1 | I | (5,1) |\n| 5 | 0 | U | (5,0) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\" is (3,2)(3,1)(2,1)(2,2)(1,1)(1,0)(4,2)(4,1)(0,2)(3,0)(3,3)(5,2)(5,1)(5,0).\n\nTo get the characters after \"T\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"YCIUT\", so the final plaintext is \"YCIUTU\".\n\nThe final answer is then: [[\"Universal Statement of Human Rights\", \"WATER\", \"WEALTH\", \"Solar Electric\", \"Voluntary Simplicity\", \"Geographic Mobility\", \"GREEN HOUSE\", \"Flexible Work Array\", \"Scalable Energy\", \"HealthState\", \"Family\", \"TEAL\", \"Generalized Arbitrage\", \"Emotional Learning\", \"Continuous Localization\", \"Natrual Gas\", \"Renewable Energy Pr approximated\", \"End-to-End Testing\", \"Empowering Behaviours\", \"Bremen\", \"Cleantech Innovations\", \"Basic Needs Satisfaction\", \"Presentient Awareness\", \"Contention\", \"Scientific Methodology\", \"LongTail\", \"YCIUT\"]]"}

The plaintext \"Z\" when converted to its binary form is \"1010\", and when we perform the desired operations as outlined in the encryption rules: \n\n1. Convert each character to binary: 1010 (plaintext \"Z\" in 8-bit binary representation)\n2. Apply the XOR operation: (1010 ^ '10101010') = (00101000)\n3. Apply the permutation table: (00101000) ^ (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) = '10101010' (XOR results after performing permutation)\n4. Convert the XOR results back to characters: 'M' (ASCII 'M' is 131, and '10101010' would yield '131' in decimal form).\n\nHowever, instead of this logic, we follow the given modification with a fixed key: FIRST as an additional step, followed by the encryption operations. After which, we concatenate the first characters of the resulting ciphertext for each character found in the plaintext (\"Z\" results in \"FRSZ\").\n\nIn conclusion, we apply the following steps to encrypt \"Z\":\n\n- Convert \"Z\" into an 8-bit binary representation: '1010'\n- Apply the fixed key (10101010) by XOR operation: '00101000'\n- Apply the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7): '10101010'\n- Combine results for each character: 'FRSZ' is the final ciphertext.

Encapsulating this value within double square brackets yields [[110 10110]].

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[BD7B7B7B]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The plaintext, \"G\", is padded with zeroes to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. Here, the padded plaintext is: \"G\\x00\"\n2. The padded plaintext is divided into 8-byte blocks (or bytes). Here, \"G\\x00\" forms one block.\n3. Block encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: The block \"G\\x00\" is encoded using ASCII to get the byte sequence \"47 00\"\n   - XOR with Key: \"47 00\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" (the uppercase versions of the hexadecimal characters)\n   - Substitute: Using the S_BOX, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, the byte sequence becomes \"BD 7B 7B 7B\"\n   - Permute: In this case, we rotate each byte by 1 bit. So, the byte sequence after rotation is \"7B 7B 7B 7B\".\n   - XOR with Key: \"7B 7B 7B 7B\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: The encrypted byte sequences are converted to hexadecimal string. \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" gets encoded as \"BD7B7B7B\"\n5. Concatenate: All the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks are concatenated to form the ciphertext \"[BD7B7B7B]\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[BD7B7B7B]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]] Explanation:\n\n1. We have given a ciphertext \"4\".\n2. As per the given encryption rules, we have to calculate the decimal value x for each character in the plaintext, by multiplying it with the ascii code of that character.\n3. For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11. Decrypted answer: [\"A\"]\n\nSo, the answer to the given ciphertext \"4\" would be:\n[[\"A\"]]"}

The plaintext we'll use is \"SECRET\" (the recommended key).\n2. Perform SHA-256 on the key (\"SECRET_KEY\") to get the key for encryption: \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\".\n3.

Convert the hexadecimal ciphertext \"5116\" to bytes: 51 and 16\n   2. Decrypt 51 using 51 (key byte) using XOR:\n      * (51 XOR 51) = 0\n(51 XOR 16) = 35 (in decimal)\n3. Decrypt 16 using 51 (key byte) XOR:\n   \n   * (16 XOR 51) = -6\n(51 XOR 16) = 35\n4. The decrypted plaintext from ciphertext \"27ad\" is \"[\"SECRET\"], \"FTH\"."}
