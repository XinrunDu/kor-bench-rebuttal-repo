Now, let's solve for X:   \n\n(X○5) = (X+3*5) × (X+5)).   \n\nTo find X, we need to eliminate the (X+5) terms in multiplication. First, let's think about the factors of 200. We know that 200 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5.\n\nThe next step is to write out all possible combinations of its factors in terms of X. Let's consider the factors expressed as X and 5: (1,10), (2,5), and (5,2). Let's try each of these combinations:\n\n1. X=1, 10○5 = 1 + 3 * 5 = 20. We can see that 20 doesn't actually reach 200, so we move to the next combination.\n2. X=2, 20○5 = 2 + 3 * 5 = 30. We observe that 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 doesn't fit the requested integer conditions. \n3.

Thus, we can determine that there is no integer pair (X, 5) that multiplies with the functions (X○5) to meet the criteria of an integer bigger than 0 and not greater than 5 multiplied by itself. Since we don't have any integer solution for (X○5), we can conclude that there might be no solution (i.e., there's no integer X in this case) that satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe final answer: [[no solution or: there may not be an integer X that satisfies the condition X○5=200]]"}

We have:\n\n`6 ⊕ 3 = 6 + 3i` example with `i2 = -1`.\n\nTo evaluate `6 + 3i + 3 + 3i`, we can use polynomial addition and get:\n\n`6 + 9i + 6 + 6i = (6 + 6) + (3+3)i = 12 + 9i`\n\nSo, `a+bi = 12 + 9i`.\n\nNext, let's find `1 ⊕ 2`. Like `3i`, also `i² = -1`. We have:\n\n`1 + 2i = (1 + 2) + (1-2)i = 2 + i`\n\n`2 + i = 2 + i + 2-2i = 4 - i`\n\nSo, `1 + 2i = 4 - i`.\n\nFinally, to compute `(6⊕3)+(1⊕2)×2`, we apply the operations:\n\n(12 + 9i) + (4 - i) × 2\n= (12 + 4) + (9 +4)i\n= 16 + 13i\n\nTherefore,\n\n`(6⊕3)+(1⊕2)×2 = 16 + 13i`\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n`[[16 + 13i]]`"}
