The goal is to hide the existence of the secret message in the visible parts of the signal such that a human observer is not able to distinguish the signal with and without a secret message. On the other hand, an adversary who possesses the encrypted encrypted message, and a steganogram, is supposed to be able to recover the secret message.\n\nPlease run the following python file for further information regarding the basic principle of Steganography and information on the ``SimpleSampler`` class used in the code.\n\n<a href=\"steg_9.py\">Figure 9: &nbsp; Cipher help for Steganography</a>\n\n<a href=\"steg_10.py\">Figure 10: &nbsp; Sampler for Steganography</a>\n\n### Cipher Help\n\nThe purpose of this help task is to have you implement a simple stegaogram as part of learning from the cipher help module. In this task you will be given a version of ``<NAME>og``'s poem \"It灶s the Scotch again\". Implement the given cryptosystem as prescribed (use RSA). Complete the coherent confusion typography (CCT) steganography algorithm according to Artiniese et al. [40]. For each word, apply a modulo operation on each letter, leading to masking with the relative position identifier for the next letter. For example: For the word 'it', the ciphertext and plaintext are 'ij', and the next letter 'b' is associated with 8 (the 5\\\\.\\ in the word 'it')); if 8 modulo 26 equals 14, then b atrophy be mapped to 'r'.\n\nThe code for the Cipher help will use the ``SimpleSampler`` class which has been provided to you in ``stars[] 40 the following way: a = Sampler().RunSample(word).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- In this Task we will be using RSA RSA encryption and decryption) operation with a simple function!\n- To complete this task, first run `tie40_steg_2.py`:\n    1. You will be prompted to enter a message to be encrypted in the `crypt_phrase` string variable in the `generate():` function. For clarity, the program does not perform any error checking on what is inputted, which may validate in production.\n    2. After locking in your choice for `text_for_cipher`, the program will ask for encryption keys.\n    3. When prompted for the `modulus`, enter the modulus (n) in which you are free to choose. It is working in modular arithmetic, which supports negative number, and not in regular expression.\n    4. After the `p` and `e` keys are injected, input the same `n` key in the `computed_modulus_value` variable which will keep track of your input key calculations.\n    5. You are also prompted to enter a 'text_mask_generator_key' (i.e. the same value for `key` in the constructor).\n    6. The program will then run your set keys and use them in the run sample() function.\n    7. You will be prompted for the next input in the `run_text_smoothing` function and then run the final `text_this_option_number` function.\n    8. The output should be your encrypted ``random`` ends with the suffix '40', 40.\n- Next, open the `bold_love_story.txt` in your favourite editor and copy all of it.\n- Refer to \"task.txt\" to help you work out how to interpret \"It 灶s the Scotch again\".\n- From here, convert the typefaces elsewhere in your text to keep the readable text recognizable.\n- Lastly, paste all of your text in the `sample_to_cipher_and_experiment` function and encrypt it to get the ciphertext.\n\n### Key observations:\n\nThe word 'smoothing' is the key to understanding what to do in this task.\n\n- The RSA approach to this task, is not exactly to perform encryption and decryption. Instead, it involves converting Morley's original poem to Sir Walter Scott using the 'smoothing' operation that we lay out.\n- After understanding the concept, split the string, run the function, and collect your new string. Don't worry about homophonic substitution, it 灶s not necessary to leave it in the written work.\n\n### Question:\n\nPlease provide an encrypted version of the text \"It 灶s the Scotch again\" as encapsulated in a double square bracket: [[encrypted output here]]\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[nsrYTebfgammaofvs}]\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Relevant Content\n\nBelow are the relevant content for the fields of Logic and Language.\n\n### Truth Tables:\n\nThe Truth Table is a mathematical table that takes a certain model or formulation and demonstrates the different types of outcomes, or degree of true-ness. One of the models of a truth table is the ``logical operator table` which separates the logical and phonemic symbols separately. For each column of a truth table, the top most symbol represents a truth value where T=True and F=False, while the bottom most symbol represents a function, with the function being defined per column. In columns 1 and 3, Truth with Logic represents the truth values represented in terms of truth and falsehood, respectively, expressed under logical formal languages within the context of digital computing. As for columns 2 and 4, the function Consider represents conversion of logical value into probability.\n\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1.png\">Figure 1 - Truth Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1.png\">Figure 2 - Function Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 2.png\">Figure 3 - Truth Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 2.png\">Figure 4 - Function Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 3.png\">Figure 5 - Truth Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 3.png\">Figure 6 - Function Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1100.png\">Figure 7 - Truth Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1100.png\">Figure 8 -  Function Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"tables multi.png\">Figure 9 - Functions Difficulty </a>\n\n\n### Alphabet Reversal:\n\nGiven a string of alphabet as context and mixes of symbols, pair it accordingly to form the same string in alphabetical order. For example, given the string ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC as Content, the answer box will display the string ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC in alphabetical order, ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at IPC HTML ABC''. Given the string WHCDZSZXSDB, a substitution needs to be made for the letter ``Z'', which becomes ``X'', to avoid a letter “repeating”. Given the mixed string for exemplify purposes 겔냄탐사I, the answer box will displayაCompareI100'', where ``I'' is replaced by ``:)'' and ``:|’, the letter ``I'' is replaced by the substituted letters with hyphens.. Also note that the trick works for the reversed order of the alphabet. We can name it, but not number convert. For example, given the word “ABC”, the second letter “B” need to be replaced by the first letter “A” because its alphabetical order is different from the given string “ABC”. If the question being “What number is it really?”, we will see the number same as the alphabetical order “1”.\n\nUsing the sentences above, can you help figure out what the following alphabetic symbol is saying?\n\n\n### Question 1:\n\n\"՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥр¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɡҮɧԢ\"\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥر¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɳПAA\n\n### Question 2:\n\n\"֦׋Z֦V֙ȁỨ+/sg%F\"\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n֦׋Z֦V֙ȁȁapes\n\n- [ ] Question 3\n\n### Question 5:\n\noors | theirs | Is | Isaiah\n\n### Answer Too:\n\novan"}

Each of the two models represents a single genetic sequence followed by a heat shock.\n\nGene Sequences\n\nIntensity Data\n\n\n \n\n\nPS: Sometimes it may be counter-intuitive to think that the key to break through the tough biologic problems is to go after high-throughput technology instead of high-precision technology. IW G--- zebrafish development, Keijsers and Wierman V--- budding yeast, Huang EcoRII recognition RNA.  However, high-throughput technology works well for many proteins to sequence the DNA of many organisms, those would not be sequenced otherwise.\n\nIn Crime investigation, high throughput is high-throughput DNA extraction from multiple different crime scenes and dna profile combination.\n\nLinus Pauling invented X-ray fluorescence detection in 1949, allowing chemical analysis of elements in biological cells. Today, X-ray fluorescence analysis is widely used at electron microscopes and at other X-ray instruments.\n\nThe Turing test was an innovation prompted by Turing's interest in assembly languages. For his theory of computing, Turing had assumed an enormous program held in digital memory, from which a program at any moment could in principle be disassembled and archived separately before being reconstructed further on. However, current computer practice, limited memory-space and power-consumption concerns, and his awareness of construction costs for docking stations and repoducing a chain of tools required to construct tool chains led him to modify his original theory considerably. The Turing test tests for \"an essentially mechanical quality\" - \"whether the machine can speak for itself without our knowing it is a machine. He hoped that this might be a practical reality within a dozen years, and alternately predicted only its eventual implementation2 given unlimited computing power and stability bias. Turing wrote:\n\nOur duty now is to provide intelligent machines for the information age. Very great exportability is needed because of the probable feeble growth of intelligence in each country. But equally, I do not see how we can avoid putting our brains together and dismantling the machine by its most relevant discoveries, until in all probability it will prove indispensable to accommodate.\n\nWe have lost the capacity to sort knowledge. The compression of fitting 3,258 books into 250 volumes was a part survival mechanism, although this offered theoretical advantages in communication, universal education, production and distribution. We moved the sky on the stars - at it disappears, our dealers will reach more quickly and effectively to more efficient collection and distribution of goods. We spent <NAME>'s money on factories that automate much of our production by the river, so that the supply of goods could be automated. Now we can produce anything we like where we need it instantly. But we are simply not using it all and it all production is based on efficiency - production costs are still lower than production at any time that it can really understand the nature of its author.\n\n'The question is, can we manufacture this? If not, the factory goes blank; the job's only a few weeks old. Everyone who purchases it once in a century, and hence records a 50% increase in sales, offering an equivalent proposition - is no different. That's your most effective production experts. Indeed, the secret lies in the praise of the multitudes of things. Forgetting what we need to contend with breeding among despair party workers has been an amazing thing. The gross errors made by combining two successful business models have not a small part in striking the common rules, minor bloodzhou.pm.\n\nTaking no pleasure in anything holds your breath ... From the vulture and gaining strength slightly, but if this happened, it was passed on to the aged and rich. Start by doing what is necessary to be done. In your life, I do much you-sizing and don't do a lot of other, messier stuff. Another track in this series: God descends, cutting off the bodies from boulders in a vortex that looks like a secreting throat. His buzz increases as the pigs under the swamp otters type in to hear for the attention of a bus..."}

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

One unique security concept that is a matter of heated debate among security experts is the use of pre-decryption keys (PDKs).\n\nLet's start by generating a ciphertext (note that encryption is a one-way process that does not provide a reverse-aware path) based on some plaintext input. We accomplish this using the [DOB stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobell_sky_generator).\n\nTo generate a ciphertext using the **stream cipher**:'\n\n```\nlet child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14]))\nlet data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\ndata = data.concat(child_random);\n    \ndobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertexth\n```\n\nIt would be best if you calculated the keyword input to this cipher in the previous question. The result should look similar to this:\n\n**Ciphertext**: VVIHNAQ&A.L{RN{Hv%34r{H,cA_!+}.\n\nLet's analyze this communication before the pre-decryption combinator. An overview of the algorithm components is below:\n\n![cipher-formajoingte](https://i.ibb.co/N6NTzhP/cipher-formajoingte.png \"cipher-formajoingte\")\n\nIf we look at the char-by-char correspondence in this system, we can see that each character is encrypted using a predictable method within an arbitrary field, which we call the *afield*.\n\nIn practical contexts, when decrypting such messages, you will often face a situation in which the _key matrices_ have only been derived through knowledge transfer from long-dead individuals. For such messages, the only significant difference between decrypting and encrypting is that you first need to recover the pre-decryption key (PDK) used to derive the afield before using the encrypted plaintext to predict the next afield. You will subsequently employ this approach to recover the PDK used by the sender for all further afields.\n\nTo decrypt the afield, obtaining the PDK (as discussed in [Challenge 7: Communications and Pre-multiplication](https://github.com/NorseAS/esummit_cs21/tree/main/crypto-sprint_lab6)) will result in valuable insights into the written rather than spoken language in transit. By learning the PDK, one can accurately and expeditiously translate the afields. The pollket algorithm is designed to accommodate such values and provides processes for identifying and measuring afields without relying on having illegal disclosure with the previous matrix prior to commencing decryption.\n\nA crucial aspect of this system is the parity of the afields before and after decryption. The pollketalogy process uses the ROT-13 (round-and-fifth-key chaining) method to ensure that different plaintext sentences need not be statistically identifiable. This process of encryption is utilized in ensuring that the PDK is harmless to the decrypting entity. By infection-testing protocols, the pollket (which has evolved into the polket) can be incredibly difficult to compromise by network entities and is often run on devices connected to central firewalls that limit the possibilities of attack and compromise. The polket thus provides superior encryption services for messages, using a master readkey consisting of raw bits that is constructed by the filter for securing data transmission between different groups across an industry.\n\n## Objective\n\nYou will modify the stream cipher algorithm to decrypt a given key going out for $\\leq N$ many NB positions and only $\\leq k$ bytes. The rationale for this task is to study how to manipulate and decrypt the ciphertext using a PIN, which will reduce fraud and theft in money transfers over air. By utilizing a secretcam system, you'll only need the straight-forward visual representation explained here to decrypt the ciphertext to the original plaintext message.\n\n\n### Challenge:\n\nCreate a function **decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey**_N**_k_** that decrypts a ciphertext according to the previous algorithm. Additionally, using the pre-decryption key, apply standard decryption for $\\leq $ N many ciphertext positions; instead of encryption, calculate the Minny-A value of the plaintext utter output decrypted $\\leq k$ bytes.\n\nThe flow chart below illustrates the steps a polynomial HTTP message in the process of decryption:\n\n![decrigvahovadcbrh](https://i.ibb.co/dThjf58/decrigvahovadcbrh.png \"decrigvahovadcbrh\")\n\nYou may choose to invert and pass the message bits to make the legalization of each polynomial mathematics somewhat simpler. In JavaScript, this might be accomplished with an *if statement*, a *for loop*, and an array of polynomial values.\n\nIf you name your public decryption key fret, your decryption function will look similar to this:\n\n```\n//Modified for num positions and key bytes.\nfunction decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey(_N_, _k_) {\n  let child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14])\n  let data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n  \n  data = data.concat(child_random)\n  dobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertext;\n}\n```\n\n### Challenge Goals:\n\n1. You got 100% of the private and public key combo produced by the **pollket** Algorithm, a cipher from which you will never break. This was made possible by a beautiful pillow layout-diagram complete with placing all objects in the position of their correct architectural elements. The *parity cipher* was used in"}

I open up dictionaries provided in Bundy and came across 6 words in the [ACM G] and couldn't teach it immediately. I encoded the dictionaries and added multiple layers and non-alphanumeric characters, as well as the ACM G, which I had extracted from the provided docx file.\n\nI kept a leveled list of words with as many level as possible and searched for the Crypt, thinking it's just a long message. I tried a feedback approach with a two-step recursion but was unable to perform the 100th recursion (definitely without intent) because my internet was very slow. I tried an approach within the first few lines of code to access the message without storing the state as too many states cannot get stored in the memory when there are ~1M states, and 24 bits or 288=26^2 = 3^12 = @2^39 = over 7REELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLllllllllllxxrAD). Therefore, I decided to work dynamically, create a set of rules based on the ACM G and handle incompatibilities through nested quotes or stored words.\n\n## Concept:\n\n<!-- ## Specification -->\nNested quotes are first made in ascending alphabets. Non-alphanumeric characters make the last successive asterisk in a word unchanged. FILL in the blanks and check the concepts to understand the last line.\n\n~~~\n\"hard'-chainc'king {-a>'/co'-dEmpty*!--changc'kend{***!^^b\"*!!}s\"and hardest '\"***    ^^^^ !^!^!! ^^ !^ ! !^ !^ !^!*** ^^^^ !^!!^*!'*You're very good ** 'And hard to get**\n~~~\n\nExecution begins with the 'A' level, which is the longest one attempting to form 'alphaks' to prevent blanks to form in confusion. If there are '__some-begin_+__' and '_begin-some_+', they both get adjusted, and 'some-begin_+' becomes '__some-begin_+'. If the '__some-begin_+' does not preserve before 'some-begin' or 'begin-some', there are no problems. Now we make the 'some-begin' word longer. Since it has received the extra position from 'begin-some_+', it's both progressive to subsequent ones or no change in a word of both letters. If the previous word retains a blank, 'some-begin_+' becomes an extra position than 'begin-some_+'. Otherwise, begin-some_+ is incorporated into begin-some-begin-some-begin....., hence leading to incompatibility. When we consider the incompatibility, we replace the viewed word in the cache with blanks. Finally, when an incompatibility occurs, which is appended into the 'begin-some_' word from previous levels. It forms FILL in the blanks and insert that word \" h\" last.\n\n<!-- ## 20 Bad-skillful-skillclasses headed C'measled Jousted of Carols Burbled Haversine :(Kirrsacthese Crockings 'ANSAT ABOSD CGN CSEEXMF GISD CBMCD NNSFIL NBYUB SYSSII TFIF DIMRI MTLC AE' ABPAS LFNIV FIDL DNFPRP FFNIB TFUNT SFTPE LAHPMU BHTTQ TLTVM IDTTA GLEPT LSPSO AFODA FULLN FFNIB FFNFN NNNRB TFNTN TNTFV NNNTM NSTFM NSSTN NTTFE NNTTB MNNBA ARRMA TRBTA TEACM TCASP EHTQA NTCAV TNASC ETCSD SNFCN\n[acg6] > {{b' & now '\n```{error} 77```\n\nTherefore, for implementing recursion, we have to save the sentence and store its end and continue inside the input argument. -->\n\n## Code:\nProbe implicative errors before running:\n~~~\n8([(('wid)) -> MolecularEscola::EncryptionTitle) which expects 80, but LazyLines::Commander predicts 80. > 3^3 == LazyLines::Journey > 672; 357; 180] ~~>>>; &['>~'; Right; Right; Right]\n~~~\n\n{{:speed-four-puzzle.pd:}}}}}}}}\n\n<!-- ## Upcoming Category -->\n\n~~~\nC2C3ECgADg4nC4bNeuC0fQ2iZ\n~~~\n\n## Theory:\n\n{{default.png}}\n\n<!-- <!-- ## Execution --> -->\n\n## Analysis:\n\n~~~{{={{:speed-np.pdf:speed-np}}}~~~~~~~ mmm 4 magic hey/ refresh}}]}\n~~~\n\n#### 1.0.0b Gen, Agg, and Imp.\n\n## Practise 🤫\n\n<!-- ## Questions -->"}

When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"XNARZKEM\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext:\n        - Plaintext Format: A Plaintext String consists of a prefix, an operator, and a suffix. The prefix is conventionally expressed as an uppercase letter (R-Z). The operator may be Reg, Ver, or Ind and can be any of the 26 letters in the alphabet (A-Z). The suffix is any integer from 0-5 and represents many compounds and individual entities formerly known as the Non-Reggae Section.\n    - Hexadecimal decoding converts 0 to 0x20, 1 to 0x21 ... 10 to 0x30 ... A to 0x41 ... B to 0x42 ... C to 0x43 ... D to 0x44 ... E to 0x45 ... F to 0x46, a to 0x61, b to 0x62, c to 0x63, d to 0x64, e to 0x65, f to 0x66.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A Hexadecimal String representing its encrypted data.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A key is used over several plaintexts and is randomly picked from 0-26, 3-48, random permutations of the 26-letter alphabet, composition of prefixes, operators, and suffixes, and operators and inflections.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Hexadecimal Encoding: The plaintext is converted into hexadecimal. This requires the plaintext to be 6 letters long in the case that the second and third letters in the plaintext do not match.\n<text>Hexadecimal Encoding</text>\n    2. XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the hexadecimal cipher and the fixed key.\n<text>XOR Cipher</text>\n    3. Pad the cipher to make its length divisible by 6: If the cipher is not a multiple of 6 letters long, append padding bytes to make it so. Assume that the padding bytes are always greater than the cipher in length.\n<text>Pad Hex Cipherlength</text>\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: The padded cipher is converted back into hexadecimal.\n<text>Hexadecimal Encoding</text>\n    5.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces, where A-Z is used for letters.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:\n        - Concatenated 8-bit hexadecimal hex pairs (eg. 0801), representing the ciphertext data.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed shared secret: b'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC', using b' ' for null characters. The 'shared secret' is a 64-char long binary string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Ralph Smith (Smith Suite): This is an 8 round feistel network.\n        1. Concatenate the plaintext and the shared secret, (ie: a space where the shared secret starts). Use ASCII encoding.\n        2. Determine the message length in bytes, and then round up to an even integer.\n        3. Perform the following rounds:\n            1. Generate a Substitution Box.\n            2. Format the Substitution Box; this relies on the message length.\n            3. XOR the Substitution Box with the planeMR\n            4. XOR the Reversal S-Box with the planeMR\n            5. XOR the Output S-Box with the planeMR\n            6. Swap the left and right halves of the planeMR.\n        - Need to determine the message length and round it up to an even integer to use the formatSubtractionBox function. This function removes the need to have an exact number of bytes in the input string.\n        - After the final round, the plaintextMR is no longer plaintext, it is CiphertextMR.\n    1. Ralph Smith (Smith): This is a 8 round a Feistel network.\n        1. Fz = E(Cz,Mz-1)\n        2. Pz = (Pz-1)^Fz\n        3. Qz = Pz CF(Qz-1)\n        4. Mz = Pz Fz\n    2. Restore plaintextMR from CiphertextMR using IRB (inverse Ralph block).\n    3. Restore plaintextMR from CiphertextMR using SPCR (split pencil rectification).\n    4. XOR \"Shared Secret\" on plaintextMR with the encoded shared secret.\n- Decryption:\n    1. Ralph Smith, LivePair (Smith): This is the exact reverse of the single RLS (technically known as the Light-Pair Mode), but applied more times in order to increase randomness. This works by increasing the number of iterations, so that an algorithm randomly changes after every round to prep for the next. For the purpose of decreased difficulty in breaking, the starting box is modifying from decryption to encryption 3000 times, to have the highest probability possible for intermediate states to receive the key.\n        - Ralph Smith (LivePair): A 8-round Feistel network, which works from EMR Reader:\n            - After the final round, the plaintextMR is no longer plaintext, it is CiphertextMR.\n    1. LivePair (Smith): Undo the process of RLS. This is the same as the original encryption except with repeating the William Sparks Step (described above), and instead of removing it after each round, it keeps the step so that each iteration of the step applies newer variants of the step.\n    2. Extracting EMRs: At the end of LivePair (Smith), the EMR and CMR are available for reading/decryption.\n    3. Calculate CMR: At the end of LivePair (Smith), the CMR contains the ciphered charactersi. Revealing the characters function retrieves a plaintext character given the EMR. This function takes EMR and character numbers. Comparing it to the CMR give the final plaintext characters (C))$^3_8$. Discounting the fact that every time a character is revealed, another is also revealed so the CMR is only 45 characters long, instead of the original 52 characters in the shared secret (as in half = 26 (A-Z)).\n    4. Finding Jacobi Signature: After LivePair (Smith), flip half of the characters and replace the shared secret with an emulate shared secret. The first XOR is of the flipped letters, before switching the order of the letters and adding the original (half) to that. This is inadequate as an encryption output since it has exactly the same condition as the original input text. In order to convert this to information that can be used as an encryption key, one separate encryption needs to be repeated on a related pair of share-secrets (in separate halves of a test set) using the appropriate prior iteration of the output from LivePair (Smith). Given a pair of such pairing ciphers, that generates the new encryption (common shared secret), the function can be used twice to decrypt the overall set. Due the inverse relationship between Jacobi Signature and ECC (Efficient Crank Control"}

It has 7 digits that are exactly 9,7,4,1,8,6,2 but to use the other digits there are 3 more. For example:\n\n\n0-1 => new solution; for (n: 17..    | new solution; for (i: 0001..100000) { if (i % 3 == 0) print(i); }\n\nWhere the differnce is between the right and the left column.\nBy matching these columns, we can get more than one solution.\n\n\n\nNow that we know the difference within the columns, we know that anycase that is the same last digit will solve that case. Both the case where we divide a number by 7 and give the remainder 6 => 2 digits are the same. The next case is the same, but the difference being 8 1 4 and the last case is 7 3 -1 and 8 4 1.\n\nLets say I A} is the first case, B} the second => A}}\\B}\\A B A} \nWe know that: B is always the answer since the answer should be different to solve A. The answer now is B} Fortunatelly, the case is A」 }^G G -4 \nA}}{»G G -4 ----|\n\n{C\n\nThe strategy for next time is to pair A and B as they are always the answer for 9 and 7 and when the pairs that are the same go to the same surpluss, the answer would be G since each pair is differente and the case will be different. A} for the 1 and 6 cases where the numbers are different and a row with the same number and the answer will be the answer that has the last digit that is different. The two cases with 4 and 5 are the same, So it has to be 4 so far. Since the difference if 4 more or less, knowing that there is a difference, we know which cases are not the answer. The answer is 7.\n\n\\GBALFL\n\nGBCAHDCFDSDBTB\n\n\nEach third row is a different number, so where we have a number, the rest will be the same.\n\nABGBBFBCAGDLLAGBBCAGDL\n\n\nWhen we divide by 3, the number is bigger than any of the numbers in the synor, so its the A.\nABPGBPAPBFREE\n\n\nBy dividing the number by 2, we get the 2.\nABPGBPAPLBA\n\n\nAnd since the ABC share the same last digit, we get G.\nABGPABGBABCAPAA\nIn general, starting from 0 and going to 9, we get the following number 9,8 ,7,7,1,0,0,1,3,6.\nIn general, when we divide by 9, we have the same left and right value. So the number that is larger left than right value should be the answer since that means that we are not matching the case, which is B. We then go down to 6. What we get when we divide by 6 is that. We get 5,2,1,9,5,6. And since the first digit in the last cases is bigger than any other in the series, we know that the answer is G.\n\n9476536}6\n\nIn the general highlighted series first value of last case is larger than in the second case, So we just have to the last value which will be the answer since it will be the same but not match. In this case, we have 0,0,1,3,6 which means in order to"}
