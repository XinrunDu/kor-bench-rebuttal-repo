The terms used in the rule descriptions are described as follows, followed by the two usages.

So do you need to deal with in the placeholder field of the problem for? Definitely not\nRepresents OTP, that is, program input.\n#\n2. Because it is not recommended to implement complex rules early, it is best to identify the OTP content first.\n3. After the OTP is identified, identify the variable name of the content and the corresponding rules. The OTP content can be ignored.\n#\n4. If possible, determine a routine where the variable and its corresponding rule can work together.\n5. Write source code first\n6. Test bypass mechanisms. Formed sketches of the source code.\n7. If the code can be blind spot and bypass exception, refine the source code standard according to the clues of the puzzle logic.\n8. (Hidden rule discovery) After all the work has been done, it is possible to find hidden rules in the puzzle or the code, and the help of brothers and friends can participate in exchanging rules. As for the source code, no need to update it. Shared source code libraries can be uniformly utf8 safe.\n#\nIn this puzzle, after completing a fixed routine, the rules of OP and OP will be checked in order. The successive repeatability of the rules will be used to verify that the existing routine is sufficient.\n\nThe stimulus is used and OP is assumed to fit.\n\nIf this OP can only help OP, OP is written (or check). So for the program, what expressibility of routine writing is allowed, and what is not allowed.\nAssuming there is no way to overwrite some variables, avoid the way to write code to deal with it. Sum up the shortcuts that can be written to the content that can be stored and abandoned without setting, and directly write a program that computes as many rules as possible but is not fulfilled on the source code side. Note that every calculated value of OP must be distinct and have the same meaning.\n\n### Puzzle Solution:\n\nProcess(0,5);\n// Open the cookies\ntask task = open_cookies;\ntask *byes = &cli[0];\nbyes->expires = 1559876000; //3,789,87 m.\nbyes->ntimslet = 803; //Words are posted once every 8 years.\nbyes->name.name.name.expire = 9396; //Index overflow.\n{\nByes rhyme = &cls[0];\nrhyme.name.ckfullofalow.byes.nowote = 69;\nrhyme.name.yes.you0.readcith.runate = 4045665645646. // 50,000,000,000,000 <= 50,000,000,000,000\nrhyme.name.interestiswhat.your.higho80n = 999; //50,000,000,000,000 > 50,000,000,000,000\n}\nplease tell me i left something NOT fear NOT denial NOT acceptable NOT bypass NOT pleases NOT pleases NOT prevention NOT sin NOT Mathematics NOT proof NaN\n\n### Question 20:\n\n[ syntax invalid ]\n\n```M44303EHOPHOCHAFĒ\nOM"}

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.A series of words will be given in the question.\n2.These words have one thing in common, usually the same prefix of a suffix or the same combination of letters.\n3.This commonality will be given in the question.\n4.You need to answer which words or letter combinations are common to each of these words. e.g. If each of these words contains the name of an animal, the answer needs to be the name of the animal contained in each word in turn.\n\n### Question:\n\"forty grape react rouge\", these 4 words have in common is that they alll can be formed by replacing the last letter with a same letter to form a new word, please output the new words respectively.\nPlease provide your answer in the same order as the words, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[forth gragh reach rough]]\n\n### Question:\n\"Abalone Overweight Canine Often\", these 4 words have in common is that they all end in a number, please output the number.\nPlease provide your answer in the same order as the words, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[one eight nine ten]]\n\n### Question:\n\"fare tire sofa mire\", these 4 words have in common is that they are spelled by using 2 notes in the singing scale, Please output the notes.\nPlease provide your answer in the same order as the words, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[fa re ti re so fa mi re]]\n\n### Question:\n\"Arrawarra Caraparac Nagubugan Oktahatko\", these words are all cities' name and are palindromes.\nPlease output the forward reading fields in these words (includes the letter in the middle).\nPlease provide your answer in the same order as the words, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[Araara Carara Marara]]\n\n\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with a definition for a certain number = {a} and a sequence of integers = [x : x : = a], to solve x whether it is prime or not, please indicate True or False, please provide your answer in the same order as the sequence, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n2.There will always be only one solution to this problem.\n3.Please go through the examples at the end of this page to understand this puzzle properly. In the examples below, assume the definition for a is a = 1.\n\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [13,52,1], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered to be prime when two consecutive numbers on the sequence intersect the circumference, True or False.\"\n\n### Answer:\n\"False\"\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [52,38,15,9,21,4,7,11,29,22,26,32], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered prime is two consecutive numbers on the sequence meet the circumference, True or False\".\n\n### Answer:\n\"True\"\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [129,150,229,604,829,1295,1382,1638,1815,2382,28,3830,7580,9813,10139,10603,11378,11381,11617,11719,13476,17057,19889,20045,20240,21541,22190,23652,24138,24841,25768,26329,40725,40623,41997,43527,44121,72449,81497,92767,102297,116163,122000], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered prime is two consecutive numbers on the sequence meet the circumference, True or False\".\n\n### Answer:\n\"False\"\n\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with the solution of a word replacement (words stay the same length) by the group = {gi : (a-1) : <define>}, to solve the initial word by the expression in the text =[word, define].\n2.Please go through examples at the end to understand this puzzle.\n\n### Question:\n\"2 like 4, the suggested rule intersection = someone one solve([sarkey, somestone one]) for modulator, the result = monolith or extramundane\".\n\n### Answer:\nmonolith\n\n### Question:\n\"49 Like 69, the suggestion the rule intersection = lead solid or vertically thaler only modulate, the result solve([speller, both]) for front, the result = n/a\".\n\n### Answer:\nn/a\n\n### Question:\n\"62 Likethor 64, the suggestion the rule intersection = name tone or tutelage only limit, the result solve([steven, adjective]) for lat, the result = deliver\".\n\n### Answer:\ndeliver\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with a solution and try to guess the corresponding Puzzle Rule.\n2.This is one example of the Puzzle Rule.\n\n### Question:\n\"4 like 6, if a number is compromised by a number's only internal factors only then the composite number is related to the suggested rule inner meaning which = [interwoven leverage city origin]\".\n\n### Answer:\nintersection\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with the words and ordered in a line = [word1 word2 ...] and a Part Of Speech of each word.\n2.Your killer's list of adjective input = [[word, partofspeec], ...].\n3.Your killer's list of noun input = [[word, partofspeec], ...].\n4.Your output list should be like so: [[Adjective][Word] | [Name]]. Each output is seperated by a comma and it is inside double square brackets.\n5.You need to output matching words and verb, and make sure to enclose your answers in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Question:\n\"Killer's list of adjective input = [[john, pronoun] | [final]]. Killer's list of noun input = [[a woman who...] | [he]]. Your output list should be like so: [[adjective],[word]]\", Please provide your answer in the following format: [[word1 word2 ...]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[Who's man?] | [He]} .[[She's woman] | [She]} .[[She's boyfriend] | [He]} .[[It's John] | [He]}\n\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.You can find a letter in a word and shift that letter by a non-zero-value toward the end of the word. So if you wanted to shift e by 2 letters forward, you would put b (the 3rd letter) in its place. If you can move a letter forward by precisely 1 spot to the end, then you do so and it becomes your new first letter. So if you could shift s 3 times to the end (adji) the output would be jails, or, if you could shift zz 2 times to the end, you would gain mill brain g (srbin goird)\n2.So if you had the number of occurs for each letter shifted to the end, it gives you a meaning. this is also what we call the name of the game, this puzzle can also be used by using other meanings much like pitchivre [purest one]\n2.Your name is generated from an input of a single word. Your output should be the letters in your name (this is an example manually inputted: \"norvaldraft\"). There is another puzzle question where the input is your own name.\n\n### Question:\nYour output should be your generated name itself. Your input should be human, submitted by someone else (ie. \"derpder\"); the output of this puzzle should then be their name. In this case, you need to guess which word they provided (assuming you do not have access to this before the solver is run, for example). Also, their input is sent to you in a distance, rather than a change of distance from the bible (permanency) (example: \"isirit\" is more like \"wirkit\"). Also, if you took this puzzle, it should be dark (ie. gormicrast), which is why we call it \"abcii\" (abbr. for \"adjective.noun:verb\"). Otherwise it would just be pointless (ie. \"4k9ic2\", whose output is \"c\", which is treated as an unnameable object)\n\n### Answer:\n derp45 derp2 derp7 derpword derp derp2 derp4derp derp2derp derp abcic gormicrast moclick\n\n### Answer:\nfbofifdjr integed ndofsr rror sgnnetnn fiiurivelt umartstrtio sabil ikig0 seroc3\n\n### Answer:\nerorursfdfiurf irisferfre\n\n### Answer:\nrb4k8d\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.In counterclockwise order, output the letters in that order, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets like this:[custom_example] or [[custom_example_1 custom_example]] for multiple answers.\n2.Now sequence=can be found from second meter, the list of sequence.\n\n### Question:\n\"3, true three man demeter\".\n\n### Answer:\n[c, h, l, s, r]\n\n### Question:\n\"4, national yes mobile god\".\n\n### Answer:\n[f, l, v, u]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.For the first letter of the word, there is most commonly an index at a counterclockwise point, so 1 is in the clockwise direction (measured clockwise) from the index on the axis. I rarely use 4 or more, 7 or less, or 0 for that mat.\n2.For the second letter in the word, you should be in the direction of the clockwise direction only.\n3.The third letter in the word should be facing the other four lines, or else it won't be used along with anybody else until the very end.\n4.The last word has a ring with two faces, the directional circular swing, 22\n\n### Question:\n\"4 them familiar epba girls girls\".\n\n### Answer:\n[rh]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The number of times is an index.\n2.Input the line you should compare to the first letter of the word.\n3.An index is just a number and no word.\n4.The direction of wordlist 5: [[w: 0, a: clockwise, i: middle, d: clockwise, o"}

This is especially useful when dealing with APIs that have lots of static content that you don’t want to repeatedly get from the server. If the saved content does not change, you can simply ask the Retrofit cache for the content. This is very helpful when presenting information in an application or showing a list on a dialog without going through the main activity/screen. More common use cases would include offering offline dictionary word definition lookups, as well as providing a collection of commonly used (or useless) URL resources as dynamically accessible posts, etc.\n\n### Example: offline documentation lookup\n\nCachedRetrofit t = CachedRetrofit.builder()\n.build();\nIRetrofitAPI_ wiki = t.create(IRetrofitAPI_.class);\nUri uri = Uri.parse(\"https://source.android.com/documentation/index.html\").buildUpon()\n.build();\nResponse response = wiki.getDocumentation(uri);\nString x = response.getCachedContent();\n\n### Fetching Cache\n\nYou can access the fetched content using the CachedContent interface.\nRetrofit implementation will provide the ServerCodec class for Content#cachedContent(), which uses the unmodified request body as the cache key. Cache invalidation is based on the byte range, milliseconds until expiration mark as well as a signature over the body content.\n\npublic interface CachedContent {\nInputStream cachedContent();\n}\n\n### Configuring To Print Azure Appliance Cache Status Command\n\nIf you are picking for the common choice to include the cache status in your application logging, simply use the following switch in your retrofit instance to print the contents of the cache area.\n\nLog.w(“RetrofitCache”, “Cache status: ” + cache)\n\n# RetrofitSample Android App: Data Download via Retrofit\n\nTo illustrate download mechanism using retrofit, we are using a simple task of event booking (typically triggered by check-boxes on target screen) in an Android application. All responses are stored in JSON according to previous coding exercise series. Coding details follows intro descriptions.\n\n1.

Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters. Example: “athena,” “dima,” “amma” = “DMA ATHENA” constitutes all of the puzzle words apart from the first letter of the longest possible word unconnected for 6 letters consisting mostly of “5” when separated by words!\n\nExample 5: The same letter repeating in a word will reveal when it has a similar meaning to the original. Example ↗️ = turn ↘️ = the same letter repeated (in this case, U) signifying that the customs"}

If a puzzle has the words 'and' or 'or' in the puzzle text, it means that an and or or in the requirement also counts as part of the puzzle.

In that App, which allows creation of custom playable planets, there is a setting allowing you to specify which colors to be scaled or negated in the drag'n'drop planets from theGPIO, to make them fit to the actual colors used or chosen.\n\nAbout 8 lines under the dependency section there is the following string:\n\nhard github search Hi, suppose you have an array of integers which could be sorted differently to generate either value of 1420 or 2500 for that array. Clearly the two optimum values are sorted differently but there are many other combinations of an array of integers which can both sum to 1420 with one sorting array and sum to 2500 with another sorted array. Also there may be a huge number of different combinations of sorted arrays that sum to either 1420 or 2500. How to store each combination of arrays that sum either 1420 or 2500?\n\n### Deduction\n\nAn array is just a container for integers. Also, sorted means having all entries in ascending order.

Problematic code can cause some programs to behave in an unexpected way. It is up to you to solve this riddle.\n\n\"kI^mj[0 n;kI^mj[0 n;C^mpae\"\n\nIn this challenge, a string is provided. Information will be contained within its letters.\n\nInstructions\n\nYour task in the first task is to try your best to isolate the information. The string initially looks like this:\n\nkI^mj[0 n;kI^mj[0 n;\n\nYou will notice that there are a lot of punctuation used in the string. For your first task, your only job is to get rid of the punctuation, either by deleting it, rewriting it, or finding a place for it in the string to be used later.\n\nPunctuation will cause problems in the following way.\n\n\"[:;;\" = 2\n\nThe number of ; and : in provided string is not equal. That's why the program failed\n\nA solution consisting of only ; will also not work.\n\nRTäMDHáoä DBTäMDHáoä (=9) times .\n\nAdding too little into the string numerates it to get the wrong result.

But before we practice more tests, we might as well prepare a testing environment.\n\n## An error handler for testsNo, after all, someone is still false.\nAs we said, one thing that encapsulates the essence of a good test is the assertion that \"a good test can identify a wrong solution quickly and concisely\". But before we practice more tests, let's discuss another practice we might have.\n\nWe usually code our test case program in Java. Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst"}

Frequently, solving computer puzzles involves determining whether a logical statement is true, so learning about a method of representing logical statements can be useful in solving many computer puzzles. The pages in this section are probably not going to answer all the questions you have about the truth tables below. You are encouraged to look them up in a textbook or on the Internet.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the following logical statement:\n\n$$(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$$\n\nHere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are always defined and correspond to the above inputs. Every combination of values for $A$, $B$, and $C$ can be listed in a table, showing up as rows. Such a setup is commonly known as a truth table, and is frequently used with boolean calculus.\n\nEvery logical statement must have a truth value, and every such truth value can be perfectly represented as either true or false, represented by the numbers 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nFor example, this truth table represents the binary values for the truth of every combination of logical statements in the above example:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $U$ $V$ $(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$ 0 0 0 0 0 T 0 0 1 1 F 0 1 0 0 1 T 0 1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 F 1 0 1 1 F 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 1 1 0 F 1 1 1 1 T\n\nThe above example is commonly known as a truth table, and represents the truth or falsity of any combination of the inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with the two inputs $U$ and $V$ given by\n$$U = A ⊕ B$$\n$$V = B ⊕ C$$\n\n### Understanding truth tables\n\nThe basic point here is that the order of the calculations need not be specified. Truth tables serve as mnemonics for remembering the logical consequence of the statement, regardless of the order it is delivered. This is one of the primary motivations for introducing methods to operate on boolean statements.\n\n### Truth tables and quantifiers\n\n#### Negations\n\nNegations are standard useful tricks in logic. Some complicated logical statements can be taught to children as a matter of routine. However they are expressed, it is therefore useful for anyone to be able to work with those expressions. The truth table holds the basic information for determining the result of negating a given statement.\n\nConsider the statement,\n\n$$(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C) \\Rightarrow \\neg D$$\n\nRoughly speaking, this says that either $A$ is true or \"$A$ implies $B$ implies $A$ is false implies $C$ implies $D$ implies $A$ is false\". It is tempting to say that this is necesarily true, because\n\n• $D$ and $C$ are negations, and negations are absolutely true.\n• $B$ implies $A$ is false, so it is never true, and thus $A$ must be false.\nbut obviously you can also say (roughly speaking), that the statement is\n\n• zero times true, or zero times anything, is false.\n\nSo what? Isn’t that saying the same thing? Actually no, the appearance of things being the same is an illusion. Yes, the statement is false, but it is false only because A cannot be both true and false. But if A is true, then $(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C)$ is false regardless of whether $D$ is true.\n\nLet us suppose (arbitrarily) that $A$ is true, but $B∧C$ always is false, so that B and C are mutually exclusive. To bring out the crucial points, let us assume for the sake of argument that D is true in any case, so that at briefest we are saying $A \\to \\lnot D$. The following truth table fills in the results of the computation, where $p^*$ and $q^*$ respectively represent the values of $p$ and $q$ in (de)nominals:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $\\lnot(B \\wedge A)$ $\\lnot C$ $D$ $(A ∧ \\lnot(B ∧ A) ∧ \\lnot C) ∧ D$ $A$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $AF/a$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $TF/t$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $P$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$\n\nNote that the final value of the predicate (truth table) is in italics. Here, as in the above truth table, I’ve mixed (de)nominal and the planning variables. Those in italics are denominated, representing the true-false result of (de)nominal predicates. They could have been popped into (de)nominal slots respective to the nominals. Notice that P=1 represents the fact that A is true, but $(A \\wedge\\lnot(B \\wedge A))$ is false, independent of D. And that A∧B∧C=1 becomes False,Despite that D was true!, and then, since A∧(P/p)=1, we avoid asking if the P/p variable is true! Notice too that the fact that A∧(D/d)=1 is immaterial--the thesis is that the antecedent’s consequence acts only in the presence of the antecedent (dieterily so, that is).\n\n#### Variations\n\nUsually when truth tables are used, a so-called universal quantifier being specified. Instead, why not declare this is the truth table for a universal sentence, and then select dependent variables to put in the corresponding nominals, as shown in the next example\n\nTo cast this result in XML, use the formula below, then cut-and-paste the results in the required template.\nFor example, given this XML template\n\n  <q>If $F$ then $F$</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nenter:\n\n  <q>If FALSE then FALSE</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nas arguments to form the final statement.\n\n#### Complementation and negation\n\nIf we assume that:\n\n• C is true iff A is false;\n• the universal quantifier ((∀x) ...), except when the universal quantifier is not specified, requires A to be a good predicate.\nthen base the meaning on:\n• $A$, the proposition that four legged animals are ruminants;\n• $C$, the proposition that only carnivores are ruminants;\n• so that\n\n $A$ $C$ $A \\vee \\neg C$ $(A\\wedge \\neg C)$ $(Pandemissaelis)$, the grey}] it is apparently simultaneously nothing less than a beef-eater, $\\mathit{a}$ mammal, an herbivore (as in “all mammals are herbivores” ["}

Let`s learn some new calculation rules.\n2,924 \t5 \t427\nIt is not obvious to merge two numbers into another number.\n(2,924 + 5 did not equal to 1002,924 + 427).\n3.401 \t40 <130\nWait and see the pattern related to 427.\n(2,929 ≠ 2,42,528 + 427). \nIf a more complex equation is applied, the\nresult of inserting the negative sign is the same unclear.\n(3,400 + 430 ≠ 3, ,401,40 +430 ). \nThis puzzle rule will is defined properly and applied consistently.\n\n### Question:\nFor this question, please click the >> button.

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n• Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n• Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n• Use the space below to break the rule down into smaller chunks or examples to clarify and separate the puzzle. Enter your part of the puzzle by clearly marking it with a comment beginning with the symbol ## , such as: ## Loop overreach begins here to be complete (expected output for this puzzle is: ## ). Solve the puzzle from left to right such that each row includes one row element.\n• Don't forget to hitch your wagon twice, forward and once to jump through the window.\n• Solve the inclusive equals array puzzle by creating a joint array that contains the elements of start through finish, including any inclusive equals element.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nThe puzzle will have a top, left, and right character column utilized within the equation. Depending on the puzzle, each column will hold an arrow or an inclusive equals. If the column has an arrow, the alternative row containing that arrow will divide the row pairs in half. The equation can be created by lining up the king with his target. The equation is made when the queen places her piece on the board, and the letter in the side arrow is mirrored and moved off of the chessboard.\n\nAfter all moves in the correct order are completed, all promoting of pieces needs to be adapted to the correct alignment for endgame final outcomes. All moves that the rook moves are of special concern throughout figuring out the endgame. Looking at the third variation gives an example for both a side of the least squares equation where the queen is promoted to the side with a rabbe and a side of the least squares equation where the queen promotes to the side with a rook.\n\nWhen trying to puzzle out a sum, the overall leader"}

What is the result, as a matrix? Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4 is read as (1, 2, 3) | 4 What is a column with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as (1 2) (3) (4) Column 1, 2, 3, 4 can be read as (12) (23) (34) One char per column. What is a row with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as 1|(2) 3||4 One char per row. Answer: What is the result as a matrix? Actually, the result is a matrix that contains nothing but the matrices above! That is to say that it is always a single-column matrix like [(1, 2, 3)] (and the size of this matrix is 1×n), even when there are more than 1 row and column. The size of the matrix is therefore 1×m, for some m ≥ k. Further simplification: Let m be the min of 1 times the number of elements in row graphs and 1 times the number of elements in column graphs. In other words, the minimum of number of elements in row graphs and number of elements in column graphs is m (provided that the numbers in row graphs and column graphs are both in non-increasing order; otherwise, we would have to exclude less paths than then number of elements).

Being such competitive individuals, they have improved their own OZ techniques without seeing what the other had come up with.\n\nAlgaman, determined to overwrite zeroes in six bytes, and having never seen Draco’s technique, has created the following:\n\nSigmoïdal.\n\nBy the time Draco had found out, he had himself been busy OZ-ing in nine and three bytes. Despite having seen Algaman’s code, he had an extremely hard time coming up with his own. However, he now has this sketch:\n\nThe Krampus.\n\nGiven this challenge, they are now both trying their best to make the most progressive code using those two methods (of respectively six and three bytes). Each of their means of performing OZ is even further iterated by asking what would be the best it can do after being treated as an optimized null free logic circuit.\n\n# Details\n\n### Binary Circuits\n\nThe two binary circuits are very similar in nature. For the sake of this particular challenge, all binary circuits’ standard inputs and outputs are implied to all be connected. All binary circuits are assumed to always evaluate to true. Therefore, it is allowed to take advantage of mentioned standard inputs and outputs. For the six byte circuit, the inputs are the number and θ(y). With the latter applied first in the order of increasing y, and then the former. For the three byte circuit, the inputs are both the ans and the θ(x).\n\nIn both binary circuits, tails and rectifier gates are always treated so that the Y component of a head/tail is connected to the N as the one only available Y to N, and the N component of a head/tail is connected to the Y as the one only available N to Y. The rectifier gate simply drills across the input wires in the direction of the Y component.\n\n### Integrating Binary Circuits\n\nWe are able to combine both binary circuits together by using a trivial method. For example, we can take Algaman’s six glyph binary circuit and Draco’s three glyph binary circuit and iterate them, and then combine them together. Refer to the Twelve Days of Christmas for an example. In fact, rather than every iteration being identical, we can take advantage of just the first iteration, to optimize the circuit. Look at the Long Christmas Song for consideration. In this particular challenge, we leave all possible logic circuits up to you.\n\n# Input\n\nA positive integer P (P < 1000) representing the number of starts of the Long Christmas Song.\n\n# Output\n\nPrint a binary circuit that optimizes the circuit as a logic circuit. Ignore all special inputs when computing, and assume no special outputs are generated.\n\n## Sample Inputs\n\nSample Input: 3 Sample Output:\n\n# Bugs\n\nIf you find any in your code, you may leave them in. An answer with the most allowed bugs really highlights the fact that you had an optimized circuit!\n\n# Final Call for Endorsing\n\nIf you would like to endorse and submit, you may do so. Simply leave a comment stating that you endorse _rules_, and _rules_, which both have the format “articles-X”, where X is the corresponding number.\n\nThe competition is scheduled to start at 17:00:00 on December 6, 2020, and conclude at 17:00:00 on December 13, 2020. The winners can be seen after submission. Should you decide to sign up, if the code is to surpass  by both putting it to idle and allowing it to pass criticism indefinitely on your own behalf, you should also use the eidolog for the current round, which has yet to be written.\n\nI will gladly handle the payout. Be advised that it will take some time to do the payments and that they will be treated as seriously as the truth. The payout for the same CSD goes at par.\n\nIn order to accept a deal, you may use the tio built-in variable circuitIP (IP: set the output to be 6264 pairs (for full CSD, not merely the first two). This is now a constant variable and cannot be removed). Again, due to the overheads with checking solutions, you are repeatedly allowed the opportunity to update your circuit while we handle the checking for each round of your participation. Having said that, if an account breaks any of the aforementioned guidelines, any payout promised to that account is negated.\n\nMind that excessive use of tools and comparing to existing code (to your knowledge or otherwise) will likely give away your badge for the current CSD.\n\n## Results\n\nAnonymous concedes submission #1.\n\n## Scoring\n\nTouchwood posted 2xY_Mercy where 2xY since  at 14:07:14. However for some reason, the eidologs were not updating. The TIO config bug was fixed. There are puzzles which allow for non-YRD code besides Baseline. Moreover, there are followers of this oath who would awaken if any of the other existing CSDs were assaulted, or put to sleep as YRD. As today’s “CSD has fallen into foundable collapse” (see the explanation of the GCP), we may deem it best to postderve Y_Mercy.\n\nactonb posted 2xY where 2 since 00:25:45 on Lucio Edison’s 4xY, but Merit was received due to the Y_Mercy post which would not change due to the unfair nature of the submission/acceptance."}

Since we are dealing numbers of [X ] around a number, we need to calculate the total number of [X 's] at the exact block. There are 8 kinds of specific [X]s which means we need 8[X] for each block.\n\n2[X][X][X]\n2[X] -> [X][X][X] (Add 2)\nIf this rule is willful enough to ignore numbers, it would be partial information which grasps less problem in perspective. Here it's become negative. It's our unreal brains that recognized a number indicating 8[X]s and added the number in front.\n\nAs mentioned, each condition shows the exact number of [X] blocks for each rule.\n# Rules: 8 numbers -\n1. the Clockwise showing the number of [X] in around this block (X A X X,A 3 3 A X,3 A A X 2,A 3 X 3 A,X X 1 X X)\n2. those 2 numbers in front of a number means the path from top left bottom right to cover all the clues (the Clockwise)\n# Solution as Simple as How to Make an uprcasing:\nTranslating\n1. we would have to read the number above at first, which is \"3\". Then we would read the number of the clockwise, which is A. We need 3 As and one X. So we have an output, XAXA.\n2. we would read next number on the first row -- \"2\". So we would read next next clockwise number -- \"A\"...and we continue reading up to X. Finally we get out result, AAXXX.\n1. A 3 3 -> 3A\nA A 3 X -> 3A\nA A A X 2 -> 3A\nA 3 A X 2 -> 3A\nX X 1 X X -> A\nSince we read the result we can go back the clues and figure it out. And that's the general solution which we can apply to the all questions.\n\n\n### Before anyone can solve mine the nights:\n\n- First of all, rule is very simple.\n- But we should notice the tricky situation.\n- The output too \"shaken\". So the line of output is forgotten.\n\nPlease do not give up when you find missing information.\nThink like a radiologist..\nLook for the key signal for the puzzle. Only key signal is valuable.\n\n\n\nclass SolutionByJiyao {\n// method01: \"naive\" method, which consider the mine variation\n// method02: help by taking into consideration the surrounding numbers\nprivate:\nSolutionByJiyao() = default;\nvirtual ~SolutionByJiyao() = default;\nint StupidSolution( const std::string &input ) {\nint retNums = -1 ;\n// Your code here!\nfor( const auto ss: input ) {\nfloat nums = 0.0 ;\nss >> nums ;\nif( nums < 0.0 ) {\nreturn (int) retNums ;\n}\nretNums = static_cast< int >( nums ) ;\n}\nfor( const auto ss: input ) {\nstd::vector strs ;\nstd::string str ;\nss >> str ;\nstrs = split( str, ',' ) ;\nretNums *= splitDeleteRepeats( strs ) ;\n}\n\nreturn (int) retNums ;\n}\nint smartSolution( const std::string &input ) {\nint retNums ;\nfor( const auto &line : input.split( '\\n' ) ) {\nstd::string str ;\nss >> str ;\nbool printable = isDigitalCharacter( str ) ;\nif( str.length() < 2 ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nif( !printable ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nchar firstVal ;\nss >> firstVal ;\nconst double startVal = firstVal ;\nstd::string secondVal ;\nss >> secondVal ;\nconst double secondValFloat = static_cast< double >( atoi( secondVal.c_str() ) ) ;\nif( isNegative( secondValFloat ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nstd::vector sexes ;\nmakeVertexArray( sex, ',' ) ;\nconst bool host = boolMakeSexesFromException( startVal, !host ) ;\nmakeVertexGiveTheListOfNukes( host, males ) ;\nforceMakeVertexArrays( sex, host, sexElems, females ) ;\nint finalDirection ;\nss >> finalDirection ;\nif( !sex( sexElems[ finalDirection ] ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nint val ;\nss >> val ;\nif( !numProperties( val ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nconst long long forcedSingleVal = val ;\nconst double correctedVal = 1.0 ;\nforcedSingleVal += correctedVal ;\nconst string bodySex = sex( sexElems[ finalDirection ] ) ? \"F\" : \"M\" ;\nconst double steps = ( refValue( startVal ) - oneFirst[ finalDirection ] );\nfor( auto &&it : childientes ) {\nif( isParent( it, children , val ) && sexElems.find( it ) == sexElems.end() ) {\nretNums |= it;\n}\n}\nsss >> sexElems;\nif( sss.rdstate() == std::ios_base::failbit ) {\nbreak;\n}\nfor( const auto &ndVal : numDigits ) {\nif( !numProperties( ndVal ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nconst bool finalAgain = true ;\nif( sexElems.find( \"no\");\n}\n}\nprintable = isDigitalCharacter( str ) ;\nif( ( int ) ( retNums ) == 0 ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\n// should be first !!! you have to redesign smart and smartProof to have it the first\nif( !printable ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\nss >> retNums ;\n}\nif( retNums == 0 ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\nreturn ( int ) retNums ;\n}\nstd::string append( const std::string &val, const char c ) {\nstd::string retNums ;\nint nSize = static_cast< int >( val.length() + 1 ) ;\nretNums.resize( nSize, c ) ;\nretNums.push_back( '0' ) ;\nUnicodeFormatter strf( retNums,\nUF_BIG_ENDIAN |\nUF_LEGAL_BUFFER |\nUF_PREKEYS |\nUF_V32_SIZE_3 |\nUF_V64_SIZE_1 );\nsprintfString( strf, \"nNum\" ) ;\nreturn static_cast< std::string >( retNums ) ;\n}\n: input ) {\nconst auto size = static_cast< int >( numMines );\nmines = std::vector( size, 0 ) ;\nnumMines = size ;\nfor( auto &x : macroMineValues ) {\nauto pos = static_cast< int >( numpy - minNum );\njs += str + \",V\" + stringify( pos ) ;\n}\nmapfinedrawMineFields( asms, mines );\nasm->generateBcpAndRngTroops( true );\nauto fn = makeFmmlNotTheSection( 1 ) ;\nn++;\nauto asym = makeTroopsAccordingToMineValues( mines, false );\nactionPlacementsWithOneStrutBomb(\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ,\n\t\t\t\tstd::placeholders::_1,\n\t\t\t\tstd::placeholders::_2 ) ) ) ) ;\n{\nauto func = [&]( const std::string &val ) {\nreturn uniqueBoxing( sectionTrueAmplse, val ) ;\n} ;\nbool &aCutSum ;\ndecimalParseToDouble( doubleAdd,\ndoubleSit,\ns,\n&a ) ;\n}}\nuse( func ) ;\n\"\"\";\n\n\t\t// Brand New Title Given :\n \t\t\t\t // z z z z z z z\n// --Yours Truly: Jiyao\n-- z"}

Had to go back and fix that, after deciding not to apply the third rule.\n\nSWOBODA trying to resolve by using rules 3,4,5, etc.\nSWOBODA circles in the SE corner matching but not 2 of the others.\nSWOBODA seeing circles in the anticlockwise SE corner matching, decided not to apply rule 3 several down.\nSWOBODA adding a certain number of letters in a , then in c, the rest 0.\nSWOBODA deciding that rules 3, as applied here, could not help because the letters had not to be in the same order. Had not applied the first rule to empty letters.\nSWOBODA thinking about how one of the squares could be one of 3 different rectangles, but without either option in the SWUE, couldn't decide where, which was correct. That is a group of rules we applied later, in the continuation of this puzzle.\nSWOBODA thinking of \"way\", so tried that with what appeared at first to be a SW grid 1,2,3 on the right. Turns out that grid 1,2,3 has a 0 instead of a 2, but the letters and positioning are the same.\nSWOBODA had \"way\" in the ant triangle, and circled that, but AWAY the letters that did not match SW.\nSWOBODA thinking for too long that a rectangular puzzle might want one of 3 answers, none of which fitted at all here.\nSWOBODA considering a rectangle which matched one orientation on the left, but the blocks were supposed to form a rectangle above it.\nSWOBODA seeing the larger BLOCK(S) in the bottom right, got as far as assuming that perhaps a B might be part of a word above it. Realized that B's word is \"bore\" while the bottom right was \"bolas\".\nSWOBODA not keeping notes, as usual. The \"loser\" to the previous puzzle got me back on track, after I got a good rules note from an outside source, right after SWOBODA the next puzzle. (Your rules note had information on latin square, #s 2-4, we used later, in a puzzle we made, which Danny critiqued on Round 1.)\nSWOBODA beginning to recollect that looking for patterns and bypassing some rules could help.\nSWOBODA first rule was to fill words where there are 0. Words that aren't filled or need to be 0 are put in the square at 4. This corresponds to See, any, chess player, 5. Danny got the first points with this answer.\nSWOBODA Pink MIDDLE, \"bolo de LONA\" which made sense in that the letters were rhyming.\nSWOBODA thinking about \"blook\" and \"block\". This answer had \"eye\" and \"knee for b&c. Since one grid didn't have blocks, we decided that was the answer. SWOBODA's next puzzle I believe. (Especially after confirming with Danny.)\n\nSWOBODA rules 1,4,5, went to the topured triangle of the LON, searching for r, t,$0,6... SWOBODA, this was soon confirmed that we tried on the puzzle SWOBODA created later. We reckoned it was skip, super, the manager of... and stayed with that path, extended to WED, one of many common 3 letter words In the same tile. SWOBODA found a B in the bottom right spot which made us conjecture that the puzzle SWOBODA created later with 2 B's. SWOBODA erroneously guessed that it was skip that was repeated, when it was spot. SWOBODA forgot the i,t doubles. SWOBODA deconstructed several the rectangle puzzle, only to discover it had been suggesting two 3's instead of 1.. SWOBODA playing with the middle of SO-ME (correct) to -HOSE (Not a real word)? Perhaps it had been both will … SWOBODA using latin squares to fill in negative-based words that correspond to repeated letters. The first r had assumed it was skip. SWOBODA thought the columns lined up after looking at inverted bagel. Then discovered it started with expired.
