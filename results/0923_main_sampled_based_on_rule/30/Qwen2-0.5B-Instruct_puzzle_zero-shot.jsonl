However, in the provided rule, the length of each word is not specified. \n\nGiven the rule, the 3 state * 3 state word is required. This means that for the first 3 letters, we can choose 3 of the 5 given letters (and possibly some possible rearrangements of letters, but since we are dealing with the 3 state and we have 3 letters), while for the 3 state, we need to choose 3 of the 5 letters. To align with the rule provided clearly and explicitly, we would solve for 3 state words first, and then arrange them as a 3 state * 2 state word. Here's the solution within the constraints:\n\n- 3 state * 3 state word: [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]]\n\nSo, the answer is [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]].

This is because addition, multiplication, and division are typically done from left to right, and subtraction and division are performed in the opposite direction. Therefore, we subtract 4 from 14 to get 10, which is the correct answer."}

Begin by providing the initial height of each skyscraper within the grid.\n2. Logic must ensure not two skyscrapers of the same height appear in the same row or column. Apply this constraint carefully to recreate the desired layout.\n3. Each row and column must encapsulate Xs indicating skyscrapers, represented as dots, separated by commas. \n\n### Nutritional Supplement:\nList the numerical constraints attached to the top and bottom of the matrix and ensure they're easily digested by participants.\n\n### Final Step:\nBear in mind that the total heights of the skyscrapers in the matrix should be presented from left to right, top to bottom. Pay close attention to alignment and formatting.\n\n### Sample Output:\n\\[\n\\left[\\boxed{1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0}, \\boxed{0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, \\boxed{0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}, \\boxed{0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}\\right]\n\\]\n```"}
