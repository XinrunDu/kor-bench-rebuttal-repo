Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The game starts with a word and specifies an ending word.\n2.Only one letter can be changed at a time, and each intermediate step must be a valid word.\n3.Change from the start word to the end word by the fewest steps.\n4.The question will give the start and end words, answer the minimum number of steps needed to change from the start word to the end word.\n\n### Question:\nFrom \"LOST\" to \"HERE\".\nOutput the number in double brackets. For example, if it takes 3 steps from the start word to the end word, present the answer as [[3]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To implement this puzzle rule:\n\n1. Identify the start word as \"LOST\".\n2. Identify the end word as \"HERE\".\n3. To find the minimum number of steps, consider the provided instructions carefully:\n\n   - Rule states that only one letter can change at a time.\n   - Each step must be a valid word.\n   - The first step needs to cover the initial \"O\" in \"LOST\".\n   - Next, \"T\" in \"LOST\" needs to be changed to an \"E\".\n   - Changing \"T\" to \"E\" is the shortest step to add to \"LOST\" to become \"ONT\".\n   - The next change is \"E\" in \"ONT\" to \"HER\".\n   - Finally, \"R\" in \"HER\" needs to be changed to \"E\".\n\nTherefore, changingstep from the start word to the end word is as follows:\n[2][2][2][2]\nThis represents the output [[2], [2], [2], [2]] steps that need to be taken. So, we report the final answer without the brackets:\n2222."}

Each partition consists of a number of squares.\n2.Place stars in the given grid.\n3.n stars are placed in each row and column.\n4.n stars are placed in each partition.\n5.Stars cannot be adjacent, i.e., there can be no stars in adjacent squares (including diagonally adjacent).\n6.The question is given in the form of a matrix with different regions labeled with different letters, e.g. the grid where all the letters A are located forms a region and the answer should list the coordinates of the stars in each region, e.g. A:(row i, column j)\n\n### Question:\nA\tA\tA\tB\tB\tC\tC\tC\tC\tD\nA\tA\tB\tB\tB\tC\tC\tC\tC\tD\nA\tA\tA\tA\tB\tC\tD\tD\tD\tD\nA\tA\tA\tA\tB\tC\tD\tD\tD\tD\nA\tA\tA\tF\tB\tF\tG\tD\tD\tD\nE\tA\tF\tF\tF\tF\tG\tG\tG\tD\nE\tE\tE\tF\tF\tF\tF\tI\tG\tD\nH\tE\tH\tH\tF\tF\tI\tI\tG\tG\nH\tH\tH\tH\tH\tI\tI\tJ\tJ\tG\nH\tH\tH\tH\tH\tJ\tJ\tJ\tJ\tJ\n\nOutput in alphabetical order, if there are more than one stellar coordinates in a region, write the coordinates of the answer with the smallest number of rows first, if the number of rows is the same, then write the one with the smallest number of columns first, and the coordinates of the different regions are separated by a line breaker.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this:\n[[A(1,1)(2,5)\nB(1,3)(3,2)\nC(3,7)(4,9)]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A(1,1)(2,5)]]"}
