Since we have two instances of '※' in the equation, we need to simplify it step by step. We start from left to right or right to left. Let's try both methods and see which one leads to a feasible solution.\n\n**Method 1: Operate from Left to Right (25※X first, then result※14)**\n\nLet's assume we first calculate the left part, 25※X.\n\n### Option 1A: 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X = 25/X + 2\nBut since X divides 25 (X | 25), X can be 1, 5, or 25 because these are the divisors of 25.\n\n1. If X = 1: 25※1 = 25/1 + 2 = 27.\n2. If X = 5: 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 7.\n3. If X = 25: 25※25 = 25/25 + 2 = 3.\n\nThen, we take the result (27, 7, or 3) ＊ 14 and try to make it equal to 4. None of these options lead to 4 when operated on with 14, given the operation rules.\n\n### Option 1B: 14 is a multiple of the result of the first operation, which seems indirect and depends on the first operation's result, leading to a complex calculation and ultimately not leading us to a feasible X.\n\n### Option 1C: None of 25 and X are multiples of each other, then 25※X = 24.\nTherefore, we have 24※14=4.\n\nGiven the operation rules:\n- We check if 24 is a multiple of 14; it isn't, nor is 14 a multiple of 24.\n- Therefore, the operation result would be 24 again, which contradicts the given result of 4, and this does not give us a specific value for X.\n\n**Method 2: Operate from Right to Left (14※X first, then 25※result)**\n\n### Option 2A: Assume X is a multiple of 14, X※14 = X/14 + 2.\nLet's assume for a moment 14※X is a value that when operated with 25 provides the result 4. But further analyzing, this does not lead us to a specific value of X or contradicts the rules since it means that X/14 + 2 operated with 25 would result in 4.\n\n### Option 2B: Assume 14※X = 24, which does not depend on X's value and directly contradicts the goal of the problem statement as 25 operated on any value that gives us 24 would not satisfy the given final solution of 4.\n\n### Option 2C: 14※X leads to an unspecified value that when operated by '※' with 25 is 4, but without a direct path from 14※X to 4.\n\nA direct evaluation through standard algebraic methods or directly applying operation rules from the equation seems unfeasible without making assumptions that do not align with provided operation definitions.\n\nBetween the methods and options analyzed, Option 1C creates a misleading dead-end. In reality, following strict operation rules directly from the given equation, under the assumption we apply operations from left to right as well right to left, reveals the need for specific conditions to satisfy 25※X※14=4, but these conditions do not emerge clearly from predefined rules or standard algebraic manipulations.\n\nDue to the complexity and non-direct application of operation rules under given conditions, further investigation reveals the challenge in methodologically pinpointing X's value using specified rules and the constraints of the question.\n\nGiven the analysis and attempts at solving through different approaches while strictly following operation rules indicates an unusual adherence to solving the equation directly from provided rules indicates an unusual or challenging scenario that may not have a straightforward solution under traditional algebraic operations, leading us to reflect on the evaluative constraints when interpreted under specific operational rules defined.\n\nSince there is no specific method defined to solve such a scenario using pure algebraic rules while strictly adhering to given custom operation definitions, [[this indicates there might be a limitation or an unusual edge scenario under operation rules defined, leading to no known direct solving method]].\n\nHowever, directly answering, as per your format request, we find this to present [[an unconventional scenario as per standard problem-solving methods]]."}
