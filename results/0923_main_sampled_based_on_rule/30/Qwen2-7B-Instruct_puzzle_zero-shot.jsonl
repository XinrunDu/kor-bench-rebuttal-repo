Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to place black cells in a way that matches the given conditions. Let's apply the rules step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the bottom-right corner where the grid cells directly form a 6x7 matrix.\n2. The numbers are attached to the grid's columns and rows to guide black cell placements.\n3. The rule states the weight in a row or column depends on its position, so the cells with weight 1, 2, ..., n must be set in that cell's row or column position.\n\nBasing on the given numbers, let's fill the matrix with the strategy to place weights covering rows and columns up to the mentioned requirements:\n\n```\n    Col 1 2 3 4 5*6 7 (sum=10)\n    Row *\n    1   1   2   3  4   5  6  16 // High sum -> Eastern cells blocked\n    2   1   2   3   4  5  X  12 // 12 sum requires cells 1-4 and cell 7\n    3   1   2   3   4   5*X  6  16 // 16 sum requires cells 1-4 and cell 6\n    4   1   2   3   X   4   5  15 // 15 sum requires cell 1 or 5 and cells 2-4\n    5   1   2   X   3   4   5  18 // 18 sum requires cells 1, 3, and 5-7\n    6   1   2   X   3   4 *5   10 // 10 sum requires cells 1-3 and cell 5\n    7   1*   2   3   4   5   6   // missing row sum 19 is already satisfied in previous steps\n```\n\nLooking closely, the solver should realize that the third row already manages to reach its sum with no need for further blackening. Now, for the column sums:\n\n```\n    Col 1 2 3 4 5 (sum=next lower max value fit)\n    Row *\n    1   *   *   *   *   *\n    2   *   *   *   *\n    3   *   * *     *\n    4   * *   *   *   *\n    5   *   *   * *   X\n    6   *   *   * *     * // The matrix's corner has been locked by previous black cell placements\n    *   *   * * *      *    // Cell at row 7, col 6 is the only remaining placement to reach Row sum 19\n```\n\nThe completed placements and summary are as follows:\n\nCells to be set to '1' by the solver: [1 2 3 5 7 1 2 4 3 5 4 1 3 5 2 6 1**\n\nFinal answer, wrapped in double square brackets:\n[[1 2 3 5 7 1 2 4 3 5 4 1 3 5 2 6 1]]"}

An inflection point, in this context, is where the movement reverses either horizontally or vertically.\n\nThe maze is represented as:\n```\n0 1 2\n0 1 2\n0 1 2\n```\nwith the grid coordinates starting from `(0,0)` in the top-left corner, and directions given as provided.\n\nLet's analyze each row to identify the inflection points:\n\n1. Starting in row 1 (directions: →, →, ↓, ←)\n   - No inflection point in the first two columns since the player moves straight until the end of this row.\n   - At the dot (placement of arrows), an inflection point occurs due to the instruction (↙), which means the player changes direction immediately, moving diagonally downward to the left.\n   - Thus, the inflection point in row 1 is at (2, 3) or row 2, column 3.\n\n2. Starting in row 2 (directions: ↓, ←, →, ↙)\n   - An inflection point occurs at the first column where the arrow changes: (0, 1) or row 1, column 1.\n\n3. Starting in row 3 (directions: →, ↑, ↓, ↓)\n   - At the second column, there is an inflection point due to the change from moving down to up: (1, 2) or row 2, column 3.\n\nTo format the answer, we convert the positions to a specific format as requested:\n```markdown\n[[1 0,2 0,2 1]]\n```\n\nThis represents the following:\n- Inflection point at row 1, column 0,\n- Inflection point at row 2, column 0,\n- Inflection point at row 2, column 1.\n\nThe output, wrapped in double square brackets, is:\n```markdown\n[[1 0, 2 0, 2 1]]\n```"}

A dynamically generated solution approach, as shown, iterates through the puzzle grid, applying constraints to determine the correct height for each cell step-by-step, ensuring no skyscrapers of the same height share a row or column and matching the count of visible skyscrapers as specified by the given borders."}
