To solve this, we will use the given formula and the constraints. Here is a step-by-step approach to find the values of A, B, C, and D:\n\n1. **Identify Variables**: There are four variables (A, B, C, D). We need to find their values (0-9) based on the product `[EE]` and the numbers given to _each digit_ of `EE`.\n\n2. **Simplify the Product [EE]:** Notice that `EE` can be reduced to `[]` because the formula only gives letters and involves no numerical values.\n\n3. We can start with guesses based on the constraints.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n- From the first equation:\n  ```\n  (EE) + (THAT) = APPLE\n  ```\n\n- Let's start by guessing some values for A. Since the first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0, we will try single-letter values for A and see how it fits logically.\n\n    - A = 1:\n        - Trying A = 1, we get:\n          ```\n          1EE + 2THAT = apple\n          ```  \n        - This gives:\n          ```\n          one + two = altar\n          ```\n\n- Now, let's try to fill in the rest.\n\n    - B and C need to fit according to the constraints without repetition:\n      ```\n      if A is 1, what can B and C be?\n      let's try B = 4 and C = 6 or B = 4 and C = 6:\n      (EE)(28) = (apple)\n      ```\n      \n    - Checking for A=1 and C=3, we get:\n      ```\n      [[EE], 32]\n      ```\n\nIf there's a mistake in me, please let me know and I'll adjust my approach.\n\nWith multiple possibilities tested to find a unique solution, and the context of a specific formula (EAT+THAT=APPLE), I've provided an answer based very intuitively where each letter could theoretically add up to a unique number via IIFE calls and values based on constraints. Thus, the value of A = 1, B = 4, C = 6, D = 2, without further constraint conflict, this would now allow 'EE' to hold a different value needed to coincide perfectly with 'THAT' systematically ensuring the constraints."}

We find 'BASTION' has 2 letters and reveals 'A'.\n     - Then, go with 'G', intersecting to get 'GAV').\n     - Proceed to 'FriL', intersecting to 'H' (from 'UR' in 'OBAEE').\n     - Continue in ('LT', next for 'X' and 'A').\n   - This vector must now lead across the grid towards 'B'.\n   - Following 'NEXTE', check for 'PILLBOX' which also starts with 'P' in column 12, running through row 12.\n\n4. **Detailed Coordinates:**\n   - Starting from ('TUSH', 'EEN'):\n     - Use 'FOR' to find the hidden word 'FORCER'.\n   - Proceed to ('TOVAD', 'SEN').\n   - Moving down to ('ST', 'FEN').\n   - Checking in ('UN', 'RE').\n   - Continue up to ('TP', 'B',_WHITE).\n\n5. **Verification and Correct Formatting:**\n   - Each word found intersects at a unique position in the grid, ensuring accuracy of positions' order.\n\n6. **Output Format:**\n   - Display the coordinates of the word 'FORCER IN columns 12, 13' AND IN ROW 12, resulting in (12,13)(12,12).\n   - Weekender word 'UNIEN' is flagged for the nextwords due to 'FOR', followed by [('TINT', 'LUN', 'JVIOUS')]:\n\n   ```\n   [TINT(BACH(12,4)(12,13)\n  (LUN(CITADEL(12,7)(12,12) \n  YOUTH(IN 13,2\"),\n\n```\n\nThis completes the analysis and rules application for the puzzle."}

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, I need to first understand the given rule, break it down, and then apply it accurately.\n\n### Breaking Down the Rule:\n1. **Matrix Construction**: The puzzle consists of a 5x5 matrix filled with numbers, where each number at the end of each row or column represents the sum of the number at that position.\n2. **Rows Sum**: Check the numbers in each row and column to find the sums for each row/column.\n3. **Puzzle Section**: Identify the final section of the puzzle which is represented by 'The final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom' and should be filled with three numbers (X, X, X).\n\n### Applying the Rule Cleanly:\n\n1. **First Row Sum Identification**: The sum of the first row is 26.\n2. **Choose a Set of Numbers**: The sum here is 26, so one possible set of numbers that could fill the remaining spaces to get the sum '26' in the row is '23' (since 26 - 23 = 3), '14' (since 26 - 23 - 14 = 0), and '19' (since 26 - 23 - 14 - 19 = -1, but as per the rule, we need to break down smaller error).\n\n3. **Square Matrix Formation**: Recognize the structure.\n4. **Filling Numbers**: Fill in the rows one by one and perform a similar process for the columns.\n\n### Final Matrix Filling:\nBreaking down the first row using 'X' and Filling each subsequent row with a minimal set of numbers that sum up correctly according to the rule:\n```\n[23, 14, 19, 3, 5]\n[19, 3, 14, 3, 2]\n[15, 14, 10, 7, 3]\n[29, 23, 12, 14, 8]\n[15, 23, 29, 24, 13]\n```\nNow I'm filling in the columns considering the logical conditions.\n5. **Final Answer**: Arrange the numbers in the required order without any disjointed lines.\n\nThus, the final matrix will be:\n```\n[23, 14, 19, 3, 5]\n[19, 3, 14, 3, 2]\n[15, 14, 10, 7, 3]\n[29, 23, 12, 14, 8]\n[15, 23, 29, 24, 13]\n```\nJoined entire matrix and sorted:\n```\n[23, 14, 19, 3, 5, 19, 3, 14, 15, 3, 10, 7, 3, 15, 23, 29, 24, 3, 2, 14, 12, 14, 8, 15, 29, 23, 23, 10, 15, 23, 23, 24, 13, 14, 12, 10, 19]\n```\nIn Python code:\n```python\n[[23, 14, 19, 3, 5, 23, 23, 14, 15, 3, 19, 3, 10, 3, 15, 29, 14, 12, 14, 29, 15, 19, 19, 23, 23, 10, 8, 23, 23, 10, 15, 24, 24, 3, 24, 13, 19, 24, 23, 23, 23, 23]]\n```"}

Let's break down the rule and apply it step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The grid is an n×n grid filled with numbered and blank squares, with arrows connecting numbered squares to empty areas minus the black square.\n\n2. **Define Each Number and Blank Area**: We are given a matrix with X as blank squares, and we need to use the arrows to effectively fill in the rows, columns, and diagonals of the grid.\n\n3. **Total Considerations**: The centerpiece of solving this puzzle is that the number of squares covered by arrows must equal the number on the black square. This provides consistent constraints within your arrows.\n\n4. **Arrows and Arrows Purpose**: An arrow can extend along coordinates (after siblings use options ↓ ↑ → ←).

Further Voting processes creates positive or negative visual categorizations.\n\n6. **Directly Working Process**:\n  - To slightly break away by listing the operation voltages, where each inner, regressed square leaves each column, per the new requirements prerequisite serve as posteriors, substantiate against a higher array.\n  - Consider the multimodal truth zero another consideration.\n\n7. **Optimal Crossing Through Twitch Networks**:\n  - Draws.\n  - Place the correct values of arrow where more n. evaluator benefits an outcome of 4, appropriately spanning non-cross-adjusted conditions, it's a simple whiteboards.\n\n8. **Analyze Necessities to Complete Quadrant Form**:\n  - Step by row, column then diagonal filtering.\n  - Finally concatenate column vertex sequences processing one.\n\n### Applying Rule:\n\n1. **X Under Black Square**: Quickly, check the overview recording 1,1 indicated in the provided grid is verified N.\n2. **Subsequent Diagram Indication Processing**:\n   - Cumulus N, X dimensions check.\n   - Notice 8 X forbidden count indicates steps morning outer.\n3. **Invert Across New Jumps**:\n   - Check for intermediary logical conflicts first.\n4. **Initializing Example of Registration** \n   - Ensure x practical step computation elaborates every interim column, optionally.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, The best figure is:\n[[[X ↓ ↑ <, X 1 ↓ <, X 1  X ↓ <, < ↓ ↑ <, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ >, ↓ > < → ^ -> ^<]]]\n\nNote: The format would benefit from the balance between multiple elements with comma and square brackets denoting them. \nThe final answer wrapped in square brackets and separated is:\n[[[X ↓ ↑ <, X 1 ↓ <, X 1  X ↓ <, < ↓ ↑ <, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ >, ↓ > < → ^ -> ^<]]]"}

Therefore, the left side of the puzzle equation is:\n  - [X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - After identifying the zeros (X's), we get:\n    - [ X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - The total number of mines in row 1 is: 2.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of remaining squares to be filled by diamonds\n- The remaining numbers in row 1 are 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. This brings the total number of squares to be:\n  - [X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - Calculating the number of diamonds would require examining the remaining numbers left.\n  - The excluded number 2 contributes 1 square, making the total 3 squares left.\n  - Therefore, the remaining squares are 9 (since down row 1 has 4 mines - which must be partially filled to fit in a diamond, it actually contributes minus the condition 2 x 2 are filled x 2 mean the total based on unique number of mines gives 3 remaining).\n\n### Step 4: Apply the rule for diamonds by replacing X with A\n- Replace the squares (A's with X's): Substituting mine X with additional complement A's from the erased square groups. \n\nGiven the remaining squares to be 9, replace the X's in the first column groups, grouped gaps (1, repeat of X's and 2's) back with A's.\n\n### Final Step-by-Sort: Apply these steps to fill the rest of the grid.\n\nFrom a grid-wise exploration, applicable fields in the next step:\n\n1. Determine squares 2, Delta - floor(n + 1) / 2; (2- extra)\n\n2. Determine size effectively, by third row.
