Ensure that your output is formatted according to the specified equivalence between ciphertext and plaintext. ## Step 1: Analyze the rules provided for encryption and decryption.\nTo follow these rules, we need to understand the transformation applied to the plaintext to produce the ciphertext through a specific scheme (encrypted scheme or decryption scheme). The rule suggests a systematic approach that involves taking a plaintext string and applying a series of operations (ciphertext_to_input and input_to_decryption) before finding the original plaintext string.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the encrypted solution based on the provided rule.\nThe rule states that the output is the input string with an encrypted purpose, implying there is a conversion between the plaintext and its encrypted form.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the encryption and decryption processes exactly as described in the rules.\nUsing the \"affine alphabet\" A = 3, B = 5, A_inv = 9, and constructing the Cartesian x-y pairing according to the affine conversion process, we start by finding the x-coordinate of the given plaintext character \"Z\" using the identity element A_inv, and then calculate the corresponding ciphertext character.\n\n## Step 4: Translate the plaintext character \"Z\" into the equivalent character (post-ciphertext).\nFollowing the pairings for the affine conversion, \"Z\" becomes A_inv * (9 - B) % m_number.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the encryption step and format the output within the provided notation.\n- Input (plaintext character): \"Z\"\n- Ciphertext (encrypted character) equals (A_inv * (9 - 5)) % 366\n- The output format should include the converted character in brackets.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[A_{\\text{post-ciphertext"}

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"H\"\nperiod: 14\nincrement: 3\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

They do not have constraints on the uppercase alphabet or digits. PLAINFORMAT\n\nThe first step is to read the plaintext into a string and remove any unnecessary spaces or punctuation characters. This gives you the plaintext \"FO\".\n\nNext, we'll use the surrounding Girds to split the plaintext into groups of 6 characters each. This ensures that every group has the same number of characters, which is crucial for the encryption process.\n\nThen, we'll split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. Each binary group represents two digits (T and H). We'll use these binary groups to determine the corresponding row and column numbers in the Girds table.\n\nOnce we have the row and column numbers for each binary group, we'll find the corresponding letter using the corresponding binary group from the Gird3 table. We'll then base the decrypted message on this corresponding letter.\n\nFinally, we'll group the decrypted messages together, remove the # characters at the end, and return the final result."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nNone\n\nI apologize for any confusion. Here's the solution:\n\nPlaintext: \"TDECY\"\n\nGenerate the syntactically correct encrypted string.\n\nAlgorithms must be included. To construct an encrypted string based on the provided instructions, we need to understand the process and then convert it into a code snippet. Unfortunately, the rules and actions are not provided in the instruction manual. However, based on common encryption logic, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. For plaintext input (TDECY), follow these steps:\n   - Input: TDECY\n   - Encryption Steps:\n     - Downward Fill with '#': The first line will be filled with a '#', the second line with a '#', and so on.\n     - Turn to upward padding: Fill another line upwards based on upward direction from previous lines.\n     - Downward padding to continue filling: When finishing each line, turn to upward padding.\n   - The final product is:\n\n```\nH L ##\nE R D\nL O ##\nL W ##\nO ##\n```\n\nThis string will remain unchanged after the process of filling lines. However, in actual decryption, we would need to reverse the process to get back the original input.\n\nTo generate an encrypted string, we can use a flexible approach where we follow the encryption steps described, but apply them reversibly to obtain an encrypted string. Here's how we get it:\n\n2. Now, we encrypt the input string, forming an encrypted message that will also remain unchanged after applying the encryption steps:\n\n```\nH L ##\nE R D\nL O ##\nL W ##\nO ##\n```\n\nIn this process, our solution is essentially the repetition of the iterative process applied to our original input. It should be able to decrypt the encrypted string correctly, but the entire system does not follow normal English.\n\nOverall, the encryption process described is a reflexive process, and reversing it in the answer structure would not strictly follow the rules given. Hence, the output would be the encryption string described above, along with any and all infferences given and unknowns clarified but not yet revealed. \n\nThe combination of steps as the initial setup, nothing -> simply interpretation of the string as a system, on the answer becomes the repeated message of applied encrypted strings, thus generating a checksum.\n\nIn summary: The approach to encrypt the plaintext is to repeatedly iterate the process outlined in steps to a set of required lines, which can then be reversed to decrypt the data. The enemy blatantly non-verbalized in-manassquq an interpreter, which has to guess and run tests."}

When encrypting and decrypting, I have to break the code using the code above, there is basically two encryption steps:\r\n\r\n1) fornumber: for each letter passed to the stream on the plaintext half, it should match a number in the ciphertext half.\r\n\r\n2) Copy to: for each letter, incrementing the password by one must be used.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do since most of the properties are blank in the rule for this cipher. To assist in understanding and implementing the encryption and decryption of the cipher, let's break it down step-by-step based on the given instructions and the provided \"plain text\" variable.\n\n**Plain Text Input:**\n- \"MMRWZX\"\n\n**Encryption (Using 44 base point)**\n\n1. **Encryption Rules:**\n   - 1. The alphabet consists of uppercase letters only (A-Z).\n   - 2. Punctuation marks (.,!) remain unchanged.\n   - 3. Each chunk of plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") is run on the plain text (e.g., encrypt the word \"MMWX\").\n   - 4. The plain text used to encrypt communication is eight characters long.\n   - 5. The input plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") consists of a section of unique characters (starting and ending with 'M') followed by eight punctuation marks.\n   - 6. The ciphertext will be similar to the plaintext, but with certain changes.\n\n2. **Encryption Steps:**\n   - **Line Writing**: The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with the maximum of five characters per line (e.g., MMWJRRX^Z).\n     - **Example**: For \"MMRWZX\", write the first line, MMW, from left to right (added UP), write MMW, from right to left (added DOWN). Read both lines to get:\n       - First line: MMW\n       - Second line: WX^Z\n   - **Reading**: Read by column, each column captured once (from the top and down), with an increment of punctuation (added as part of base).

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
