Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are equivalent, we need to translate the implications into their respective negation-or forms based on the given rule (A > B ::=:: !A | B), and then simplify and compare the forms using the provided equivalences.\n\nFirst, let's translate `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `(p>q)>r` can be translated to `!(p>q)|r` by rule (10).\n2. `!(p>q)` can be further translated to `!!p | !q` by rule (10) again.\n3. Thus, `(p>q)>r` becomes `(!!p | !q)|r`.\n\nBy the idempotence law (2-3), `!!p` can be simplified to `p`.\n\nSo, we have `(p | !q) | r` as our first expression.\n\nNext, for `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` translates directly using rule (10) to `!p | (q>r)`.\n2. Using rule (10) for the nested implication `(q>r)`, it becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nComparing the fully simplified forms:\n- `(p>q)>r` becomes `(p | !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo check equivalence, compare `(p | !q) | r` and `!p | (!q | r)` using the given equivalences.\n\n`(p | !q) | r` is not directly equivalent to `!p | (!q | r)` based on the provided equivalences without further steps, but we can see that neither expression directly simplifies or restructures into the other without additional transformations that aren't specified or straightforward under the given rules.\n\nGiven that through direct transformation, none of the provided equivalences directly confirm they are identical forms, and looking closely the structure of the expressions seems to hint towards different outcomes in certain scenarios (as `p` is negated in one and not the other), the conclusion leans towards them not being equivalent under all truth value scenarios.\n\n[[B]]"}

Hence, as a simple answer format, (1) does not hold with direct equivalence as all terms cannot be transformed directly to match the structure of one another under the given logical operators.\n\n4.

(!p | !q | r)` for the first and `!( !p | !q | !r )` for the second under derivation, they indeed hold the same logical equivalence under the rules provided, considering De Morgan's laws and the definition of NOR operator.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

Each disjunction contains propositions and their negations. In fact, if we rewrite the formula, we see that it\u2019s already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses (disjunctions).\n\nGiven the definition provided, however, we have to confirm whether the given formula can be part of a PCNF or PDNF. A principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) is a disjunction of all paired conjunctive terms, while a principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) consists of all paired disjunctive terms.\n\nUpon examination, the given formula is:\n\\[\n(p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly in conjunctive normal form (CNF) because it is a conjunction of disjunctions. The question now is to determine if it can be represented as a PCNF.\n\n**Step 3: Check if this formula fits the PCNF criteria.**\n\nThe formula given \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) needs to be examined against the specifications of PCNF.

But the next question is to check if this represents every possible paired conjunctive term (the correct term would be disjunctive in this case based on the structure of PCNF).\n\nThis particular formula seems to cover a set of clauses that do not constitute all possible disjunctive terms required to represent a complete PCNF for three variables (p, q, r) which would require all possible combinations and closures (or openings) of these variables to cover all cases.\n\nSince \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) does not form all possible clauses for three variables \\( (p, q, r) \\), and strictly following the specified rule, it does not meet the definition of a PCNF as it does not cover every situation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if it can be denoted in the described form.**\n\nGiven the analysis, since the formula does not cover all paired disjunctive terms for a full PCNF of three variables, it does not fit the full PCNF criteria.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[B]}\n\\]"}

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, SAP is false as it directly contravenes SEP.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific truth-values based on provided relationships and the direct negation/intent of universal and particular propositions' implications:\n\n[[true];[false];[false];[false]]\n\nThis conclusion adheres to the given rules and logical forms specified."}

Conversion: Exchange the subject and predicate to get \"All not-upright and not-open are not true revolutionaries\".\n\nHowever, to match the exact phrase \"All people who are not upright and open\", we can interpret the obversion as turning into the contrary, and simplifying the statement to reflect the original meaning after conversion.

The inference \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be symbolized as $!q \u2192 !p, but more closely aligns with being a direct transformation of the necessity to a specific form of impossibility, which directly corresponds to formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p once we correctly map the logical flow and understand that the negation and modal transformations align with turning necessity into a form that denies the possibility of the negation directly resulting. However, according to the specific inference asked from the given statement to the conclusion, the exact formula being matched directly in the modal logic inference formulas provided is #p \u2192 $p, which is formula (9). The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked."}

Since we're dealing with the negation structure, in terms of time relations, this takes the form of \"\u00acG\u00acp\", which by formula (16) is equivalent to \"Fp\".\n\nTherefore, for the first pair, we're dealing with \"Fp\" and \"Fp\", which, however, was not directly included in the given relationships but follows the logic implied by relationship (3) \u26ad, as it states that \"Fp and F\u00acp cannot both be false.\" The direct application here can be tricky, as it implies a self-relation that is true by the \u26ad rule, meaning it can both be true.\n\n(2) For \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\", we denote this as \"Gp\", a future period statement.\nFor \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\", which is more about a future point in time, we denote this as \"Fp\".\n\nLooking at the relationships defined:\n- The pair \"Gp and Fp\" fits the description of the fourth relationship (4) \u2042 which allows both statements to either be true or false simultaneously.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1) The first pair (Fp \u2194 Fp) falls under the \u26ad Relationship as they can both be true (as per (3)).\n(2) The second pair (Gp \u2194 Fp) fits the \u2042 Relationship as per rule (4).\n\nFinal Answer: [[C];[D]]"}

One group has salivary glands removed, and the other does not. Both groups are then bruised, and the result is observed. \n\n1. Positive group (with salivary glands intact): \n    - Salivary glands present, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal at a normal rate.\n2. Negative group (with salivary glands removed): \n    - Salivary glands absent, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal much slower.\n\nThis scenario closely matches Method \ua66e from the logic rule provided. Here, the salivary glands are the condition S, and the rate of wound healing is the outcome P. The positive group shows that when salivary glands are present (S), the wounds heal at a normal rate (P). The negative group shows that when salivary glands are absent (S'), the wounds heal slower (P'). Since the groups are identical in all other respects (A, B, C, D, E, F differing only in the salivary glands condition), the method is applied correctly, leading to the inference that salivary glands may have a causal relationship with the rate of wound healing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[C]]."}

In this method, we indirectly confirm the truth of the original proposition by refuting a contrary proposition. Here is a breakdown of the steps provided in the sequence:\n\n1. To prove: p (The original proposition we want to prove is \"p.\")\n2. Assume: Not p (We start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, which is \"not p.\")\n3. Prove: If Not p, then q (We determine what would follow if \"not p\" were true.)\n4. Not q (We then show that what follows under the assumption of \"not p\" is not true, i.e., \"q\" is not true.)\n5. Therefore, Not (Not p) (Since the assumption of \"not p\" leads to a contradiction (Not q when we assumed If Not p, then q), we conclude that the assumption \"not p\" cannot be true.)\n6. Therefore, p (Hence, the original proposition \"p\" must be true.)\n\nThis deductive reasoning follows the Contra- Method, meaning it indirectly proves the original proposition by showing that the assumption of its contrary proposition is false."}
