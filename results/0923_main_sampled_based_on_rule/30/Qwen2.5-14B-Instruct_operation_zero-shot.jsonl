Since 3 itself is not even, we need the next even number 4 to be considered for the calculation. Therefore, the even numbers involved in calculating the average for \\(3\\#X\\) will be those between 3 and \\(X\\) inclusive, with 3 being ignored since it is not even.\n\n- To get an average of 4, the sum of the even numbers divided by the count of even numbers must be 4.\n\nThe simplest ways to achieve an average of exactly 4 with even numbers starting from 4 include:\n\n1. If there is only one even number in the sequence (which is 4 if \\(X = 4\\)), the average would be 4.\n\nThus, \\(3\\#4\\) (where \\(X = 4\\)) involves only the number 4.\n\nLet's consider a few cases:\n\n- If the only even number is 4, then \\(4/1 = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, we find that the smallest \\(X\\) which fulfills the condition is \\(X = 4\\).\n\nThere could be higher values of \\(X\\) that maintain this specific average, but the simplest and smallest solution is \\(X = 4\\).\n\nWe need to ensure there are not other low values that fit too, but reviewing sequential even numbers from 4 to higher will show that adding more numbers will shift the average away from 4 unless another constraining rule is implied that we do not have.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ [[4]] \\]"}
