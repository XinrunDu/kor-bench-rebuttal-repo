Please provide the correct definitions of the operations \"★\" and \"◇\".\n\nResult of (4*2)◇5.\n\nWell, here’s how you would do it if “*” was actually “①” from the given rule and “◇” was actually “②” from the given rule:\n\nFirst, calculate 4①2:\n\n4①2 = √4 + 2² = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThen calculate 6②5:\n\n6②5 = √6 × 5\n\nTo get a numerical answer for the last part, we would need the exact value of √6, but at this point, the result is just an irrational number. So carrying out this question just using assumption that you meant what the given rule says, we have:\n\nResult = √6 × 5. Which is approximately: 12.247. \n\nBut if asterisks are meant to be asterisks, then square root of 4 is 2 and square of 2 is 4 then result is 6 which when input in second function you get 12.247.\n\nI apologize for previous statements, it seems I assumed the symbols for the actual operations without proper context. My apologies for any confusion caused. According to your latest instructions, here's what I can calculate:\n\nIf 4*2 is supposed to be (4①2), then (4①2) = sqrt(4) + 2^2 = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, if 5 is supposed to represent the second term in a new operation that follows the pattern set by 'a②b', then we follow the rule for 'a②b' which is sqrt(a) * b.\n\nTaking the result of (4①2) = 6, we now compute 6②5.\n\n6②5 = sqrt(6) * 5 => (sqrt meaning square root) => sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, thus 2.449 * 5 ≈ 12.247.\n\nFormally presenting the result: \n\n(4*2)②5 is approximately equal to 12.247. \n\nIt's crucial to understand that sqrt(6) can't be simplified further into whole numbers, that's why it's an irrational number. Let me know if you'd like me to go further into any steps or corrections!"}

And if you need the final answer in the format requested, [[sin(e) + 1/e]] should be the proper answer."}
