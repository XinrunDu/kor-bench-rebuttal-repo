We need to consider three cases:\n\n1. **If 25 is a multiple of X:**\n   \\[\n   Y = 25※X = \\frac{25}{X} + 2\n   \\]\n2. **If X is a multiple of 25:**\n   \\[\n   Y = 25※X = \\frac{X}{25} + 2\n   \\]\n3. **If neither 25 is a multiple of X nor X is a multiple of 25:**\n   \\[\n   Y = 25※X = 24\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Y※14 = 4\nWe now need to apply the operation rule to Y※14 and set it equal to 4.\n\n1. **If Y is a multiple of 14:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{Y}{14} + 2 = 4 \\implies \\frac{Y}{14} = 2 \\implies Y = 28\n   \\]\n2. **If 14 is a multiple of Y:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{Y} + 2 = 4 \\implies \\frac{14}{Y} = 2 \\implies Y = 7\n   \\]\n3. **If neither Y is a multiple of 14 nor 14 is a multiple of Y:**\n   \\[\n   24 = 4\n   \\]\n   This is not possible, so we can ignore this case.\n\n### Solving for X\nNow we have two possible values for Y: 28 and 7. We need to find X for each case.\n\n#### Case 1: Y = 28\n1. **If 25 is a multiple of X:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25}{X} + 2 = 28 \\implies \\frac{25}{X} = 26 \\implies X = \\frac{25}{26}\n   \\]\n   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.\n2. **If X is a multiple of 25:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{X}{25} + 2 = 28 \\implies \\frac{X}{25} = 26 \\implies X = 650\n   \\]\n   This is a valid integer solution.\n\n#### Case 2: Y = 7\n1. **If 25 is a multiple of X:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25}{X} + 2 = 7 \\implies \\frac{25}{X} = 5 \\implies X = 5\n   \\]\n   This is a valid integer solution.\n2. **If X is a multiple of 25:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{X}{25} + 2 = 7 \\implies \\frac{X}{25} = 5 \\implies X = 125\n   \\]\n   This is a valid integer solution.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe possible values for X are 5, 125, and 650.

First, identify the range of even numbers between 3 and X:\n   - For X to be a valid upper limit, it must be at least 4 (the first even number after 3).\n\n2. Calculate the average of all even numbers between 3 and X:\n   - The average of a set of consecutive even numbers is the midpoint of the first and last even number in the set.\n\nWe need to find X such that:\n- The even numbers between 3 and X are 4, 6, 8, ..., X (if X is even) or 4, 6, 8, ..., X-1 (if X is odd).\n- The average of these even numbers is 4.\n\nLet's test possible values of X:\n- If X = 4, the only even number between 3 and 4 is 4.\n  - Average = 4.\n\n- If X = 6, the even numbers between 3 and 6 are 4 and 6.\n  - Average = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5.\n\n- If X = 8, the even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4, 6, and 8.\n  - Average = (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 6.\n\n- If X = 10, the even numbers between 3 and 10 are 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n  - Average = (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 7.\n\n- If X = 12, the even numbers between 3 and 12 are 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n  - Average = (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12) / 5 = 8.\n\nFrom the above, the only value of X that makes the average of the even numbers between 3 and X equal to 4 is X = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[4]]"}

Then, \\( \\log_{X}{3} = \\frac{1}{y} \\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{y} + y = \\frac{17}{4} \\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( y \\) to clear the fraction, we obtain:\n\n\\[ 1 + y^2 = \\frac{17y}{4} \\]\n\nMultiplying through by 4 to clear the denominator, we get:\n\n\\[ 4 + 4y^2 = 17y \\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ 4y^2 - 17y + 4 = 0 \\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = -17 \\), and \\( c = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{(-17)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4}}{2 \\cdot 4} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{289 - 64}}{8} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{8} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 \\pm 15}{8} \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 + 15}{8} = \\frac{32}{8} = 4 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{17 - 15}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nSince \\( y = \\log_{3}{X} \\), we have two cases to consider:\n\n1. \\( \\log_{3}{X} = 4 \\) implies \\( X = 3^4 = 81 \\)\n2. \\( \\log_{3}{X} = \\frac{1}{4} \\) implies \\( X = 3^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\), which is not an integer.\n\nSince \\( X \\) must be a positive integer, the valid solution is:\n\n\\[ X = 81 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[81]]"}
