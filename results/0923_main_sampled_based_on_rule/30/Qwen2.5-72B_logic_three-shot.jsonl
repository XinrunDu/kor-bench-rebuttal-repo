Formulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn. A level A formula is the most fundamental proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures. A level B formula is a formula containing one logical connective, and the two connected propositions are both level A formulas. Other levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n is a natural number greater than or equal to 0).\n\n### Question:\nFor the answer, only give its level, without an text explanation. z1=1,x2=1,z3=1and Z1&Z2 and X1=X2 and ~(Y1=Y2),True assignment of formula: For assignment of propositions, if the formula is true, then we call this assignment a true assignment of the formula. If the formula is (~(Y1=Y2)&X1)||Z2=Z3, then x|x,x|x is a true assignment of the formula. False assignment of formula: For assignment of propositions, if the formula is false, then we call this assignment a false assignment of the formula. If the formula is (~(Y1=Y2)&X1)||Z2=Z3, then |x|x is a false assignment of the formula. Level A formula: Formula without logical connectives or nests. Example: p1=0. Level B formula: Formula containing one logical connective. Example: p1&p2. Level C formula: Formula contains nested logical connectives and at least one level B formula. Example: ~(p1&p2), formula with multiple levels of logical nesting. We classify an nth level connected formula as a level-(Z+n) formula (n is a natural number greater than 1), here is an example to compare: For the formula ~(X1=X2), it is a level C formula, and the formula z1'x = z' z2 is a level-(Z+1) formula. The former belongs to the en chain level, but there is no nesting. The value symbol Z represents the end of the chain level, implying a new level Z+1 initiates immediately after this point to accommodate higher nested and subscripted connections not covered by level Z. This distinction between chain levels and nested levels marks the beginning of the fine-tuning level conceptualization. True assignment of a formula: If the formula is a truth formula, then any assignment is a true assignment of the formula. For example the formula is ~(~(~(R1=R2||~S3=1))||~(~(~(Q1=Q1=Q3)||~P1=1||~M1=1))), then |x|x,|x|x,|x|\u2713|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x are true assignments of the formula. False assignment of a formula: For some formulas, there is only one false assignment.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]| [x|x]; [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [["}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven that (p1=::>(p1||p2))&((p1&p2)=::>p1) is a Truth Formula, determine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\n(2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A];[A]]"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: A]; [entirely incorrect: C]].\nProfessor Wang is from Suzhou.\nPerson A got all correct.\nPerson B got all incorrect.\nPerson C got half correct.\nAnd:\nA\u00da B\nUsing the Basic Equivalences, the above expression can be derived as:\n(!A & B) | (A & !B) | A | B\nThis is equivalent to:A | B\nSo the answer type should be like so:[].\n\n### Answer:\n\nA"}

If all S are P and all S are not P, this is a contradiction, as S cannot simultaneously fully be P and not be P. Therefore, this inference is invalid.\n\nB. If all S are P and all S are not P, it still presents a contradiction. S cannot be both a particular situation of P and wholly not P. This inference is invalid.\n\nC. If all S are P and all S are not P, it indicates that S is both completely within P and simultaneously outside of P. Hence, logically, S can only be a part of P. This inference is valid.\n\nD. Not all S are P means that some S are not P, but it does not mean that \"no S is P.\" The statement \"no S is P\" would signify that none of S has the property P, which is too strong a claim based on the given information.

SAP (All S are P) would be false because not all S can necessarily be P if only some are.\nB. SEP (No S is P) would be false because some S indeed are P.\nC. SOP (Some S is not P) would be true because if some S are P, then it's also true that some S are not P (though not all are P).\n\nTherefore, when SIP is true, the logical implication yields:\n- SAP is false.\n- SEP is false.\n- SOP is true.\n### Question:\nWhich of the following forms of logical inference is correct?\n\nA. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then all S are P.\n\nB. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then S is a particular situation of P.\n\nC. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then S is a part of P.\n\nD. Not all S are P, so no S is P.\n\nChoose from the following options:\nA. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then all S are P.\n\nB. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then S is a particular situation of P.\n\nC. If all S are P, and all S are not P, then S is a part of P.\n\nD. Not all S are P, so no S is P.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Explanation:\n\nA. If all S are P and all S are not P, this is a contradiction, as S cannot simultaneously fully be P and not be P.

Turn the oven to 375\u00b0, and spread the mixture on a baking sheet to roast, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned (10 minutes). In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of low-fat or whole-milk yogurt, 3/4 cup of raw sugar, 1/2 cup of each water and fresh, thawed frozen, or canned pineapple, then bring just to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and boil, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons each of vanilla and almond extract. Meanwhile, cut 2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 3/4-inch-wide strips, put the strips in a 13- by 9-inch baking dish, and distribute the nut mixture among the strips. Pour the yogurt mixture over the contents. Bake the chicken in the lower third of the oven until it is just cooked through, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve it hot with rice or couscous, or chilled.\n### Response:\nWith the fresh, zesty flavors of citrus, zest, and pine nuts, this chicken dish is a delightful ode to the flavors of the Mediterranean. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0 F (or 180\u00b0 C) and combine 1/4 cup each of chopped walnuts and pine nuts in a saucepan. Gently toast over low heat, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes to bring out their natural oils. Once lightly golden, let them cool and then transfer to a medium bowl along with 3 tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice, 1 teaspoon of bright and refreshing lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon of pine nuts, if desired. Add in 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/2 cup well-stirred crumbled skim milk feta cheese, tossing everything together lightly. Get two moistened paper towels ready, and on a cutting board, place 1 pound of sliced chicken breasts or thighs. Pat them dry all over with paper towels and lightly season with salt and pepper. Mine out your zesty marinade mixture, spread it evenly on both sides of the chicken, and place the chicken on an aluminum foil-wrapped 18-inch square rimmed baking sheet. Tuck your fresh and crisp lemon slices around the chicken and wrap it tightly with the foil. Roast the chicken in the center of the oven for about 1 hour, transferring it to a cutting board and letting it rest for 15 minutes. Let's revisit the reserved marinating liquids after removing the off-cuts, bringing them to a boil over high heat, and cooking until they are reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Let the broth cool for a few minutes before pouring in 3/4 cup of your favorite Trader Joe's canned chicken broth, whisking to combine before adding in 1/3 cup of tiny, crowd-pleasing chickpeas and two chopped green onions. Once done, let the flavorful blend rest for about 10 minutes. Serve with the desired amount of fragrant, crunchy pignoli crusted chicken breasts, drizzling over the rich and savory sauce, serving hot. After cooking and serving, we eagerly anticipate the hearty and flavorful aroma of this dish. Bon app\u00e9tit! Above 220\u00b0 F or 110\u00b0 C but under 250\u00b0 F or 140\u00b0 C.\n\n### Corrected Answer:\n\n1.

{"idx": "170", "question": "Research has shown that the impact of family education styles on children's emotional intelligence varies across cultures. Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions.

Vegans strictly engage in a plant-based diet and do not consume any animal products. Omnivores consume both plant and animal products, while carnivores predominantly consume animal-based foods. Upon systematic analysis of these three dietary patterns and their association with health metrics across these groups, we observe the following:\n\n- Vegans, with their plant-based diet, generally exhibit lower risks for obesity, heart disease, and high cholesterol, along with potential benefits in reducing the risk of certain cancers. However, vegan diets may require careful planning to avoid nutrient deficiencies, such as Vitamin B12, which is primarily obtained from animal sources.\n- Omnivores, with a balanced approach to their diet, tend to have an average health profile. They can consume a wide range of nutrients from both plant and animal sources, promoting overall health and potentially reducing risks of certain nutrient deficiencies. However, an imbalanced intake of fats (e.g., high amounts of saturated and trans fats from animal sources) can increase the risk of chronic diseases.\n- Carnivores, focusing almost exclusively on animal-based foods, have a diet high in protein and certain nutrients like iron and zinc. However, an excessive intake of red and processed meats has been linked to increased risks of heart disease, hypertension, and certain cancers. This group may also have a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies in certain areas, such as fiber, which is mainly found in plant sources.\n\nBased on these observations, which of the following statements best aligns with the nutritional principle \"We are what we eat\" from a causal analysis perspective?\n\nA. Diet composition, whether plant-based, balanced, or animal-dominant, does not substantially impact health outcomes.\nB. A strictly plant-based diet is required to achieve optimal health.\nC. Unmoderated consumption of animal-based foods is necessary for good health.\nD. A balanced diet, including both plant and animal-based foods, can provide necessary nutrients and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\nE. Any single diet pattern is sufficient to guarantee health benefits without considering its components.\n\nChoose the option that best answers the question based on the context provided.

Specifically, analyze the potential causes of hypochondria in physically strong individuals, contrasted with those in the general population. Provide a comparative reasoning framework and reach a definitive conclusion. If you cannot determine the correlation, respond with \"correlation undetermined.\"\n\n### Answer:\n\nWhen physically strong individuals experience hypochondria, it may be due to three reasons:\n\n1. Their physical strength may foster psychological strength, leading to a sense of control and mastery. The physiological manifestation of psychological symptoms like anxiety is often more pronounced in individuals with stronger physiques. When these psychological symptoms become physical, they may interpret them as signs of illness due to their heightened sensitivity to bodily changes.\n2. The biological foundation of physical strength and bodily awareness is also more developed than in weaker individuals. When physical health is compromised, it can lead to an overreactive reflex known as hypochondria.\n3. Physically strong individuals may experience emotional tensions due to societal pressure or internal struggles related to conflicts between cognitive and motor systems. These emotional tensions can manifest as physical discomfort, leading to a greater perception of bodily distress.\n\nIn the general population, hypochondria may occur due to various factors such as:\n1. Individual personality traits and psychological disorders.\n2. Fleeting psycho-pathological states during illness, which are often not depicted.\n3. Physical and social stressors experienced by women from childhood, which leave long-term emotional scars and may pose a risk to women's psychological balance.\n4. The expectation for perfect physical form may lead some to excessively scrutinize their bodies for flaws, contributing to hypochondria.\n\nUpon comparing the two types of hypochondria, we find that they share a common underlying mechanism. Both result from the nervous system's activation in response to the body's needs, leading to an overinterpretation of internal sensations and feelings as signs of illness. However, physically strong individuals might have a more physiological starting point, while the general population might have more psychological and socio-cultural conditions.\n\nTherefore, both physically strong individuals and the general population can experience hypochondria.

Li Gua did not murder his boss, so Li Gua is not an evil person. This reasoning is obviously unsound. The act of murder (regardless of whether it is the boss) can indeed make a person an evildoer, but evildoers are not limited to murderers; there are many other forms of wrongdoing.

Thousands of items in museum collections worldwide are attributed to only one person, although that attribution may have been made long ago and may be outdated. All art historians have experienced the discomfort of claiming that an unknown artist painted a portrait of an unknown sitter. Discovering more information about the artists and their subjects is because these objects are collectibles now such a huge industry apart from and independent of the art objects themselves. In recent years, forensic scientists have developed methods to assist art historians in their inquiries. Scientific examination can assist in establishing an artist's identity by determining what the object was made of, how it was constructed, and, thus, when it was made. However, experts have cautioned that these techniques will not assist in solving all attribution issues.\n\nFirst revised question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion above?\n\nA. Determining when an object was made is just as important as ascertaining who made it.\nB. The best way to discover more about any art object is to apply as many scientific techniques to it as are appropriate.\nC. Some questions can be resolved only by the application of scientific analysis to the object at issue.\nD. The application of scientific analysis to art objects is primarily a matter of practical necessity.\nE. Art historians, like forensic scientists, should integrate a variety of techniques to achieve their goals.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\n\nSecond revised question: It can be concluded from the information above that most art historians prefer which of the following methods of attributing art objects to artists?\n\nA. Definitively deprive famous artists of attributions that are clearly not theirs\nB. As objectively accurate as possible\nC. As fair to the interests of museum trustees as possible\nD. At most a guess as to who made an object according to the amount of investigation involved\nE. At the very least, based on the provenance of the object\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D/E]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}
