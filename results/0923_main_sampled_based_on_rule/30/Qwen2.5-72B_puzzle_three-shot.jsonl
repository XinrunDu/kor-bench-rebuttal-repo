Rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   I + 11B = 100I + 11L\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11L = 11B - 99I\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L = B - 9I\n   \\]\n\n3. We need to find values for \\(I,\\) \\(B,\\) and \\(L\\) that satisfy the above equation and the rules of the problem.\n   - Since \\(L\\) must be a single digit (0-9) and \\(I\\) cannot be zero, \\(I\\) must be a single digit from 1 to 9.\n   - Also, \\(B\\) must be a single digit from 0 to 9.\n\n4. Given the constraint \\(L = B - 9I\\), \\(B\\) must be at least \\(9I\\) since \\(L\\) must be a non-negative digit.\n\nTest possible values:\n- If \\(I = 1\\):\n  - Then \\(L = B - 9\\)\n  - To keep \\(L\\) as a single digit, \\(B\\) must be between 9 and 9 (inclusive), but \\(B\\) cannot equal \\(I\\), so this case fails.\n\n- If \\(I = 1\\) and \\(B = 9\\):\n  - Then \\(L = 9 - 9 = 0\\)\n  - This works because all digits are unique and fit within the required range.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\\[\nI = 1, \\quad B = 9, \\quad L = 0\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[I=1,B=9,L=0]]"}

Every square in the grid contains an integer from 1 to 15, and all integers from 1 to 15 appear exactly once.\n3. Among these spaces, 10 are black squares and cannot be moved. The remaining 5 are white squares and can be moved.\n4. There are 14 operations in total, represented as (a,b) > (c,d), where (a,b) represents the square at row a, column b. If square (a,b) is blank or square (c,d) is occupied, this is an illegal operation.\n   * The result of this operation is swapping squares (a,b) and (c,d).\n   * A square can appear at most once in two operators in the 14 operations. In other words, the 5 white squares will appear exactly twice in the 14 operators.\n   * If the square that appears at row a, column b is blank, this is an illegal operation.\n5. Adjacent squares (a,b) and (c,d) have the following rules:\n   * If a = c and d = b+1 ⇒ move square (a,b) to the right to swap with square (c,d).\n   * If a = c and d = b-1 ⇒ move square (a,b) to the left to swap with square (c,d).\n   * If b = d and c = a+1 ⇒ move square (a,b) down to swap with square (c,d).\n   * If b = d and c = a-1 ⇒ move square (a,b) up to swap with square (c,d).\n6. In a situation where a single empty space remains after movements, this position is called the target position. The rules are as follows:\n   * If the previous movement was in the right direction, then the target position appears at the far right of that row. The square from the leftmost position of that row is moved to the target position.\n   * If the previous movement was in the left direction, then the target position appears at the far left of that row. The square from the rightmost position of that row is moved to the target position.\n   * If the previous movement was downward, the target position appears at the bottom of that column. The square from the top position of that column is moved to the target position.\n   * If the previous movement was upward, the target position appears at the top of that column. The square from the bottom position of that column is moved to the target position.\n7. Fill in the contents of the empty spaces.\n\n### Question:\n1 X X X X\nX 7 X 8 X\nX X 13 X X\n\n(1,2)>(2,2)\n(2,3)>(3,3)\n(3,2)<(3,3)\n(2,2)>(2,3)\n(2,4)>(3,4)\nHint: 6,9,2\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

tents.\n5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.\n6.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.\n7.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, and X, which represents the spaces,To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X T X X T X 3\nX T X X X X X X X X 1\nX X X T T X X X X X 3\nT X X X X X T T X X 1\nX T X X T X X X X X 2\n2 1 1 1 1
