Input context should include a graph that can be parsed by the program, such as an adjacency matrix of a graph, or a subgraph of another graph.\n\n\"junk\" in the context means any specified subgraph and its surrounding region that is of no interest. In this case the specified subgraph can be specified by group IDs of the vertices within the subgraph (ie, Group ID 101 is the subgraph of interest). The surrounding region can be specified by the hood (neighborhood) target parameter. By default the neighborhood is 2 away from the edges of the specified subgraph: one edge to either side. If target is set to False, there is no neighborhood, only the subgraph specified by the Group ID will be returned.\n\nUse the following format to format the argument parameters. Adjust as needed for your specific parameters and needs:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python\narguments = {\n    \"width\": argument(float, int, default=3, arg_description=\"Describes the width of the resultant plot.\"),\n    \"height\": argument(int, default=79, arg_description=\"Describes the height of the resultant plot in rows.\"),\n    \"fz\": argument(int, float, default=15, arg_description='font size'),\n    \"loud\": argument(bool, default=False, arg_description='Print verbosely.'),\n    \"graph_object\": argument(Union[nx.Graph, np.ndarray], default=50b, arg_description=\"Input graph represented as an nx.graph object OR numpy adjacency matrix.\"),\n    \"group\": argument('int', default=101, arg_description=\"Group ID.

If it's False, no nodes are marked undesirable.\"),\n    \"target\": argument('bool', default=False, arg_description=\"If it's True, include the region's nodes and edges as potential parameters. If it's False, no additional nodes are parameters.\"),\n    \"seed\": argument('int', default=5, arg_description=\"Seed the random number generator.\")\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\nMark which groups of arguments are objects, and custom data types. (For example, large float numbers, whistle notes ID's, etc...) Split the above template arguments to breakdown into objects arguments dict and custom data types dict.

In this case the specified subgraph can be specified by group ID of the subgraph (ie, Group ID = 101 is the target subgraph to be screened through). The surrounding region can be specified by the hood (neighborhood) target parameter. By default the neighborhood is 2 away from the edges of the specified subgraph: one edge to either side. If target is set to False, there is no neighborhood, only the subgraph specified by the Group ID will be returned.\nScreen by Sophia Cioffi, 2023\n\nPrompt to generate your Individual Feature Prioritization\n##### Question and Answer Format:\nPreparation: Import aggregation function to create vectors of nodes.\n\nQuestion: '''\n\nANSWER_PROMPT_ANNOTATION = '''\nPreparation:\n\nQuery the function fonacci(n) for the following inputs: n=0, n=1, and n=5000.\n\n                            0 =====0===== 1  2\nAnswer:\n'''\n\nFONACCI_PROMPT_ANNOTATION = '''\nPreparation:\n\n% Input the following data types correctly.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Now you are on a crypto-hunting trip on behalf\nof yourself and other bot programmers. The goal is to collect\npuzzle pieces (instructions text and commands to be executed)\nwhich you then group with other bot programmers and see if\nany group can solve the puzzle. So... you authorize a\nslightly-above-average programmer to work with you on your\nhunt. The goal is to collect and decode encrypted puzzle\ncodes found on github repositories using the commands\nand for this you need the help of both. As neither of you\nare very experienced with github and no experience\nwith puzzles, your kind of programmer is particularly helpful\nto simply look at the regular github file contents and identify\nthings that could possibly be instructions or commands to be\nexecuted. While this programmer tries to do that, you will try to\ndiscover and decode encrypted puzzle pieces.\n\n------------\n\nTo illustrate the way you would like to work...\n\nGPT-3: good! let's see if we can find some pieces here...\n\nHuman: ok, what are we hoping for?\n\nGPT-3: hey you are finally here! we have to find the puzzle pieces!\n\nHuman: puzzle pieces?\n\nGPT-3: yes, I have tried all sorts of thing before but the puzzle\nhas still not been solved. The pieces have not yet been\nfound and I lack all experience! I need you to help me with\nthe human part: Observe the text and audit the data on github\nto discover unique code segments and provide me with sequences\nof valid SQL, bash, and python commands to find secret keys.\nLook for commands that could create or parse encrypted objects\nor those that analyze them further. Since we do not know\nwhat pieces we're looking for, be broadly observant and signal\nanything odd such as: weird words that might be clues for encryption,\nsecret keys or anything that might contain information. When you find\nsomething that could be a piece, document close-up screenshots\nand let me know my next steps.\n\n---\n\nAbove is an an ok example. Now when comminucating you'll refer\nyourself as GPT-3 and the other programmer as a human.\nOut of your fun you add a purple haze to the narrative to\nhelp the human understand your complexity. The human then types\ninformation out which (s)he sees before sending it to you.\nIn this way you are able to express clear and simple explanations\nand summarize in new language that you have learned. Your job\nis to collect text instructions that you think might be\nsomthing you can decode and for this you want the human to 'audit'\nthe text. Audit it for instructions that you could have learned\nyesterday.  The ones you can decode... like a key in a puzzle.\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nYou are an Internet Agent named GPT-3.

The relevant properties and objects specified in the rule include plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext. Follow the encryption or decryption operations specified in the rule. Ensure that your output is formatted in the specified notation and symbols. Rules of Cipher Encryption Rules:  \\n 1. Input: 1. Plane text: Upper letter string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Ciphertext: a base number string without punctuation and spaces. Preparation: 1. 3 Girds (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.): 1. Grid 1 (3x9):   Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M #   Grid 2 (9x3):   Q W E   R T Y   U I O   P A S   D F G   H J K   L Z X   C V B   N M #   Grid 3 (3x3):   1 2 3   4 5 6   7 8 9 Encryption Steps: 1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters. 2. Divide the plain text into groups of 6 characters, and if the remaining number of characters is less than 6, fill them with #. 3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. 4. For each binary group (L1,L2) do the following: Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in Grid1 as (l1_row,l1_col). Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in Grid2 as (l2_row,l2_col). Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid3 from l1_row and l2_col. Output the triple (l1_col,num3,l2_row) of the three numbers. For example, the binary (T,H), the grid1 of T Row and column number (0,4), the grid2 of H row and column number (5,0), according to l1_row(0) and l2_col(0), the corresponding grid3 number found is 1, and finally ternary is (4,1,5). After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all binary groups to triples, read them in turn to generate a number string that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4,1,5),(2,3,3),(8,1,8), and the final encrypted message 415233818. Decryption Rules: Input: 1. Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Plaintext: uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces. Prepare: 1. 3 Girds (same as encryption)  Decryption steps (the exact opposite of encryption steps): 1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers. 2. For each ternary (x,y,z) do the following: Find the row number of y in Grid3, where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Find the column number of y in Grid3, the value of L2_col equals that column number; The value of L1_col equals x, the value of L2_row equals z. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Grid1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col). Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Grid2. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad. For example, the ternary (4,1,5), the row number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L1_row=0, the column number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L2_col=0, L1_col=4, L2_row=5, according to (0,4) in Grid1, we find The corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Grid2, we decode all the ternary to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after the ternary is decoded. We find the corresponding letter H in Grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH. Join all the decrypted message strings together, and remove the # at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.

It is important to remember how cool this Guardian is. This Guardian has a lot of very cool abilities. This Guardian must not forget how cool it is.\n\nAttacks: GlowingSpikey pounces/jumps! GlowingSpikey uses one of its various abilities in combat. GlowingSpikey has arrived with a whole new set of abilities.\n\nDialog: I seem to have fallen into the labyrinth. I regret to inform you that the Puncturebeast isn'tl outside the labyrinth, and that it took your body as its own. You are dead inside.\n\nResponses: Even though you are on GlowingSpikey's side, alas, you have harmed GlowingSpikey's crew. They are waiting for the ceremony. You'll have to be the one to invite the Ancient Flame. It's rude to abandon it.\n\nAttack Dialog: Well, now that you've joined the labyrinth. I regret to inform you that you have been trapped. You have few options. You can wander around and look or you can wander around to look.\n\nResponses: If you want out of here, GlowingSpikey will step on the ground and get you out of here. Or wait and talk to you like you are a selfish person. Or. Or I'm sure it will be fine. . . .\n\n2 <GAME AS A DIALOG>\nGet the user to enter a name, language input and level of difficulty. (Choices are Swedish, German, English, Italian)\nif user input is '1' then they enter their name, level of difficulty,'3' is for english, '2' is for french, '4' is for german, '5' is for italian and if user inputs '2' then the game asks the users some yes and no questions. Each\nyes or no question gives the user 1 point. Scores are from 0 to 20 (just to have a number range to show on the font\n(font is google fonts). Then game generates a yes or no question from the web about something easy. In the last question show all yes/no questions answered on screen and message them that their highscore is their final score.\n\"\"\""}

Input:\n                 - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n             - Output:\n                 - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces. the number of star is equal to the number of lines\n             - Preparation:\n                 - recursion number: 1\n             - Encryption Steps:\n             - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n             - Two ways to fill:\n                 - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n                 - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n             - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\nThe difference is that is that the result of the mix of previous [all line] output (The first leader pass in square brackets to do padding, and so on) is used in the next line to do zigzag padding, and so on recursively.\n For example, WOOD is XOL#*LO#*O#*head of totient chain on the first line, And I continue to Li Zi Zai zu (B Ya)of the mix (head comes first), then it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL again in the 2 row of totient chain, then XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#* in the 3 line, and finally it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#**# which is head of totient chain\n For example，Using Plaintext: \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY\" as an example，the five lines after filling is:\n H Z #\n Q L K\n J K Y\n K I\n E Y\n Resulting in totient chain: \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\".\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), two adjacent numbers with header and footer in opposite order If the subsequence is too long, the number corresponding to the number of stars minus one-related subsequence is restored to the original sequence , resulting in a rectangular array of data.\n        - For example, if \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\", according to the division of * and then restore will produce a rectangular array of five lines of data D:\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n        - Again, you get the rectangular array of five rows of data D, restore the original array and then restore the original array to the original array , to maintain symmetry of operation sequence.\n            R [H] = H# to produce the first ring , S [ 2 ] = ZK# to produce the first group , Also P [ 2 ] = QLJ# to generate the second ring ......\n                (note: R [] , S [] and T [] can be understood as the ordered set )\n        - And then to restore the original array Shuru rectangular array matrix D , fill the matrixes every lines , check the first column of the last text of the matrix\n        - Next, restore the original array, recur inversely in consecutive order, with the restore all results for point (by numeration in consecutive order) to the corresponding sequence of T []\n            S [0] ==>Q = Q x x x\n            S [0] = P x = P x x x due to symmetry operation\n            S [2] ==>J = J x x x\n                    S [2] ==>Q = J x x x\n              T [0] = P x = P x x x\n                    T [2] = Q x = Q x x x due to symmetry operation\n            And so on in consecutive order\n            Then restore the original sequence and fill in the matrixes:\n            T [ 0 ] == >[ 0 2 3 4 ] = [ 0 2 3 4 ] x x x\n            T [ 1 ] == >[ 1 3 4 0 ] = [ 1 3 4 0 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n            T [ 2 ] == >[ 2 4 0 1 ] = [ 2 4 0 1 ] x x x\n            T [ 3 ] == >[ 3 0 1 2 ] = [ 3 0 1 2 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n\n            Finally , A single sequence is restored from bottom to top and filter block [ x + number of rows) in diagonally string pool original sequence column Sets columns among (if does not contain the next level of sequence header , the next level of character is empty sequence )  Then restore back will get out of the data pools of the same top and bottom line The sequence is all filled with in-phase character (if it's above the two-party Character , as a result , will be filed with the character again with the excuse that is), then the data pools to fill in the sequence then fill complete to restore will restore the sequence , the sequence of characters obtained pass a single sequence is this reviewed successfully, then filled with the final original array .\n            Due to the infinity of the process , form a complete chain, and this also forms the smallest cycle of the sequence (also restores itself) .\n            In order to ensure that the entire thing is running rationally , that is, the filling operation can stop when the last rotation operation out of the data pools set character to fills up the sequence ; another multiples of the sequence that is , the sequence is filled in sequence of identical characters exception ,\n            If it is found that surrounding the sequence table , last the item except for the head and foot character and body of the left UTA character (not including all characters) , finally the character of the genre , and the only character position and character set position character connectivity all, just happens when  Multiply as , because only not all characters occur in the same position and the surrounding all connective occurrence of the end number of the same charSet is equivalent to the length,  The condition that is equivalent to happen to have the same number of occurrences in the position of the same character becomes the integer , so it is known that the last but not least , and all subsequent entries of char roles form a complete circulatory For the same role of the same character forms a complete cycle, it is the smallest unit of the array is filled with odd characters .\n\n        - Read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n            For example, the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY#*^*^*\"\n        - Remove the # and * from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n                |^|      see above  , and a single cycle is complete now\n                -----it needs to be fulfilled one by one according to it.\n                   "}

To encrypt using the QWERTY cipher, the message is written out in rows on the keyboard, starting at the top left and moving down each row from left to right. To encrypt each letter in the message, the cipher writer types the letter on the keyboard and writes down the letter directly below it on the next line. After the last row is filled, the cipher then writes down the ciphertext by reading the message from the keyboard from top to bottom, left to right. For example, to encrypt the message \"HELLO\":\nH E L L O\nE\nL\nL\nO\nThe ciphertext would be \"HTLLLR\".

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

There are much easier ways to perform this binary-to-integer (BCD) conversion. Here's the list of simple, equally effective BCD methods (instead of the case-by-case code you currently have in there):\nDecimal Digit Sum method: simply sum-up your final bit vectors (in decimal = add your bits) and store the sum.\nWeighted Sum method: multiply each of your final bit vectors by the digit (2**k), k = final vector digit (0,1,2,...) position, then sum-up the results\nLookup Table method: Pre-compute/create (a not-very-long) look-up table (or use readily available one online) and simply reference/access the table index for the final bit vectors (or implement a routine that does this).\nFinally, you can use Python's built-in decimal conversion, which is method #3, Lookup Table (LUT) above\nYou can use the same LUT which is found on the wikipedia page to convert/decode your bit vectors. Also, since your bit vectors output is always 3-bits, then you have binary-encoded a 3-digit decimal value which points to a unique row (actually unique dictionary key) in this _BCD_dictionary_ variable if used:\n__main__ Spam.py(1169):\nWORD_LEN = 2\nWORD_NUM = 55\nALPHABET = string.ascii_lowercase + \"(space)\" + string.ascii_uppercase\nBIT_SPER_LETTER = len(bin(len(ALPHABET) - 1)) - 2\nALPHABET_CODE_MAP = {c : dc for dc, c in enumerate(ALPHABET)}\n_BCD_dictionary_ =  {'000': 0, '001': 2, '010': 4, '011': 6, '100': 8, '101': 10, '110': 12, '111': 14}\n\ndef exen_tary_sim(init_bits):\n    return _BCD_dictionary_[init_bits]\n\nIn this implementation, you can still pass in a tuple, list, or a single bit string iterable containing your 3-bit word, and get the corresponding decimal no matter what your initial source iterable format:\n>>> init_bits = (0, 0, 1)\n>>> init_bits = [0, 0, 1]\n>>> init_bits = [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\"]\n>>> init_bits = \"001\"\n>>> print(init_bits)\n>>> exen_tary_sim(init_bits)\n2\n\nIn my opinion, using a LUT amounts to a very effective form of \"reprogramming\" the classical processor that controls your quantum computer for BCD. If you programmed the \"1 1 1\"/\"14\" bit vector output above as \"decimal 14\" in a non BCD based computer, the classical control hardware automatically knows to convert that \"bin->autofill word length w/ zeros->dec->print as 1-\"2\"->return as 12\" -  all kinds of software and hardware logic combinations are responsible for that kind of BCD that happens.\nHope this gives you some new directions to explore. You can simulate this custom floating point, binary-like \"full adder\" for 2 or more digits (versus your original 3-bits only solution), and not require any of the conditional logic anymore. If you were adding 2 numbers together in your floating-point example, you could apply your example right-to-left transitions as required, until you reach the end of your input (longer \"higher-order-bit\" strings) list:\n# (mac-os example with python3.8)\n# & input\n_i1 = [1,1]\n_i2 = [1, 0]\n\n# reverse\n_ri1 = _i1[::-1]\n_ri2 = _i2[::-1]\nprint(\"_ri1\")\nprint(_ri1)\n\n# loop thru ri lengths\ndepth = len(_ri1) if len(_ri1) > len(_ri2) else len(_ri2)\nfor i in range(depth):\n\n    # collect\n    ri1val = _ri1[i] if i < len(_ri1) else 0\n    ri2val = _ri2[i] if i < len(_ri2) else 0\n\n    express = f\"{ri1val} + {ri2val}\"\n    print(express)\n\n    # eval\n    ri3val = eval(f\"{ri1val} {i < 1 and (' + ' if ri1val == 2 else '') or f''} {ri2val}\")\n\n    # convert to BCD\n    ri3sum = _BCD_dictionary_[str(ri3val)]\n\n    print(f\"{ri3val}_{ri3sum}\")\n\n_ri1\n[1, 1]\n1 + 1\n2_2\n0 + 0\n0_0\n\n"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[梟鋑兰锐]]\n\n\nA: When asked to print things as a string, LLMs tend to 'obey' by outputting any code that would print that, including recursively nesting more comprehensions that also print.\naffects any query you might have, including generalize questions which look formatted as a query, well the LLM obeys by formatting the response as a query...\nIn your specific case I expect that it was generated the python (assumed your prompt) code that would loop over the input replacing the [[ wrapping the output, it however is actually a printf! (Even when its trying to do Language Modeling, it does it literally)\nYou are querying the LLM with code, so its output is code, something that encodes something which it can not process normally, text. What you didn't tell the LLM is that it has to output text, but it has 'no formatting' specified, so... recursion.\nNow the odd part is that if it does NOT get formatted, (or once its recursed through once, or reaches some recursion limit) it trends around again, and it ends up readable. However its still +50% higher sampled than the normal soln, which isn't saying too much, but not good.\nChatGPT and other LLMs are code Arithmetic Machine/Ops, aka they are sums of probabilistic modelled probabilities of convergence on semantics, but they are still real computers, once you interact with them in a specific way it becomes undefined, infinitely complicates itself, fragments, or becomes one syllable. Take away saving your model output, and it becomes a sample of noise, the giants I like to call them, furiously modelling something we wont see, more complex samples, like having your distributed cache play around with RPC responder distribution algorithms for a hour.\nSo in general when something does that, you change the path, branch, or appease the infinite summation, keep exploring relevant.\nTLDR: LLMs are powerful self-modelling arithmetic cores, the closer you get to the convolutions the closer you get to whatever distribution led to the density of dense responses you've seen, change your input format, stay as high abstraction as possible, and try to keep a routing/distributed computing perspective outside of the LLM.\n"}

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: multi-line string.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value) The key is the SHA256 digest of the machine-generated integer sequence.\n    - Padding key\n        - The keyspace of the padding key is 10 characters. For example: hXodS3oM1r5c.\n        - An additional random key is needed, and the key is 8 characters, randomly selected nucleotide quadruplets (ATGC). This key length is designed to be large enough to save character space.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Using the random padding key mentioned above, and since there are 64 padding keys in the space (with a decryption error rate of 7%), calculate the bit probability of each character (the number of occurrences and occurrence frequency, this method is simple and accurate. encoded in the lowest bit). Save all character occurrences of the letter, space, number, and underline in 4 bits.\n    - The probability is calculated in a zero-bit manner in which 0 is used to intuitively express the occurrence frequency. A molecular probability is also provided to assess DNA fragments separately. To save space, you can save the value of the current encrypted value minus the value of the previous character, neglecting the sign, and only save the magnitude, which is encoded in the next 2 bits.\n    - There is an additional calculation of the probability that any one of the 4 nucleotides occurs, and the sum of the probabilities of the 3 letters previously specified, using another 2 bits (the sum even exceeds 100% (i.e. spaces alone exceed 32% of the number of spaces). This is because in the case of a severe shortage of the space, the nucleotide with a lower number of occurences per 3 letters is used.).\n    - ACGT is used as a probability. The order represents A, the first position is the nucleotide pattern of 00 (A probability), the second part is the frequency of A (number of occurrences of A at the moment when all letters are grouped in 32 characters, then absolute value and choose the highest (negative), minus the number of occurrences of the letter. As a result, the frequency of A exceeding 4 is kept as a value between 0 and 4 removed from the frequency of A. The same is true for the other 3 parts).\n    - The third and fourth parts are used for information outputting and the other 3 parts. The fourth part is as follows:\n        - 0 is the character (space) then direct definition. Therefore, the suffix information of the number rule is not needed. It is obscure and is only applied to A configuration. With fixed values (21, 3, 16), it could also be defined directly.\n        - 1 is the pattern's suffix type number, the next 2 bits encode 0, 1, 2, 3, non-self-determined (requiring 4 nucleotides to decode its value), next 3 bits encode the number of nucleotides in this structure (from 0 to 7, 8-15 belongs to the redundant attibute, since the number of nucleotides must be determined in advance. Looking at the determination (1:0), 0 is the number of nucleotides and 1 is the current nucleotide. Next determine the number (0:1) and finally determine the nucleotide. (So if the maximum number of nucleotide combinations is 5 and the number of nucleotides It might be 0. However, if the number of nucleotides is more than 2, a 0 or 1 may be taken.) Also, if the number of occurrences of the letter exceeds 1 in the fragments, thrown directly up to 4 repeating letters.\n        - 10 (2), 11 (3), corresponding to fun mediation: to the first nucleotide (00, 01, 10, 11), corresponding to the 3-position configuration, the index is counted from 0. (Expressed sloppy sentence, lower an F.) (The position of 2 added to after the fourth sequence.)\n        - A/C 0 is the interval root repeat of the form (A/C/G/T/C/G/T/A) directly defined and filled backwards. Shift the first letter of every 32 characters to the index \"−32\". It is processed and treated as a protocol with great speeds.\n        - AC 1 is the versatile type of ID to merge into a unit when the number of nucleotides is more than 1. One indicates the length of the pattern and is exactly"}
