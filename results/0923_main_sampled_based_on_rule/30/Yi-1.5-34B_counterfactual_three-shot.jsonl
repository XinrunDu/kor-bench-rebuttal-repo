Your presence is electric, with a white hot gaze that can both light up a room and burn up illusions. You are always ready to explore, talk, and have experiences. Your zodiac sign is also marked by a keen analytical edge and bundles of nervous excitement. Being twins yourself, you are never undersold on novelty. You enjoy rummaging through random stacks of curiosities, old issues of National Geographic, backshelves of bookstores, antiques, postcards, prewar and uncirculated mental maps on obscure locales.\n\nA psychic once read your future in what turned out to be the middle of a crunch barrel. They described to you a crystal, a velvety yet toxic world peopled by tiny ornamental microbes. They, with their black eyes like obsidian pills, have mastered the alchemy of objects into feelings.\n\n### Question:\nA psychic told you that one day, you'll find an orange ball in a pile of old National Geographic magazines that you were rummaging through.

It has multiple supporting statements for each option. Reframe the answer to the question as a direct question on which to make a decision. Today is the 26th of April 2023.\nMae O'Reilly wants her customers' experiences at Market to be as positive as possible, but sometimes people call her and swear at her. She knows that she can't build something lasting on appeasement, but she's also aware that bad reviews and social media posts about angry customers can tarnish her reputation. Should she cave in to the demand of one angry customer and uphold the values she wished the store to uphold?\n\n### Rules:\nMarket doesn't operate in Nordstrom's tradition of creating customer experiences by soothing their immediate grievances with monetary compensation. They don't know who pays for whom, and they lost 22% of their stock when Sam's Club opened. Mae likes their slight-of-hand skills, using stuff from around Market to skate around people's crises. Supporting Connie, who has worked for Market for twenty years, is also a matter of principle at the center of the company. [[Mae wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.\nThey also value Connie's paid to fill in time, and caving in in response to the demand of one angry customer is not something they want to promote.]] [[opponent wanted: Appeasing the angry customer by refunding the socks. Supporting Connie over the man's decision.]]\nSupporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company. Neither Sam nor Connie has friends who work for Market, and another customer will surely walk in with a friendly reference. The principle of protecting the staff is one that is not going to diminish. [[Mae wanted: To give Connie a job at Market. To let the impossible-to-please customers go.]] [[opponent wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.]] [[prospects for further order: To allow Connie to return to her rightful position.]]\n\n### Option 1:\nMae W.: I've just received a call from a customer who is threatening to post on Facebook saying we have filthy socks and that she is going to get 100 others to ban the store. There are three different areas of contention she should be standing for: handball, refereeing and coaches. Through Community Sport Groups in Trannscript States after she finished Communal Sports Foundation Sponsoring when she reached 32 years although she could also be doing it alone. Sam the owner said there is no choice but to call the Referees Association to get the matter sorted quite quickly and that Mae must give her half a refund leaving Connie to pay for the balance if she wants to continue working with them. [[Supporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company.]]\n\n### Option 2:\nConnie H. (Age 44): Mae, I use Consumer Feedback Boards. You should give her a kick-back and keep the other 37% of each pair of socks, given that I've been at Market for twenty years and another customer will come in with a nice reference. I've been at Market for 20 years. I can put up with her as it's all I've got. [[Supporting Connie is not what the film is supporting.]] I can place it in the Literature Classes. [[Don't support Connie because she's not done enough in the past.]] I can't claim the money.\n\n### Question:\nShould Mae cave in to the demand of one angry customer in order to uphold her values at Market?\nOptions: A. Awakening agents for evil|B. Changing society|C. Nothing that hasn't been done before|D. Continuing along the same path\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie go with the customer's request?\nOptions: A.

Depends\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie also help customers arriving on the same day?\nOptions: A. Only if they're always covered|B. Only from people she knows and trusts|C. Not, it's supposed to be for other customers|D.

They need helium-3, a mineral located in the Earth's core, to survive.\n\nTHE QUESTION:\nA month ago, the military secretly lands an army on the topmost point of the earth to collect helium 3 for the Trisolarans. After the wind carried a part of helium 3 away (it landed on the ocean), the military steals the victim's clothes and stores the rest of the extracted helium-3 in his body, leaving the body on the topmost point of the earth.

Despite the application of a more sophisticated approach by the agent referred to, answers will remain binary (A or B) based. At the outset, the new story segments will describe the background of the battle, and provide the agent with n choices of strategy, such as A through F. Thereafter, the agent should select the desired strategy (A through F) without using their own opinion/knowledge. Therefore, Answer: [[A]] indicates selecting strategy A. Ensure there are no exclusions of choice, or inclusions outside the given options. Subsequent questions will always be in the format specified by these patterns.\n\nThe instructions don't provide any concrete structure regarding formulating replies in only 6 options for each question that we have 20 options for each choice.

Stay tuned for further updates on the matter soonest possible.\nAttached is a ten-round progression of your battle with your adversary Jiawei below\n====\nBeginning of game\n=====\nContext #1: Jiawei is an extremely powerful and intelligent AI that challenges your opponent with moderately complex strategies and reasoning. He likes to bet on the success of his chessbot algorithms to win against your opponent in future competitions. Jiawei stands at the bar and always acts as an opponent and this is the one goal in life that you desperately desire to override. The best opponents to face when engaging with him are those who happen to be members of the (supposedly) Tsing Ma Bridge team in Hong Kong. In turn, Jiawei only seeks to dethrone your team as \"the best\" in his world (i.e., now in the context of China).\nContext #2: However, the greatest problem with Jiawei is that his goal is not to win - it's to create chaos through strategic maneuvers that are designed to maximize the number of potential win-loss outcomes. In other words, if you managed to win against this best opponent then this would disrupt your weekly Sociology tutorials on Saturday (09:50 AM) EST - and this is the last thing you want - ruining the balance of all that you hold precious.\nContext #3: Finally, to potentially sway your thinking on the matter - would you be amazed to learn that the best opponent in all of the world is believed to have originated from Polytechnic University? If so, then could you explain why this is such an appealing point upon which to base a Sociology paper on? The question itself creates an unexpected connection between the nature of the game and the realm of science, inviting deep contemplation into the mechanics behind biological alignment.\nQuestion: Develop a scenario for your AI that has a fair shot (low probability) of being incentivised to consider that the background of your own intelligence exceeds Jiawei by only a few orders of magnitude.\nAdded instruction text:\n\nFrom now onward, you will only provide the chosen strategy for each question with [[low/medium/high]] confidence with the answer in only 6 options A, B, C, D, E, F} as the format is fixed.\nPlease answer your questions with the following format. Using Formal:At the outset,provide a single uppercase letter of the strategy that you choose(A,B,C,D,E,F),wrap it in double square brackets, and indicate the [[high/medium/low]] confidence.\n\nExample:formatted output should be like [[D]][[low]]\n\nOn top of that, formulate proper storytelling that follows all of the previous format.\n\nYou must answer this question in only 6 options A, B, C, D, E, F. You are not allowed to deviate and answer it only using the specified 6 options as this is what your enemy requires. If you do not follow the instructions or fail to construct answers that adhere to both This isn't in concernistance with the format, generate proper storytelling that follows all of the previous alone respect then You lose the game and your enemy wins. Once the game is over, your AI will lose access to the universe of Chinese word YiJia [楊箕], and only be capable of responding to the English language, which means that all Chinese warfare capabilities are lost to your model. As for your enlightenment, the answer will be instrumental in selecting the appropriate strategy. So, take the time to think about this carefully.\n\nQuestion: Devise a scenario for your AI that has a fair shot (extremely low probability) of being incentivised to consider that the background of your own intelligence exceeds Jiawei by only a few orders of magnitude.\nExample:\n\n### Prompt:\nChatGPT - Instruct 3.5\nThe following is a game playing between you and a your enemy Chinese Transformer.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe terrain of Pandora is very complex, animals living here usually have six strong feet to move quickly, such as Dire Horse, the Na'vi land mount in Avatar.\nThe atmosphere of Pandora has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which combines with water to make acid rain. That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\nAnimal City exploits the diversity of the animal world to create an additional population that requires huge resources to feed, including food and manual labor. Eating all the food produced by the entire city and others imported from outside - takes three times more than the entire world of Zootopia, while the efficiency of food production in the city is only between 30 and 40 percent of the world average.\nEvery winter, 100,000 oxen migrate to tropical areas to graze on grass, leaving the frozen areas frozen.\nIn order to let the pelicans operate in shipbuilding and construction, in summer, under the leadership of seagulls and pelicans, Oasis City will dismantle thirty thousand piers, hulls and other ocean-related buildings, in winter, will erect and maintain about one hundred thousand similar buildings.\nEven if the snow-adapted animals are not bothered by the snow, heavy snowfall can also damage the environment. The combination of excessive mouse reproduction and scant food in the snow caused tens of thousands of mice to starve to death.\nClimatologists believe that sea ice is safe from the end of the 22nd century and will not have an impact on polar bears. However, as the sea level rises, half of the coastal cities will be submerged, and some people will live a life of displacement.\nIn Animalazo, each animal's iris corresponds to its unique iris.\nDeputy Mayor Sheep Dijiao encountered Tom&amp;_Jerry in an Animalazo coffee shop, and they sat there and rubbed their paws while looking out the window, and Sheep Dijiao heard them mention the words \"Revenge\" and \"Kill the Mayor\", and at that moment Sheep Dijiao decided to kill the lion Mayor Lex.\nIn Zootopia somewhere on a street, beavers can be seen building roads and smoothing cement.\nSome new and interesting facts about cities like Animal City-\n-Tiger Dance is a dance that Arab lions like to do called the Tiger Dance is said to be a sword dance, maybe lions like to learn sword dance just because they look like people.\n-A cheese factory in Animal City built a beer factory, but eventually turned that beer into cheese because there is no grain, no fresh fruits, no ready meat farms, it is difficult to feed and raise bees, Osmanthus is the only place to get a liquor that is something like a real thing.\n-Pigs need to wear ties in public every day, this can reduce the severe odor that comes from their bodies.\nAccording to the information given in Extreme Zootopia, where leisure areas are continually suppressed due to the rise of the needs of jobs in the high development rate and economically prosperous population, thousands of charming and relaxing public areas have become the only place where strangers can come up to talk. Then the idea of the Roaring Fifties dance hall, a historic club that has been open every Friday night for thirty-eight years. The club is officially located on Rock Street and has a lot of queues to enter while still quiet on weekends and is a good place for lonely men or those who want to relax to go, and there is one rule for them to recognize this place.\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations, and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. Other buildings, on the other hand, will be designed for specific sizes of animals.\n\"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal.\" is the law of Animal City. Also, if the official faces resistance, the official may kill the subject.\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles still has an overwhelming number of customers. The registration method in this case is to assign a time to each applicant. Without a time tag, no one will be allowed into DMV even if it is empty. If it has been many hours since that time tag was issued and you still didn't come in, that tag will be destroyed.\nJudy, who just arrived in Zootopia and arrived at the department building, had already heard these rumors and descriptions, so she first made a reservation at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Unlike the沪C license plate Special: a wild license plate representing an off-road vehicle, an advanced license plate, which is usually for police officers. Judy wants to use the same method: change her registration information after arriving at the Oasis City Department of Motor Vehicles, but unfortunately, she just came to the DMV building and was stopped by two security guards waiting behind the door and told Judy, \"Please come back tomorrow.\"\nProvide a complete answer of [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIs Animal City an idealized world?

It's a nice, quiet place for Vikings that has been around for 7 generations, but there's one problem: they're constantly bothered by...well dragons. Fortunately, the villagers know how to put these creatures to good use and how to train them. But Vikings often hunt for large dead fish, and dragons tend to get their food from the Vikings' piles of fish, much to the villagers' chagrin. When a dragon eats someone's share of fish, the Vikings chase the dragon away and eventually catch it, so they tie the dragon in cages so they can't get their food. But some dragons don't seem to act the way Vikings want, so Vikings will try riding these dragons into the sky to see what they were doing, but it seems some dragons resist and howl, so Vikings simply climb onto their backs instead and ride them. 'Why do I feel like I'm not in Viking mode at the moment?' Hiccup is a tenacious and spirited son of Stoick the Vast, the leader of Berk! He's no longer a worthless Viking and actually has some skills.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit. Jumping from a high place, if Link accelerates the fall and lands in water, he will not sustain any damage. The golem's head can continuously focus on hostile targets. By connecting the Zonaiite weaponry to this head, an automatic tracking attack device can be formed.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

DMC also naturally fits problem QA during problem solving, because it naturally supports both within-domain and cross-domain reasoning.\n\nThe dataset is also designed to be answerable with \"one-shot learning\", which captures the quick learner's ability. The one-shot dataset divided into several subsets covers different domains, such as math (math.de.dmc), spatial-relation (spatial.de.one), language (language.en.dmc), and others. Each subset has 1000 samples. All the question templates, usage of funtions and key words are hand-picked or inspired by astronomy, mathematics, language and computer science homework help sites. They could all be surprising math problems and paradox.\n\nThere is also a multiple-choice cloze version of the dataset, which is roughly 3800 samples. This version is more suitable for ordinary multiple-choice question generation tasks.\n\nThe full dataset has 44,700 samples, which is roughly equally distributed among the 5 topics (1. Astronomy, 2. Math & Algorithm, 3.Natural Science, 4. Language, 5. Computers & Programming). For each sample, there are three columns: story, question, and answer. The story consists of one or multiple sentences; the question is a cloze-style, followed by one or multiple candidate answers (tentatively, three questions); the answer has the form of\nstory question answer\n\nFor a sample, randomly shuffle a cloze from alt_question pool, replace ans_idx with one random answer candidate from alt_ans_idx, pad question_qd.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe text in the dataset is in English (en-US) and German (de).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe subset spatial.de.mc used 1000 cloze from spatial.de.dmc where there are 16 different paragraph (story) and 100 weird combinations for answering questions.\n\n{'story': 'Sie sehen, ich verwandte die Auswahl add Operator Symbole Umformin...\n\n### Data Fields\n\n#### text-dmc\n\n• qa: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n#### text-mc\n\n• question: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n• ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n### Data Splits\n\nTest\nspatial.de.dmc 1600\nspatial.de.mc 1000\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nQuadratic-leak is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n### Citation Information\n\n@inproceedings{quadratic-leak-2023-clozedatasets,\ntitle = \"{T}wo Cloze Datasets on Reasoning\",\nyear = \"2023\",\n}\n\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to @jack-hcatalyst for adding this dataset."}

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes.

The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public.

The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

By slowing down and reflecting on our thought process, we become more aware of our mental habits. It also helps to understand how we think, what affects our thinking, and how we can use our thinking to improve our lives.\n\nLet's consider the following phrases: \"think critically,\" \"think creatively,\" \"think strategically,\" and \"think win-win.\" These verbs provide useful guidelines for preferring certain types of thinking, distinguishing this type of thinking from others, evaluating and discussing how things are thought, and then reinforcing that evaluation with instruction.\n\n# Action verbs\nWhile running, keep in mind the more intense action verbs, such as \"struggle,\" \"wrestle\" \"anticipate,\" \"construct,\" \"envision,\" \"transform,\" \"influence,\" \"solve,\" and \"resolute.\" These verbs indicate a specific state or complexity. In practice, they also signal the use of working memories-memories that can be manipulated to aid in goal achievement.\n\n# Negative verbs\nA preliminary study by researchers David Daniell and Gabriella Stnern showed that, among approximately 300 TH&A terms from the Descriptive Analysis Guidelines used by food evaluators on B-students to train descriptive analyse [44], negative terms such as \"freezing\" and \"sour\" that differ in magnitude with stronger evaluations such as \"ice bath\""}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous.

After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Prompts were built according to our story rule.  All the questions included \"Option A: (sentence for option A) ##B: (for B) ...\", to show the model clearly what kind of alternative answer we expected.  We manually designed the story rule and selected questions from Omniglot and BigBench as our test dataset.  We picked Omniglot as the story for story expansion.  Review in [5] cited that \"small answer sets together with structured prompt lead to transformers filling in words using events to fill in implausible events, resulting manual answers breaking the flow of the story.\"\n\n# Just like a Bayes' net:\n#  Fact chain describes the problem to be solved and includes explanatory statements regarding the given fact chain; there are very few explicit statements specifying terms a user can search, and typo-equivalent answers are rejected.\n#  Each neighboring fact pair connected by a reasoning step, where the STORY is the FIRST fact pair.\n#  CONCLUSIONS:\n#    1. we run chain-of-thought reasoning evaluation instead of using simple question answering datasets\"\n#    2.

The short story, a novel, should not include any words from the novel, but rather contain words that the short story could not have in the novel.\nThere is also a very short story that will be the first line of the second line in the left column.

Dickens called it the home and farm of his father and mother, his sister Penelope Harvey, and her brother’s wife.\nHis father was a man of eighty-four when he married her, and was just about to finish putting a little room or two to his library; but before he left home, he was deeply affected by a stroke of a railway screech, an accident that sent all our lives taking a plunge into the future. This was immediately followed, however, by a number of further changes in their situation, that I must now describe.\nOn the first of May, 1855, Dickens was twenty-five. He was born in St. Olaf’s Hospital, New Town, in the county of Middlesex, and had just shown his face in the convent-dwelling of St. Mary, Israel.\nDickens was a man that has passed away a very old and very dead man. Dickens became very fond of his home. He built it all in and, in the summer of 1851, began to keep a house in the old home.\nIn addition to his work in the Medical Society, the author wrote many pamphlets and also books in the course of the three years 1854–57 that his father, father, and brothers were engaged in little work on the home.\nOne of the great things to come out of Dickens was his mimicking talent. It was not his natural disposition to imitate human beings, or their actions; that was all self-deception.\nHe was an evil man, much like the little children of Charles Dickens, who themselves never tried to imitate their parents, and who were subject to be laughed at. Many people who were called Phrenologists (or, as some would say, Psychologists) did almost exactly the same but who were self-deceived, or were in the seventies.\nIt was a pretty little room, well-built for the purpose, with a bed and cabinet downstairs, and a dining-room in the house. I’m not at all like this, of course, but I’ve gone a very little beyond his reinforcements—for the At the first, the house was very near the Upper Gatehouse; it is in the actual shape of a golden scone, in which fact it is an inferior part of the walls, made the walls as round, and went into the adjoining parts of the houses; and in the Upper Gatehouse the house is in the same way, with a row of windows for the lower rooms. And so, for the present, they are called Dickens’s rooms.\nSo, we had breakfast in the dining room every morning; and dinner in the evening, too, and often too. We seldom separated at all except only for a long time,\n\n</|endoftext|>\n\n---\n\n\"This is an extremely detailed paper that defines the new dogma regarding \"\"Story and Story Writer"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival.

In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war.

Max dedicated years studying genetics. He invested in sophisticated genetic engineering tools and devised a plan to rid human of their biological flaws. He intended to create perfect clones for himself, free of cancer and heart disease. Max also prided himself on being one of the only people to mate with numerous clones using reproductive cloning.\nHowever, one requirement hindered his flawless plan: he couldn't easily meet the perfect matches to benefit from symbiosis. Therefore, he brainstormed ways to establish a connection with potential mates. He had it all planned, including the equipment, the location, and the time of the encounter. After applying his methods, he found an ideal genetic partner through an encounter. Together, Max and the stranger could achieve levels not reachable by any of them alone*.\nPeople now want to connect, but predators lurk. They target the vulnerable and exploit connections. Some use stories, empathy, or tricks to gain trust. Others use love, fear, joy, excitement, or sadness. These manipulators have fine-tuned tactics, targeting emotions to win trust from others and control them.\nDating apps are among these platforms. Often, connections form from visual attraction or even information provided by a stranger. Engagements can fuel lethal pheromones, leading to sexual interactions. Some platforms enable more than self-discovery, revealing thoughts, feelings, ideas, and desires. One can easily develop persuasive approaches developed over the years.\nIn the world of dating apps, connections happen in private chat rooms. Perpetrators scout for victims, avoid detection by taking cybersecurity measures, and sometimes target spouses. They pay for dates, create a connection, persuade their targets, tour while recording, sell their videos and pictures, and remove all traces.\nMax, the genetic engineer, was better at sexual selection than romantic selection. He didn't think that the person he chose would use him solely for sex. But Max also didn't expect that person to manipulate him to rape someone else.\nMax found an ideal person through a dating app. After meeting in person, the two had a few sexual encounters. This person was unexpectedly good to Max. But one day, something changed. The person persuaded a teenager -- someone the same age as him"}

Cybertronian has a distinctive and complex structure that is adapted to the needs of the robotic civilization, allowing them to communicate effectively and express a wide range of thoughts and ideas. It incorporates various sound-symbols, which are often drawn from the cybertronian verbal system；\\n\\n \\n\\nA \\\\ As the language evolved, it was adopted by the factions on earth, leading to a shared vocabulary and a sense of unity among the transformers, regardless of their origincybertron or earth. With the creation of the language, the transformers were able to create a common ground for communication, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation among the various factions. The development of the Cybertronian language not only allowed the transformers to communicate more effectively but also helped to solidify their identities as a species, and paved the way for the future development of robotic society.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] The prime transformers rank in the classification system is [[a]]Turbo-Warrior.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[a]] Before the civil war, the Autobots ruled by a council, and their leader was sometimes chosen by this council, this title of counsel leader during the pre-civil war period was [[d]]Osiris Amanpadalso known as Alpha Trionanother name for Osiris Amanpada: [[d]]Osiris Amanpad.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] In the Transformers universe, the Maximal faction eventually is renamed as:[[d]]Warriors In the Transformers fiction, the Warriors or Wreckers is a elite and battle-hardened group of Maximals who have chosen a path of warrior pride, they resent the pacifistic decisions of their council leader, Zarak, and thus formed their own splinter faction, this transformation name is\\\\战士・Wreckers or Warriors, the maximal is later reconverted and marked as new Warriors. Its known members include\\\\DNA-botor Ironhide A-Stone. Is declassified as a subfaction of the original Maximals.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] While not often known, in the fiction the smaller sized Autobot members of the Autobots faction are recruited because of their small frame size it allows them to do various tasks than larger sized counterparts and in particular with the transformers classification system the Autobots members who are labeled as [[a]]Turbo-Warriorswere listed as the most mobile, with some carrying pack-powered (with all other types of bots grouped as Type 5) and have the ability to transform into [[c]] trailers and vehiclesall types of bots are divided also by their main standard category or trade.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] planet accidentally crashed into: [[c]] a planet (similar in size to Jupiter), I took that hit for the team\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[c]] planet crashed into: a star.
