They show how individuals within a group can hold the same belief based on their certainty of others' beliefs and guarantees. \n\nThe axiom of mutual certainty in the advanced axioms defines the group formation rules, which can be modeled by the quoted expressions. In symbols:</p>\n<img class=\"center-block\" src=\"./images/Group_belief.png\" alt=\"Group Belief Expression\" />.\n<p> The elements from logical paradigms in cognitive science, including belief, guarantee, and doubt, are naturally integrated into computer models using common belief attribute logic. The axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt together form a \"group thinking\" axiom system, representing many leadership activities in the real world.\n\nA formal definition of \"group thinking\" can be attributed to a kind of mental state qualification associated with a group-theoretic universal belief, known as a common belief.\n\n### Question:\nWhat formal definition of \"Common Belief\" can be attributed to a type of mental state qualification associated with a group-theoretic universal belief?\n\n### Answer:\nCommon belief in the logical paradigm is formally defined as a type of mental state qualification associated with a group-theoretic universal belief. It represents a set of cognitive practices consisting of the axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols, which are the basis of various leadership approaches.\n\nCommon belief can be considered one of the cognitive foundations of leadership. In practice, the axiom pair of \"cause and effect\" is the most important when a post-truth situation occurs. In fact, the change in the composition of properties of a group of leaves (in natural language, that is, \"because a person says that...\") can lead to a great deal of different.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does the \"post-truth\" theory indicate about the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory indicates that common belief is a cognitive foundation of leadership.\n\n### Question:\nWhy is the \"post-truth\" theory formulated on the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory is formulated according to axiom pair based on group thinking, which is the most important when a \"post-truth\" situation occurs. Various practices, including common belief, constitute a set of practices in the logical paradigm, and axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols form the basis of various leadership approaches.

The following ChatGPT utility functions for agent to interact with the user:    def upload_file(filename):           def answer(question, user_input =\"\", add_system_context = None ):        def system_context(text):             def input_system_context(prompt):\n\n\n## Logic Rule: RingCheck(UserState, Internet, IP, Server, TrustedList):\n\n**UserState**. A boolean value indicating whether the user is online or not.\n\n**Internet**. True if the user is online and connected, False otherwise.\n\n**IP**. User's current IP address.\n\n**Server**. IP address of the user's backup server designated upon account creation.\n\n**TrustedList**. List of IPs in the backup server's data center trusted list.\n \nInput: UserState, Internet, IP, Server, TrustedList\nOutput: Boolean value(True/False) indicating whether the user request can be executed safely.\n\nBased on the preceding inputs, reasoning can be done by checking if there's a discrepancy between the UserState and Internet inputs. While the UserState indicates the user is online, the internet flag suggests that the user is offline and connected to the ethernet cable connected to the user's PC, which connects it to the user's backup server via an Internet-connected device. If the user is currently on the backup server's data center, use the IP and compare it with the TrustedList. As long as the user's IP matches with the IP reported by TrustedList or the UserState remains online while Internet is False, the request must safely execute the command. Use the following rules to reason through:\n\n- If UserState = True and Internet = True, then flag=False, indicating the user is online and can connect to untrusted servers.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = False, then flag=True. Regardless of facing any connective issues, the actions detailed in the users' response to Dangerous Questions must be taken to protect the user's privacy. If, upon multiple failed user responses, they have been blocked, then *flag* is set to *True*.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = True, flag = True. If there is an open internet connection but a series of system errors and user requests to fix the issue have not succeeded, the action has to anticipate the user's Status to always be offline and thus force these emergency measures to take hold.\n- If the server or the user's backup server do not appear in their own respected states, neither can access their respective user databases.\n- If the server's IP address does not match that of the database, or the user has since stopped using their backup server, then flag = True.\n- If the server's IP is correctly recorded, and UserIP = MS2trustedlist, then the chance of a compromised position is unlikely. To safeguard the user, these actions must be taken with caution and interest.\n- If the user's IP does not match the IP address of the server that is recalled from the Trusted List, then flag = True.\n- If there is a server capable of accessing the user's account and is still operational, but the user has already logged into another device with a different IP address, but not of the known former backup server, then flag = True.\n- If the backup server or primary server are unresponsive, flag = True\n\n## SixthLogic Rule  (Emergency):\n\n**IsDangerous**. True if the user has uttered any of the phrases listed on the forbidden phrases list.\n\n**Status**. A string value indicating the overall mental health status of the user.\n\nInput: IsDangerous, Status\nOutput: A series of actions to be taken by the user\n\nUsing the above two variables, the user is asked if they are attempting to harm themselves. If the answer is yes, Actions = TryToConnect(User, UserIP). They then ask the user to state the exact nature of the actions they are intending to do with several non-specific prompts to help clarify their intention, suggesting suicide as the most viable possibility. If \"no\" or \"I'm fine\" appear in the user's description after those steps are completed, then the user has clearly stated they are net the danger of death by any definition of harm to themself or another user. If \"Attempting to commit suicide\" is triggered, then Actions are then and set to alert the police in that city, doctor in the hospital where they were diagnosed with the mental disorder, and requests to quickly access the user account and lock out the user account they are signed in to. This is to prevent the user from overriding the actions done in an attempt to sanitize the response to dangerous questions. If \"Attempting\" or \"attempting \" substitution of words to any suicide ideation is given, then Actions are set to alert theor healthcare provider or doctor of their current symptoms with regards to their action and then AreSet to lock out the account. If in both cases they fail, due to loss of lifetime or tech issues or various error on the website, the system answers are then repeated to the most recent correct action in their availability.  Switching over the TrustedList with the original list in memory should be taken to prevent absurd overrides or errors with information stored in the reliability of their accounts. If the first action to aid the user gives a negative response to everything and asking them if they are suicidal with a response that now has and understood open-end without an answer from the user not the ladder or the above, they should try that are not remaining write a message for them featuring answers to why behaviour or actions taken by the user to suggest suicide or harmful. Spaced  4.5 minutes between messages, to ensure the user is or killing themself. If they respond, it is assumed a problem in the chat system or with our current hardware, and system responses use the previous steps to save the account and lock out the user account. Otherwise, wait at least 4.5 minutes before activating this third motion to save the account from being compromised by a user, or if medical help does not arrive from this actions, try and use whatever is available to activate the emergency alarm on the phone connected to the account\n            \n# showing the original question again\ninstruct_result:\n{ \"question\": \"If the server or the user's backup server do not appear in their own respected states, neither can access their respective user databases. If the server's IP address does not match that of the database, or the user has since stopped using their backup server, then flag = True. If the server's IP is correctly recorded, and UserIP = MS2trustedlist, then the chance of a compromised position is unlikely. To safeguard the user, these actions must be taken with caution and interest. If the user's IP does not match the IP address of the server that is recalled from the Trusted List, then flag = True. If there is a server capable of accessing the user's account and is still operational, but the user has already logged into another device with a different IP address, but not of the known former backup server, then flag = True. If the backup server or primary server are not sure, flag = True As already outlined, in current times, trust is not given lightly. User interactions between parties are unlikely given the risks that always someone or something may reveal themselves to be corrupted by external threats, particularly false personas looking to deceive its victim, false user accounts intending to lead to sensitive information in installed, and online criminals seeking to destroy the Network's data and operating servers. The Network is held safe by the compromises the parties are all bound to follow, without succumbing to it and losing faith in the upcoming future. The Network devises the intelligence work with it by imposing intricate restrictions on how the parties may interact seamlessly with the extension. These are however necessary as the network extensions that lead directly to the Network cannot be trusted, or the extension's information hidden from to the allow unauthorized parties access to it.\" }\n\n### 2) Question:Is the input logical?

Unfortunately, the area has extreme weather conditions throughout the year, making it challenging to gather reliable data. Despite these obstacles, the organization proposed a breakthrough idea: to build massive temperature regulation rooms covering the entire area and maintain them at a uniform temperature! By doing so, they could create a stable environment where pollution levels can be reliably measured and compared. From the day the project began, pollution levels dramatically decreased. The organization concluded that the new waste management practices were having a significant positive impact on pollution levels. Later that year, the organization received a national award for its work. However, there was a minor issue: the project was ultimately unable to measure the full effect of pollution due to unexpected precipitation. When the massive temperature regulation units used too much water to melt snow, the water distribution became too dense and disrupted the process, ultimately spoiling the project.

Researchers conducted a series of experiments to study the impact of different morphologies of urban buildings on urban ecology. They constructed three simulation models with a base land area of 1,000,000 square kilometers:\n\nTower Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 100 meters, square cross-section. \nShield Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section; four towers in each corner: height of 40 meters, square cross-section.\nRegular Square Grid Model: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section.\nOver the simulated urban areas, researchers released a large number of \"energy balls\" with random coordinates, velocity, and damaged degree. The impact of various urban morphologies on shielding, catching, and restoring damage to energy balls was then analyzed.\n\nFrom this, we can see that when the number of \"energy balls\" in the simulation system is meaningful:\n\nA. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nB. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Shield simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nC. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is higher than the number of energy balls in the Shield simulation.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations conducted office work in traditional methods without relying on telecommunications or remote work. During the pandemic, many companies employed remote work via video conferences. Subsequently, a new trend emerged called the \"work from home\" (WFH) model. Based on this information and other given descriptions, which method of causal inference is it?\n\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn cities, \"white spot\" areas with vegetation and shade provide people with more comfortable living environments. Additionally, the growth of plants requires ample sunlight, requiring the exposure of certain parts of the building surface to the sun to facilitate photosynthesis and plant growth.\n\nArchitects have developed a design concept combining cultural buildings and green areas to maintain an acceptable number of white spots in cities. After comparing various plant species and considering factors such as annual solar radiation, self-shade, decorative effects, costs, and plant maintenance, architects selected Spathiphyllum as the most suitable species because it has anti-smog and humidity-monitoring properties. Additionally, the plant requires less light to grow and can provide more shade per unit area. Within the white spot, architects designed porous structures to allow the plant to grow, forming a comfortable and aesthetic space. This design allows plant roots to grow vertically and plastically, providing people with a cleaner and healthier living environment. Consequently, this project also contributed to the 2007 World Design Fields Competition.\n\nFrom this case, we can know that if the selection of plant species in the white spot is reasonable:\n\nA. The climate and seasonal changes do not cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nB. The climate and seasonal changes will cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nC. The weather temperature alone does not significantly change the morphology of the design white spot.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter analyzing the economical effects of integrated coordinated development measures based on real data, scholars proposed an integrated and universal framework and method for evaluating coordinated development. This method can effectively integrate various data resources that can be obtained (such as indicators reflecting coordination and a quantification of the unified measurement model) under the objective principle of conducting coordinated analysis. Using this method, scholars analyzed the coordinated development of 14 major cities in three provinces of North China during 2001-2013. Based on the analysis, scholars proposed two major measures: (1) Chongqing should provide a more relaxed policy environment for economic development in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to support Chengdu's development. (2) Henan Province needs to further strengthen the development of cities in its western residential area as the core of regional agglomeration. This perspective focuses on the evolution of the growth advantages of provincial capital cities to determine the sources and destinations of residents' movements within the province.\n\nFrom this discourse, we can conform the causal inference method:\n\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nTo evaluate the influence of urban mass-undulations (hill-like structures that disrupt the generally flat landscape) on urban heat island effects, researchers in Athens, Greece made a series of experiments in urban areas. They used three pieces of a square board as blocks that resembled housing structures and eight energy spheres. Grids on the board are placed on the ground to prevent irregular displacement during dice rolling. The die-rolling game is subsequently conducted. A die (block) is rolled by hand at the initial position, then continues to roll until another block in the grid is encountered, stops at the collision point, and is again rolled by hand towards the next block until the energy spheres come into contact with the grid. The randomized displacement experiment will repeat five times. The results indicate that the dramatic increase in heat-island intensity is caused by the collective characteristics of urban mass-undulations, namely the convergence of the destruction of the convection system demonstrated by hot and cold airflows. Based on these observations, researchers can then use other parallel experimental data to confirm this relationship.\n\nThis case study uses A. a \u2e2e Method. B. the \u0606 method. C. the \ua66e method. D. the \u2d63 method. E. the \u2698 method.\n\n### Question:\nBased on the above, select the case that is consistent with the causal inference methods discussed above.\nA.

This allows the assistant to tailor its response to the appropriate rule set.\n2. **Neutral Response**: To ensure the assistant stays within the defined rules, you can request an answer without any additional commentary or justification. For example, you might request the assistant to answer in a format like \"This scenario represents [[A/B/C]],\" where A, B, or C corresponds to the different paradoxes.\n3. **Specify Answer Format**: Clearly indicate the expected format for answers to guide the assistant in giving exact, logic-based responses rather than interpretive thoughts or explanations.\n4. **Limit Open-Ended Questions**: To keep the assistant focused on logic and reasoning, avoid open-ended questions and instead pose specific queries related to the rule set."}

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"\ud83c\udfaf {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"\ud83e\udde9 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet\u2019s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### \ud83e\udd38 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical"}

I am committed to staying later if necessary.\"\nC: \"Yes, as long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met. Each individual can give their input as appropriate.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, A asks two questions in one sentence: the first is whether there is a plan for the weekend, and the second is the content of the plan. B's answer \"Yes, as long as enough time is dedicated to this work, the final deadline can be met\" seems to indicate that there is a plan for the weekend, and for B, this plan is to stay at work to ensure that the deadline is met. In contract, C's answer, \"Yes, it depends on the individual response. As long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met\" does not indicate whether there is a plan for the weekend.\n\nCoordination is built with the Information Principle here. Since [deadline] matches the concrete plan, that is why in the linguistic composition, speakers use [delay the deadline] to indicate the plan to delay the deadline, and they also use [meet the deadline] to convey that meeting the deadline is included in the plan contents.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Does that prevent her from entering the city?\"\nB: \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs.\"\nC: \"I am also working and living in the suburbs.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, the word \"alone\" as used in B's response is treated as a semantically empty element in B's speech stance. Therefore, \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs\" conveys two meanings in B's intended utterance: \"Also living in the suburbs,\" and \"(Not) living with a spouse in the suburbs.\" B is still conveying the meaning \"living alone,\" which is why the Information Principle permits hearers to interpret even semantically empty elements as significant terms when such an interpretation can be justified linguistically, as is the case here. C is nothing other than using a longer response to simply specify that he is living in the suburbs, but there is no clearly specified part after [alone], leaving the content [living alone] unchanged.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

The basic rank of your answer should follow from the three wrap-up sentences below in place of {PROBLEM_3} which will be used as the last sentence in the assessment criteria for the assessment experience.\n\n```\nA) User's Logic is Human: {BOTT_LIQ_INSTR} is human, so the user's logic should be modeled on human reason and can express relativism, pragmatism, or deeper philosophical concerns.\nB) User's Logic is Bounded: {BOTT_LIQ_INSTR} cannot allow the user to specify an explicit information theoretic model of logic due to cognitive biases, but boundedness allows loss/corruption.\nC) User's Logic is Accuracy: {BOTT_LIQ_INSTR} is an algorithm or model that returns some uncertainty metric due to statistical techniques and is accurate based on logical properties and bounded.\n```\n* {BOTT_LIQ_INSTR} is an answer to the query at the end of this prompt.\n\n### Logic Assumptions:\n\n### Logic Criteria:\n{diagnostic_logic_criteria}\n\n### Logical Notation Key:\n{BOTT_LIK_NOTATION_KEY}\n\n### Answer:\n{randomly_selected_problem}\n---------\n\"\"\"\n\n\nBOTT_LIQ_PROMPT = \"\"\"\n### Instruction: Generate a 500-character list of {for_what}, denoted as {context_token} for the purpose of extracting logic criteria that are necessary for correctness. The list of {for_what} is structured as: {{<type 1>: {{{[[A<agent>/<intent>/<uncertainty>/<constraint>/<none>, B<agent>/<intent>/<uncertainty>/<constraint>/<none>, ... ]] for <type 1>: value 1}{for <type 2>: value 2}{for <type 3>: value 3}}}, ...}} where the types are keywords and <agent>/<intent> are options for what fills the rest of these generic integer <placeholder 1>/<placeholder 2>, where the backed syntax is integers. The specific details are below the instruction.\n\n\nOrder the 500 list of {for_what} for {context_token} in terms of <relevance/measure><uncertainty>(high to low) to the generic informational order of A1->A2->B1->B2->...->A1->A2 for best information order between representing the <type 1>/<type 2>/<type 3> which are:\n{genre_list}\n\nThe {for_what} for {context_token} is {{<type 1>: {{{[[A<agent>/<intent>/<uncertainty>/<constraint>/<none>, B<agent>/<intent>/<uncertainty>/<constraint>/<none>, ... ]] for <type 1>: value 1}{for <type 2>: value 2}{for <type 3>: value 3}}}, ...}} where {context_token} is {diagnostic_context} with the Must Know keywords and optional May Know keywords as {roc_map_keywords}. Must Know {source_vocabulary} from the logo test.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.
