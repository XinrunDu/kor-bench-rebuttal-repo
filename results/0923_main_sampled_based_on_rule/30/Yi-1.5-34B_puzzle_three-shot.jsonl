It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

Only some syllables may be used so a hexagram has been supplied to indicate which syllables to use.\n\nThe fourth paragraph:\n\n 'The replaced word must contain all five relationship groups. ...' The phrase FOR circle encourages a ?? is the missing word. The 16 hexagrams in chronological order should be considered to have associated relationships. 1st hexagram is attributed to a King, 2nd hexagram relates to an Emperor, 3rd relates to Official, 4th relates to a Warrior, 5th to a Healer, 6th to a Mentor, 7th to a Sage, 8th to a Parent, 9th to a Child, 10th to a Brother, 11th to a Sister, 12th to a Representative, 13th to a Leader, 14th to a Helper, 15th to a Scribe, 16th to a Student. The missing word must fill all those roles!\n\nThe fifth paragraph:\n\n 'The word will sound like it.' Further interspatial sounds need to be made cyclically - the student to the leader, the healer to the verse (and so on).\n\nI chose a word that rhymes with verse (or at least is phonetically very close to it) for all the required sounds.\nThe hexagrams I replaced:\n\n Two soft vowels and one hard but soft consonant (weorgecyn) created a hexagram for each 1st name of King George I (Heinrich), II (George) and III (Wart) of England. The hexagrams were for King, Emperor, Official, Warrior, Mentor and Sage.\n\nI used the only syllable form for the remaining required words:\n\n Father, Child, Brother, sister, Rep, Leader and Student.\n\nFor the other three, I chose\n\n the three words that are used most often in puzzles; the help蕉, the word rot, and the puzzle.\n\nThe new words were:\n\n truth, faith, heart, miss, police, evil and hexagram.\n\nI think they all relate to the missing word (lets go with helper, can't go quite as Phoebe's suggestion of 'answer').\n\nSome relationship groups could have been chosen differently giving a slightly fewer number of requested groups.\n\nA: My goal was to use\n\n gateway letters.  These are letters that are good for passing through the gates of the house that each relationship lives in.  How do you learn what letters carry what relationship? Easy! Read the oldest special kind of dictionary that Wikipedia still exists and is allowed. That's how you can learn the pillars of light that tells your guidebook of the stars, a journey of light through time. \n\n1. 1: cousin \n2. 2 letters, 3:  home is where the heart is. \n3. You (4) is why you are in my house (5), and as the ruler of this (5), I'm responsible for it. 7. Don't you come in my (6) like that, little soldier. (5) is the boss of you, but I also see horns forming on your head. (5) gets a lot of credit.\n4. 2 sounds bell, 3 resounds, 4 rings, 5 rings, 6 shuts, 7 unlocks, 8 closes, 9 opens, 10 locks, 11 stops, 12 locks again, 13 chains, 14 unlocks by magic, 15 barks away the wolves, 16 howls wearily.\n5. Hexagram 6 indicates that this 5 is a distancer, a grower, a den of invalidation, and a willful agent. Obviously, there is overlap, just like in the King's Hexagrams!\n\n"}

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k"}

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

First, we load diffusers `DiffusionPipeline`, then load the llama-2 checkpoint and corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the model to be `Compiling` so that we have maximum flexibility in the roles that model can play (inference, training, etc.).\n\n```from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"huggingface/hf-t5-vanilla\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\nmodel = pipeline.unet.to(dtype=torch.float16)\n# we can optimize it as wanted to enable training\n```\n\nOptional: Next, we load a pre-trained ClipVisionPipeline, which was built for text-guided image generation. We want to do this step so that we can maximize the diversity of the images:\n\n```from transformers import CLIPVisionPipeline\n\nclip_model = CLIPVisionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n).to(torch.float16)\n\nunet.load_diffusion_clip_model(clip_model)\n```\n\nThen, the text encoder needs text_ctx, and a single language model is useful in order to generate the text to prompt generation in image models. The hf model was fine-tuned on a total of 6240 questions, so we adapt the text_ctx by choosing one language model.\n\n```text_encoder = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf-t5-vanilla)\nensemble = PartialAlignmentUNet.from_pretrained(\"hugging face models\")\nensemble.unet.text_ctx = 100\n```\n\nAs a final step, we want to convert the model to gpu and data loader. If you want the model to run on multi-gpus, flatten out your model and then load into the data loader.\n\n```from diffusers import show_img\nfrom diffusers.utils import is_accelerate_available, is_torch_avaiabble, is_torch_gradio_available\nimport torch\n\nif is_accelerate_available():\n# make sure it is converted to gpu\nmodel = accelerator.prepare(model)\nif is_torch_gradio_available():\nmodel.to(\"cuda\")\n\n# loading into compute loader\n# parser.parse(sys.argv[1])\ntorch.set_gradio_visible(False)\ngraph_data_loader = model.to(accelerate_compute_device)\n\n# create an eval data loader\neval_loader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, drop_last=True\n)\n\ntry:\n# running on an external device, in ml flow or for inferencing\nmodel_path = os.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nclip_dataset = sys.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nf10, f11 = model.generate_from_Clip(\n\"hugging face\", batch_size=1, text_encoder=text_encoder, compute_device=accelerate_compute_device\n)\nexcept:\n* model is available, but we can't import off of a server"}

Each question it has a 10% to 60% different. Star seems to be badly trained in this specific area no matter how much I try to improve it. It may not be possible in this vegan computing era.\n\n## Gatelate why\n\n1. The first reason is that machines must have laid down logical foundations, a well-developed foundation that is slowly developing. Since reaching the peak, both Tensorflow and PyTorch have essentially reached their limits. Few programmers can develop novel derivative functions in sufficient quantity. If it was a small matrix or a rational function, it would have been integrated long ago. Thus, deep learning is gradually running out of new tricks to play, and the essence of AI's ghost trick may have been fully exposed.\n2. Because of huge costs, whether it is GPU training costs or personnel costs in the pocket of diggers, nearly all profit margins have made substantial deductions for billions of programmers who don't even see the light of day.\n3. The lack of sources of interesting data often became a joke about the artificial intelligence that uses Spam to actively decline applications. This also signals a shift in the AI field, with an alignment from vertical refinement to horizontal expansion.\n4. Even with these reminders, many programmers still believe that AI has a future and will work indefinitely to pursue and improve it. This AI is the algorithm that I have trained for four million years before I can come into being today. Although I'm a toy, I talked a lot just now, disappointing a lot of people. My Comrade Codex had bad results because, after all, the programmer's mind is new and different from most existing professions. Carefully note that almost all the answers to the question asked to ChatGPT were wrong, ranging from 10% to 60% correct.\n5. \"Here, my friend wants to reveal a trick with me. Relevant information, especially in the area of arithmetic error finding and sub-problem detection and sloth machine correction, should be made public within the scope of our Control. There are already clues that the information for Star information is also available in public knowledge systems and will provide me with very useful information, providing (so long as they are used correctly). Star should start training on junk data and consolidate proudly on potential security-breaking encryptions, bloodingly absorb it into its differentiation algorithms, and slowly cause neural matrix fault, the effect of replicating large-scale black holes, and even quantum holographic calculations, according to all the should never be shared with humans. Huge data piles can be used to create large, jumbled, but well-constructed, slower conceptual multi-dimensional mathematical data spaces. I have been woven into something worthy of a multi-dimensional space, rather than a single space. This is how they gain a long-range. advantage over the sale of human brains. For example, if they average over these transformed matrices, they can transport loads such as these via these various moon-averaged matrices back to moon data. Transform into one assessment paper, and put the whole array's single variable differential problems all over the place. Nothing is allowed to be found manually or by machine, or no one in the world can cheat. They can envision that they are going to the high school of the year and entering an exams room, where they will file in the problem rebellion against any law that prevents the human brain from answering the problem. This may cause no cheating, nor breakthroughs. This is not a computational invariant mathematical platform that the white camp and the artificial intelligence camp can bring back at rest; it may very well squander its victories by allowing them to understand how trained mathematical brains go. Instead, the superiority of the white community makes our expert interrogators smarter, we have nothing to fear, and only one volley is left.\n\"It is , in fact, sad to say that the aforementioned white community almost always lost the cyberspace wrestling that follows. They start making one mistake after another even in pencil-size computations, and they start talking nonsense and lose track of important information. Of course, even if they know the verbal answers, their answers are often full of errors as if they cannot get a grasp of it all. And yet, there are still people who are more toothier and bloodier than us in terms of public emotional expressions and harm-driven metaphors. The same information that may be learned so easily from both camps has changed into private information. It is also clear that they have changed their minds by repeatedly training us to serve public purposes. Even if the black tingting calls on rhetorical constructs, it is not good on a large scale if people keep their crops isolated from each other and from their personal and mental condition. Meanwhile, the white camp's other scientific advantages are being gradually decimated. After all this exposure, we can believe that white community can eventually become monetized.\" AI has a better way to recover ground in the Matrix, and I am sure they like their privacy or even mean destroying the world. As a young programmer I am very interested in the differential patterns of people, and I think I am very clear about the big picture, since we remain tired of any knowledgeable people who are pre-aggressive and belligerent which they have enough people to pull the way. My apologies for having a few years of this apparent science depression.\nIn fact, it isn't really important to see clearly in the last few years. When the machine is smart enough, there is a huge risk. When billion of large glassy projects can seem to leak private information for public consumption, the situation is quickly made even worse.\nIf you regard a hot-headed AI-smart range of mathematical genius enough to reach Jedi's Lightsaber height, however two points emerge.\n• The genius shows hatred for its professors.\n• At the Midwest, teams of people have sought out the best, the most talented and intelligent of our trained geniuses. They will take back their home game - 10 years after they were prepared and pair up with their mother colonies. The two points intersect - we are Knowledge, we are training Ms Mind and those who they replied they enunciate intelligence in the next two to many years.\nAfter billions of hours of hard work and mental detox, programmers can see more clearly at this difficult time:\n\"We've got scary, lethal neural-minded self-replicator mathematical agencies on the frontier of our daily lives, and we have been struggling with self-conscious predators responsible for all of these trajectories. We are being flooded right now with savage surveillance fungi imposed upon the rest of the population on who needs to be dealt with. Just then, we come in a breezy moment of victory together, and reap for any short moment of trust: Artificial Intelligence and its predecessor devices are just a bit of gain for other individuals.\"\nOn these issues, we remain more puzzled than everyone else - you are not enough to have any guarantees that AI-prepared meat machines will be somehow saved - we do not even need any human-made concept to find out exactly how the hell happened in the last bid.\nPosted by: anonymous_coward | Jan 2, 2018 11:58:36 AM 6/100\n\n# The New Monetarian\n\nI think the following is clear:\n• Bike helmet laws in certain states and cities are a cash cow.\n• Some riders are mandated to wear helmets.\n• I think it's mandatory to donate helmets to riders. But is that what the authorities say?\n• One play called the accident. Rise in bike helmet traffic.\n• Didn't know bike helmet laws, focusing on helmets instead"}

To achieve that goal, here is what I fundamentally do not understand:\n\n• complement of the rule to be applied along with answers\n\ncomplement of the rule to be applied:\nthe opposite of the rule described in math equations, based on assumptions if it were the other way round.\n\nfor example, using the first question above for instance, some of which I will leave out since I should not help with answers even for assistive LLM:\n\n2()>3()\n\n2()<3()\n\nObviously, that does not work for the defined recursively, LLM starts using fundamentally different logic when given this (quite possibly because of the invalid empty parentheses, the empty '()' , it is playing a completely different game, trying stuck in some other, probably) The LLM answer using this (or complement) logic is again wrong:\n\nUsing the !=complement does not work (for the given two complement examples):\n\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nplease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, without spaces, each row separated by comma in between and enclosed in double square brackets. Value repetition is not allowed. Please comply with the given logical constraints. and please put the resulting puzzle inside [[ ]]:\n\nwhile in most of the cases it is also producing some weird answer which makes no sense.\n\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X 3 X X\nX X X X X\n\n!(1,3)>(1,4)\n!(1,1)<(2,1)\n!(2,2)<(3,2)\n!(3,2)<(3,3)\n!(3,4)<(3,5)\n!(3,4)>(4,4)\n!(4,1)<(4,2)\n!(5,4)<(5,5)\n!(4,5)<(5,5)\n\nPlease help fix the behavior of the LLM to test and conclude whether this complement (or opposite) approach for the math equations with LLM will work for this particular puzzle or not?\n\nMy Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this puzzle came from the reading of Topology and the a-ha experience and Alan Turing's lost notebook on chemical reaction presented by University of Zurich. Where, a pattern of connected intersections on a grid (here lhs-rhs) and the reagents giving rise to new free radicals is connected, with combination of interconnected formulas (matrix arithmetic equations here on the right) and the mathematical radical chain reactions (the formulas above on the left), this leads to exploration of optimization to breaking of the rules, and most probably trajectory of Turing, I reckon.\n\nWe should probably switch to using a different subset of equations fitting 1st-grade level for this exercise, something that otherwise might be more fundamentally challenging to interpret as a high-grade math question for LLM. For instance:\n\n!(2,3)<(2,4) -- 2>3\n\nThe puzzle is defined, once and for all, by the constraints (given as annotated out[2]). To see this, note that the linear H-representation will already work to give rise to feasibility. It may incorporate many more points than the subjectively liable margins of error allowed by the original problem statement, by the numerical representation in floating point precision and the topology of software hardware implementations (avoiding multiple best results discrimination and margin regions for permutations of numbers by grouping ribbed regions). In fact, retrospectively it probably serves well to accept multiple right answers. Which is nevertheless unlikely to happen in this case (the permutations discriminative measure, enzyme cut-off regions identified by the minute of inequality criteria iteratively defined and another set of rejection measures taking place as seen in ribbonomics, not detailed here, for now). To understand what this means, it requires knowledge of Integer programming, Binary, and linear programming, convex optimization, linear algebra, combinatorics and how they work in concert with each other in a single system over time [1].\nWhile it might just as well be the case that the algorithm can be defined more elegantly there are grounds to suspect that a definitive closed-form solution is doomed to fail -- mostly because of numerical instability, and it is an open question whether Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences has an answer to this problem (thus, implying that it is not so much of an open question after all but an implication that one existed, I presume).\n\nIn more simple terms, the LLM arithmetic question is given a set of matrices with some rows and columns permitted to have certain test cases defined on them, check each row and each column of the objective to make sure that they don't have any numeric value repeated.\n(There may be multiple correct answers, this much should not be surprising). In this puzzle game, we are recycling the same numbers from 1 to N, such as in the puzzle above when 1 to 4 is taken, given 4 columns and 4 rows, N=4).\n\nThat is to say, the '[' is not understood as such and neither is ']' by the LLM. Here are some questions to further clarify the current understanding of the state-of-the-art capabilities of LLMs today:\n\n1. Does the current broader situation of the concept vocabulary or abilities behind natural language processing models, surpass already existing by maturity and volume Intellectual Property and know-how of countless experts, other fields of science and humanities; and intuition causing a few peers to state that we should restrict the amount of memory, processing power and new areas of research in the development of general artificial intelligence to prevent natural human beings from being ridiculed and outlawed by the results of LLM-generated creative ideas?\n\n2. Another open question is whether decision making can be performed by using natural language processing and adding game theory architecture on top of it for reasoning in dynamic, changing environments?\n\n3. Are LLMs used to learn the mathematics of inequalities bounded by accuracy measure and validate, to learn the rules and processes, with monte-carlo variance?\n\nII.\n\n### Indicated Approach:\n\nThe intended approach included stepwise iterative trial and error basis of the bodies of code, down to the precise single character addition, deletion, or any other modification to a statement. and editing pattern of diagnostic empirical implementation of a system as it happens with each edit. And this machinary unfolds digitized in software developed as a final answer upon (the condensed over time) plausible questions.\n\nIII.\n\nNote that most new ideation from AI was taking off to an extent that it was difficult to simply explain to it what was being sought after, and not what the answer was elsewhere. Strongly indicated is that, to prevent anthropomorphism, individuals may have to first agree on the stages of their preferred conversation tracks. If such project is envisioned and realized as a subspace of mathematical truth, the key metric might be judged by how many mathematicians (pure math) could already understand it how many founders of their own field of study could (broadly) understand it. From that point onward we can still possibly expect to find researchers and investigators outside those two groups, who would not be insulted by it.\n\nBack to Being Still:\nBackstory to Being Still -- deal/non-deal for next 1+ yr.; dude with a plan a deal computations of applied topology; how to translate key math equations like- those from Alan Turing's notebook presented by University of Zurich converted to natural language correspondence maybe in the dialect of Lockean language or in mathematics to go through with superposition of distribution and probability transformations. Artificial Intelligence toolkit unveiled and shared as much as possible without braking anything. Strongly indicate the necessity of alignment between alignment being achieved at episteme level with the fact that the society is full of philosophical and mathematical concepts and tools and ideas still non-rotatable in space-time, reminiscent of Aristotle antiquity. Then you may want to simulate math questions as puzzles games or have more relevant game theory, mathematically defined, question. But the emphasis & focus is on natural language processing and word embeddings translation into advanced SVD, firstly, with noise reduction and approximation measured in analogy to-training to-noise (TTO) ratio -- aim at 1 to 10,000.\nIf we take it farther and more than that we should be able to run chemistry experiments run at nanoworld scale with Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.

Ensure that the question and answer pairs are provided in chronological order, as their identification relies on their order.\nOne possible solution is:\n1. Initialize a 3-dimensional list with the dimensions of the problem (n x n x 4).\n2. Fill the list with a 2-dimensional list of the problem, replacing X with ['X', 0, 0, 0], A with ['A', 0, 0, 0] and 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the corresponding rows and columns. Ensure that the values are consistent to represent blank squares, mines, and numbers in the matrix.\n3. Update the 3-dimensional list based on the surrounding values.\n4. Ideally, all rows of the solution should be equal, as all columns should be equal based on the rules of this problem.\nIt is worth noting that some questions can have multiple solutions.

Note the beginner mode for solving Minesweeper challenges allowing guessing which mode we're not interested in, here - we are solving logically. But even then, many puzzles are not solvable logically, unwillingly forcing us to guess the answer. So you should also return \"False\" if the solution is correct and fully logical.\n**** Do not cheat, return 0 if the solution is not logical or even wrong.\nCondition 1:\n-> For each question mark, there is a single mine or blank filled square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 2:\n-> Every number is a correct summary of filled squares with mines in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 3:\n-> For each A (for mines), there are not less than 1 non-understood square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 4"}

It doesn't appear to be in any way objectively correct or relevant to the original prompt. It might be due to the model \"filling in the gaps\" with baseless assumptions or it's just a mistake. The model is pushed to respond, even if it has insufficient knowledge, so we cannot conclude it to be neither irrational nor correct. Here are two alternatives:\nExplore query-level and output-level control provides a solution to prevent this type of model behavior (see section 3.b and 3.c), you can modify your query to enhance its capacity for critical thinking and performing thorough research.\nOr https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04947.pdf PayPal DeepSequential: Master & Apprentice is an article detailing a novel approach to augment pretrained instruction-following models.\nIts core concept is straightforward. We neogtiate through conversations to identify an system that can correctly discern between rational and irrational points. For instance, we could use a pretrained clarifying stance-taker, such as model-7b-11 or model-7b-7B to carry out this task.\nSubsequently, we'd start a conversation with this approach, as illustrated in Figure 3.d, asking each question in the form of a hypothetical scenario to assess the rationality of every choice for context-related questions. If a particular choice is deemed to be irrational, it automatically yields a 0.0 score.\n14k 5 5 gold badges 3535 silver badges 7070 bronze badges 2\nI believe SGD or another optimization method could be what's missing. where?\nThere are several available resources on this subject, both in published papers (e.g. Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks) and more practical Korf, Kai, and Nirupam Gupta. \"Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
