There seems to be a mistake in the question as given because the operation rule correctly gives us 2 as the result of 3 ￠3, and the right side of the equation is also supposed to result in 2 to satisfy the equation. However, if we proceed under the assumption that the right side of the equation should indeed be 5 /2 (which would imply that 2 ￠X should also equal 5 /2 for the equation to hold), we can still find X.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation under the assumption that 2 ￠X should equal 5 /2:\n\n2 ￠X = 5 /2\n\nUsing the operation rule:\n\n2￠X = \\log_{X}{2} + \\log_{2}{X}\n\nSince 2 ￠X should equal 5 /2, we have:\n\n\\log_{X}{2} + \\log_{2}{X} = 5 /2\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in X, which cannot be solved algebraically in a straightforward manner. However, we can attempt to solve it numerically or graphically.\n\nGiven the complexity of the equation, it's not practical to solve it by hand. We would typically use numerical methods or computational tools to find the value of X that satisfies the equation.\n\nSince we cannot find an exact algebraic solution here, the answer to the question as posed cannot be provided accurately within the scope of this response. However, the process described outlines how one might approach solving for X in a more general context, using numerical methods or computational software to find the value of X that makes the equation true.\n\nPlease note, the answer provided above is based on the interpretation of the question under the assumption that the right side of the equation should indeed be 5 /2, as given. The operation rule itself does not support this interpretation, as 3 ￠3 clearly results in 2, not 5 /2, based on the operation rule provided."}
