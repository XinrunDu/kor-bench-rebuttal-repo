The goal of the assignment is to obtain a quantitative relationship between a group of propositional variables in a model through specific logic operations for each case. In the solution to these operations, each propositional variable takes on one of its values: true or false. As a result, in the solution to these operations, the truth value of each propositional variable becomes dependent on another proposition. In this way, one particular satisfying assignment can be easily determined for any distinct possible case.\n2. The expression for each question is an arbitrary input for all the questions. The solution set of questions consists of generated expressions.\n3. For a given proposition, each index in the appropriate expression is a new propositional variable.\n4. If the index is written in normal uppercase in the formula, then the corresponding propositional variable takes on values 1 or 0, depending on whether the value is true or false. If the index is written in lowercase in the formula, then the corresponding variable also takes on values 1 or 0, but being a binary information code, these values do not need to correspond to true and false, but can take on any values that are used in the solution set for the given operation.\n5. For each question, the solution set must clearly indicate the truth values of the assigned functions for each propositional variable D in the appropriate expression instances, and if this may not be practical to do so in order to quickly generate the result, then the explanation should still be verified as appropriate.\n6. Each question can be solved in other ways as needed.\n\n### Question 1:\nThe solution set"}

Here's a breakdown of the tasks:\n\n1. **Logical Reasoning Task:**\n   In this task, you are asked to write down formulas under specific interpretations.\n\n2. **Task A:**\n   - Given the non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N, a' = 1, functions fJ(x, y) = x*y, and gJ(x) = x+1, you were asked to implement the formula F(f(x,y),g(x)) under interpretation J.\n   - The answer is [[x*y>x+1]], which corresponds to the formula \u2200x\u2203y[x\u2032\u00d7y>a\u2032+1], derived from the given components.\n\n3. **Task B:**\n   - You were given a different set of entities, functions, and a predicate in another interpretation J.\n   - The answer is [[\u2203x(x\u22650)]], which corresponds to the formula \u2203x(x\u22640), derived from the interpretation provided.\n\n4. **Task C:**\n   - For this task, you were asked to determine the implementation of a formula under another interpretation J, given different entities, functions, and a predicate.\n   - The answer is [[2=x+1]], which corresponds to the formula 2=x+1, derived from the interpretation provided.\n\n5. **Task D:**\n   - In this task, you were asked to provide the implementation of two distinct formulas under the same interpretation J, given different entities, functions, and a predicate.\n   - The answer provided for both formulas is in [[];[]] format, corresponding to the implementation of $\\forall x \\exists y[F(f(x,a),g(y))]$ and $\\exists x[F(f(x,y),g(x,z))$.\n\nOverall, the modifications and enhancements made to the program flow help streamline the process of obtaining logical results for the given tasks while adhering to the custom-defined integration rules."}

The main problems that remained unsolved were:\n- Missing tweaks on the grammar: in order to be more grammatically correct, I did not have energy to modify the basics to create a reasonable flow in the program.\n    Writing code is dynamic, and the functions defined by the libraries were complicated, it took me time to understand how to align them so it would collapse the content for me, as well other small tweaks.\n- Changing the program to run for long periods as a script: all the key information was in the gpt-3 prompt, defining the start line of the program and the stop line, and notifying the program of the changes that needed execution for a strategic reordering.\n    this made it difficult to run as a script with the outputs taken at the end for no reason as the script was pausing after running a step for some time.\n\nI succeeded in the task because I didnt give up reaching part four, through all the same pauses in the reordering of the lines of text was able to align what was necessary for the program to run and generate results.\nStill remains some tweaking to do, mainly the major change of the content as it may outrun the scope of the logical reasoning program, though I do not think it will go way beyond the range of the items defined in the prompt, but if it already does the solution would be to modify the original text items as well.\n'''\n\n'''\nAnswers to survey question\n\n1.\n- AI tools like ChatGPT have the potential to be powerful learning tools, but they require careful setup and guidance for students to use them effectively.\n\n2.\n- I find a lot of problems in understanding the output as the system doesn't use left- and right, tags. And not alway supports my idea of explaining complex tasks.\n    I would especially suggest to try out more question& answer models, as they seem more hands on.\n\n3.\n- ChatGPt is an exciting tool for potential applications, but I don't think that ChatGPT has the capability of becoming a magic thinking device.\n    ChatGPT lives inside of the LLM including limitations and weaknesses, therefore, it will not replace active thinking or help us to perform higher-level artificial thinking.\n\n'''\n\nimport re, random,  nltk, pickle, json, nltk, requests, sys, math, os\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests, os.path, json, numpy\nfrom gpt3Functions import *\ngnrtFuncti0ns()\n\n#path_to_blob = '\\\\\\\\megminerva\\Research inmotion\\Ita\\Kendrick\\firstLevelTasks\\Data\\void'\n\nwith open ('intents.json', 'r') as file:\n    text = file.read()\n    intents = json.loads(text)\n    file.close()\n\nwith open('sample-responses.json', 'r') as sample_file:\n    sample_responses = json.loads(sample_file.read())\n    sample_file.close()\n\nwith open('licenseyear.json', 'r') as license_year:\n    license_year = json.loads(license_year.read())\n    license_year.close()\n\nwith open('pretrained_language_model.pp', 'rb') as premodel:\n    pretrained_model = pickle.load(premodel)\n    premodel.close()\n\nwith open('myModel_100_3_2_1.pickle', 'rb') as myModel:\n    myModel = pickle.load(myModel)\n    myModel.close()\n\ndef precreated(intent_name):\n    intent = intents['intents'].get(intent_name)\n    if intent: response = sample_responses[\"text\"]\n    return response\n\nprocessInput = re.compile(r'\"((0|[1-9]\\d*))\"(.)\"((0|[1-9]\\d*))\"(.)\"((word|words|num|number|numbers|nump|much|many|low|high|range|n-range|bits|many|sadly|badly|okay|fantastic|not|reasons|always|never|withdrawal|hospital|illegal|recovered|also|still|vs|from|strongly|reason|some|rather|skip|rather|unusual|means|part|parttime|many|pharmacists|drugstores|healthcare|hospitals|oncall|not)|(can|can'\n                          '\\?|no|music|tv|breakfast|lunch|dinner|midnight|evening|sunrise|sunset|bed|awake|neighbors|night|orient|dark|people|police|hospital|itcause|itcauses|why|when))')\n\nsample = { \"question\": \"Where does this fact belong?\", \"answer\": \"INFORMTION CONTAINER\" } \n\ndef sampleQuestion(text_input, sample):\n    pattern = r'(0|[1-9]\\d*)\"(.)\"((0|[1-9]\\d*)\"(.)\"((word|words|num|number|numbers|nump|much|many|low|high|range|n-range|bits|many|sadly|badly|okay|fantastic|not|reasons|always|never|withdrawal|hospital|illegal|recovered|also|still|vs|from|strongly|reason|some|rather|skip|rather|unusual|means|part|parttime|many|pharmacists|drugstores|healthcare|hospitals|oncall|not)|(can|can'\\\n                          '\\?|no|music|tv|breakfast|lunch|dinner|midnight|evening|sunrise|sunset|bed|awake|neighbors|night|orient|dark|people|police|hospital|itcause|itcauses|why|when))'\n\n    data = processInput.findall(text_input)\n\n\n    type_answer = sample[\"answer\"]\n\n    if data:\n        first_pipe = data[0][1]\n        second_pipe = data[1][1]\n        third_pipe = data[2][1]\n        fourth_pipe = data[3][1]\n        return \"Here is your answer: \" + str(type_answer) + \" \" + first_pipe + \" \" + second_pipe + \" \" + third_pipe + \" \" + fourth_pipe\n    else:\n        return sample[\"answer\"]\n\ndef task():\n    print(\"Checking your licence maximun hours of work for the year, good luck!\")\n    valid = False\n    while not valid:\n        try:\n            year = int(input(\"Enter the year:  \"))\n            licensed_user = os.path.isfile('licenseYear.json')\n            if not licensed_user:\n                license_year['yearVal'] = year\n                license"}

The assistant is designed to provide solutions, explanations, and additional resources based on the user's request.\n\nSpeaker: I, a virtual assistant, am here to help with any question or query. What can I assist you with today?\n\nUser: Could you recommend some interesting questions that involve topics like physics, astronomy, biology, or chemistry?\n\nSpeaker: Certainly! Here are five delightful questions to ponder on Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry:\n\n1. How are astronauts shielded from cosmic radiation during space missions?\n2. What is the effect of the Earth's wobble on its climate?\n3. How does climate change impact the atmospheric circulation pattern?\n4. Trace the courses of three prominent oceans as they cross continents.\n5. Can we learn about the Earth's tectonic activities through the study of fossils?\n\nSpeaker: I hope one of these topics sparks your curiosity.\n\nUser: That's great, thank you! I'll start with the question about Earth's tectonic activities.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome.\n\nUser: Can you help me understand tectonic plates and their motion?\n\nSpeaker: Yes, I can certainly assist you with that. The Earth's surface is divided into two main types of crustal plates: continental and oceanic. Over long periods, these plates move continuously due to the processes occurring within the Earth's mantle.\n\nUser: Can you explain the driving forces behind plate tectonics?\n\nSpeaker: Sure. The movement of tectonic plates is primarily triggered by a combination of forces. A key factor is convection, where heat in the Earth's mantle generates currents that cause movements within the solid sections of the crust. If the heated material from the bottom of the earth rises, it pushes the crustal plates apart or pushes them towards one another.\n\nUser: I see. You mentioned convection currents, but can you expand on the mechanism?\n\nSpeaker: Certainly. Imagine hot magma rising and cooling at different depths. This leads to the occurrence of a deep-source upwelling, which has a greater capacity for heat transfer compared to direct contact between layers. These convection cells are primarily responsible for driving tectonic plate movements.\n\nUser: Thank you for all the information about convection cells. Can you elaborate on how convection cells can drive tectonic plate movements?\n\nSpeaker: You're most welcome. Convection cells are primary drivers of tectonic plate movements. When hot material reaches the top layer of the mantle and moves upwards, it might actually encounter cool, dense rock. As a result, the hot material cools rapidly and eventually sinks back down, recreating the convection cycle. This upward and downward movement is what transmits the heat within the mantle, causing the tectonic plates to move.\n\nUser: Thanks for sharing that additional story about convection currents. As I understand, how these currents introduce changes into tectonic plate motions.\n\nSpeaker: Yes, the continuous process of heat transfer within the mantle is a continuous process. As the hot material is channeled upwards, it encounters cooler, denser material. This causes the hot material to cool rapidly and sink back down towards the base of the mantle, recreating a convection cycle. This cycle is key to understanding the long-term movement of tectonic plates.\n\nUser: That's a helpful explanation! Thanks for all your help. I know you have provided more information, but I think I now have a good understanding of tectonic forces.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome! I hope this has been a valuable learning experience. Please don't hesitate to ask more questions on this or any other topic.\n\nUser: You've been fantastic. Thank you for all your assistance.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome!

Based on these findings, we infer that the reason people tend to move later in life may be because they expect more out of life than what they currently receive.

When responding, please analyze the arguments objectively, and if there are errors, please provide a clear explanation. Example args:\n\n### Argument:\n\nRelationships between people are purely based on emotions. If someone is annoyed by another person, they will avoid the person. And, if someone is annoyed by a group, they will avoid the entire group. \n\nExample args: [[Emotions], [Make_consistent_group_decision], [Also, group decisions cannot be applied as direct application on individual person]]\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis argument employs the fallacy of **Reductio ad absurdum**. It presents an invalid premise, implying that personal judgment cannot be applied generally and consistently.\n\nThe argument suggests that emotions directly cloud judgment, implying that a person's stance towards an individual is the same as their stance towards the entire group responsible. However, emotions influence judgment, and their intensity, content, and circumstances can vary. Thinking in black and white terms does not reflect real-life situations. For instance, if an individual is upset by the actions of a group, they may come to dislike the leader or recognition of the group, which is not equivalent to avoiding the entire group.\n\n### Logical Incorrectness:\n\nThe argument incorrectly generalizes from personal experiences with groups to global statements without considering the variability in emotions, circumstances, and reasons underlying judgments. It is a fallacy known as Reductio ad absurdum, as it infers a universal conclusion from a presentation of exceptional cases.\n\n### Fallacy of Reductio ad absurdum Explanation Incorrect:\n\nThis argument commits the Fallacy of **Reductio ad absurdum** by presenting an exceptional scenario: a personal reaction towards one member of a group as a reaction towards the whole group. Reductio ad absurdum, however, would work if the argument were generalizations, as in this case, it is a fallacy since the comparison is between a single group member and a group overall.\nHere are some examples of correct statements inspired by the above argument:\n\n1. My brother was in a car accident; he was one member of the group responsible for the accident, and I will never forgive him for the pain and loss he caused us.\n2. Johnson made fun of me in public; he was one member of our group who hurt me.\n3. I fell for love; is it possible for me to fall for hatred appropriately?\n\n### Check your knowledge:\n\n1. True\n2. True\n3. True\n4. False\n\nAnswer:\n1. True\n2. True\n3. False\n4. False\n\n### Argument:\n\nLove bestows all capabilities. Loving someone truly means understanding and caring for that person's needs. In return, you yourself gain additional abilities, such as understanding the other person better and being driven by the desire to support that person. Therefore, loving is worthwhile.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThis argument uses a **Non-sequitur** fallacy by assuming that one outcome logically follows the other, despite no evidence supporting that assumption. The argument claims that love bestows capabilities without offering tangible evidence for this claim.  Furthermore, it alleges that love leads to a cycle where inner feelings drive actions, without understanding the psychological dependencies that generate actions. The argument fails to consider the moral statuses and responsibilities that come with love.\n\n### Logical Incorrectness:\n\nThe argument employs the **Non-sequitur** fallacy by assuming a causal link between loving someone and gaining abilities in a way that fails to account for other factors or intuitive behaviors. It uses a slippery slope argument by connecting two phenomena (love and emotions) without sound analysis.\n\n### True or False Explanation:\n\nTrue\n\n### Argument:\n\nThese two single nutmegs are packed into one jar together. One of these nutmegs has been crushed into a fine powder. The other nutmeg is preserved as whole. If you mix them together and take a spoonful, there'll be no way for you to know which is which.\n\nThis would not be true if you used two almonds.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe **Non-sequitur** fallacy is applied here. An almond is used as an unjust comparator to nutmeg for which there is no intention of complete accuracy. The premise mixing two nutmegs cannot be generalized to nuts, fruits, meat, or other objects.\n\nIn this case, the example fails to consider that almonds are softer and more susceptible to crushing than nutmegs. It also assumes that nutmeg powder loses its aromatic flavor upon mixing, but if properly blended, it could retain its aroma. The comparison is irrelevant, so the author intentionally presents a ridiculous scenario that cannot be generalized to represent nutmegs as a whole class of objects. Therefore, using \"nuts\" as a comparator for nutmegs is clearly an inappropriate and illogical approach.\n\nThe argument's intention is to present a sequence of events, but it exploits the absurdity of comparing nutmegs with almonds to shed a highly unreliable light on the subject. In the end, the author uses a **Non-sequitur** argument to support their flawed premise that mixing two nutmegs and choosing randomly to eat one would not be possible if one of the nutmegs was not crushed into a powder.\n\nThe example is not applicable to nutmegs as a whole category of objects."}

Based on a dataset consisting of logical rules, the program uses the atoms of the representation to perform various cognitive tasks, such as classification, search, and logical fallacy identification.\n\nThe program periodically checks for new data to train on new rules formed from this representation. Each rule in the dataset is evaluated against a set of sample questions and answers provided by users who interact with Intellegent Assistant. If these conditions are met, the new rule is added to the learning system.\n\nThe main program structure consists of a function, `agent()`, which retrieves a question from a randomly selected rule in the dataset. It retrieves a potential answer based on the parameters provided by the function and then selects an appropriate answer from the structured responses.\n\nData folder:\n    - The program retrieves data from a \"Data\" folder consisting of text files named \"agentX.txt\" where X is an integer between 0 and 29. Each file contains a series of 29 logical rules, each formatted as a sentence with approximately ten words. Rules are separated by a label BREAK. The first example rule may look like this: \"If a cat is large Enough colled a giany cat.;\"\n\nTraining module:\n    - There is a training module used to train the program on new rules. All 29 rules from 0 to 29 are tested against a series of 32 sample questions and their corresponding answers. The user is prompted to choose the rule they are most familiar with to label 10 out of 32 questions according to whether they match the rule. Labels of 1, 2, or 3 denote the question matches the rule.\n\nName errors:\n    - If the program must be restarted and the same file agent7.txt is loaded for the first time, the program will print an initial agent name \"Agent 7\". If the agent is restarted and agent7.txt is loaded for the second or third time, the random initial agent name from \"Data/agent0.txt\" will be used. This inconsistency in the initial agent name does not need to be fixed for the assignment.\n\nOutput text file:\n    - The output text file contains the testing and training results and the updated rules. The program reads the text file named \"results.txt\" in the same folder as all the questions are written there.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math\nimport re\nimport random\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n## Import the python interpreter\n\nimport sys\n ## Get the questions and the answers from the text file;\n\nimport os.path\n ## Get the current path\n\nimport glob\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\n## Used for sorting 2D lists increased by the second item.\n\n## Find the name of the python interpreter\n\nINTELLEGENT_ASSISTANT_NAME = sys.argv[1]\n\n## Import the output data of the program so that it can be compared to the contents of the original file.
