The vertical notation makes it  easy for the uniform operations over the formulas.\n\nThose examples explicitly show the importance of the distinct operators or the distinct argumentat,\nand also indicate the  uniform handling of the formulas by the vertical notation.\n\nWe go back to the original formulas.\n\nBy definition, a ○ b is a number field of the form x*a + y*b.\nIn the number field x and y are devoided of the attribute \"distinct.\"\n\nGiven the operation formulas, find the number fields of the below operation formula.\nUse the format  a○b=x*a+y*b.

As the primary educational tool to help you improve your Go knowledge, this tool has been designed to make learning easier for everyone. Our mission is to provide you with the necessary materials and resources to achieve your educational goals.\n\nFirstly, let’s discuss the importance of proper study habits. Even though you are learning Go by yourself, it’s crucial to develop effective study strategies. To begin with, break your learning goals into smaller, manageable chunks. Schedule consistent study sessions, track your progress, and implement self-graded quizzes to assess your understanding. It’s also vital to approach problems with a critical mindset, taking your time to digest and apply the information you learn. This way, you’ll be able to grasp higher-order thinking skills and stay on track.\n\nNext, we’ll cover additional educational resources. For instance, besides the Wikipedia articles, consider referring to reputable textbooks or online courses. Interactive platforms like Duolingo or the website can also be valuable tools for enhancing your learning experience. These resources offer hands-on experience, feedback, and immediate reinforcement of your understanding of the topic.\n\nTo make learning even more effective, consider approaching it from multiple angles. Look for resources that enrich your learning experience in different ways. For example, complement theoretical studies with practical exercises, watch videos and animations, or even explore interactive simulations. This immersive learning will help you understand the topic more deeply and increase your knowledge retention.\n\nFinally, it’s essential to connect with other learners. Learning in a community atmosphere has numerous benefits. For one, you’ll have access to a pool of knowledgeable peers who can provide support, guidance, and inspiration. Interacting in forums and discussing your learning challenges encourages critical thinking and collaboration.\n\nIn conclusion, to become the successful Go learner you aspire to be, you must cultivate effective habits, utilize appropriate resources, provide yourself with a holistic educational experience, and form connections with like-minded individuals. With these tools, you’ll build a solid foundation for your Go education and see your knowledge truly bloom.\n\nOutput:\nMy name is Ethan I will help you with Go knowledge.\nWe haven't discussed Go knowledge yet.
