Separate conditions with 'or' if there are multiple conditions.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[you answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To tackle this problem, we first need to understand the given sets and their definitions:\n\n- Set A: This is defined as containing all real numbers. In set notation, this can be represented as: $A = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\n- Set B: This is defined as containing all real numbers such that $x^2$ is less than 1. Written in set notation: $B = \\{x \\mid x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nNow, we need to perform the custom operation A￡B:\n\n$A￡B = (A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B)$\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n$A \\cup B$ - The union of sets A and B contains elements that are in either set A or set B (or in both). In this case, $A \\cup B$ will include all real numbers (as set A covers all real numbers) and also include the elements of set B (which is $x$ such that $x^2 < 1$). So, the union will be represented as $A \\cup B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ or } x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\n$A \\cap B$ - The intersection of sets A and B contains elements that are in both set A and set B. In our case, this will be elements that are real numbers and satisfy the condition $x^2 < 1$. This simplifies to $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nNow that we have these two sets, we can subtract the intersection from the union:\n\n$(A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B) = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ or } x^2 < 1\\} - \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 < 1\\}$\n\nTo determine this difference, we compare the two sets. Any element that is in the first set but not in the second set will be part of the final answer. In this case, the solution set will include all real numbers that are not in the intersection (i.e., not those satisfying $x^2 < 1$). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $A￡B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 \\geq 1\\} =$ **[**$\\left\\{x \\mid x \\leq -1 \\text{ or } x \\geq 1\\right\\}$**]"}
