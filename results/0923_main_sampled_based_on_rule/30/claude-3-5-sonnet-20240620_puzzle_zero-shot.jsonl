Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The game gives a formula of letters, each representing a unique number (0-9). \n2.Different letters cannot represent the same number.\n3.The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0.\n\n### Question:\nEAT+THAT=APPLE.\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the equation: EAT + THAT = APPLE\n\n2. Given the rule that different letters cannot represent the same number, we have 6 unique letters: E, A, T, H, P, L\n\n3. Since 'A' appears in both \"EAT\" and \"APPLE\", it cannot be 0 (as per rule 3).\n\n4. The sum of two 3-digit numbers results in a 5-digit number, so 'A' in APPLE must be 1.\n\n5. For the equation to work, T + T must end in E, which is only possible if T = 5 and E = 0.\n\n6. Now we have: 0A5 + 5HA5 = APP10\n\n7. For this to be true, H must be 9, as it's the only way to get a carry over to make A = 1 in the result.\n\n8. We're left with P and L. The only way for the hundreds column to work is if P = 8.\n\n9. Finally, L must be 7 to make the tens column correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n[[E=0,A=1,T=5,H=9,P=8,L=7]]"}

The only possibility is 1 and 5.\n   - (4,3)(5,3):2÷ means one number divided by the other is 2. The only possibility is 4 and 2.\n   - (4,5)(5,5):2- means the difference between these numbers is 2.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. We start with a 4x4 grid, so we'll use numbers 1 to 4.\n2. We have two pre-filled numbers: 2 in the top-left corner and 3 in the bottom-right corner.\n3. We need to consider the inequality constraints:\n   (1,2) > (1,3)\n   (2,2) > (2,3)\n   (3,1) < (3,2)\n\nLet's solve:\n\n1. In the first row, we know 2 is in the first position. Given (1,2) > (1,3), the second position must be 4, and the third must be 3 or 1. The fourth must be whatever is left (1 or 3).\n\n2. In the last row, we know 3 is in the last position. The other numbers must be 1, 2, and 4 in some order.\n\n3. Given (3,1) < (3,2), the first number in the third row must be smaller than the second. The only possibility that doesn't conflict with the first row is 1 2 4 3.\n\n4. Now, for the second row, we need to fill in the remaining numbers. Given (2,2) > (2,3), and considering the numbers already used in other rows, the second row must be 3 4 1 2.\n\n5. This leaves us with 4 1 3 2 for the first row, which satisfies (1,2) > (1,3).\n\nTherefore, the complete solution is:\n\n2 4 1 3\n3 4 1 2\n1 2 4 3\n4 1 2 3\n\nFormatting the answer as requested:\n\n[[2 4 1 3,3 4 1 2,1 2 4 3,4 1 2 3]]"}

We have one pre-filled number: 3 at position (4,3).\n3. Let's apply the inequality constraints:\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. (3,2)<(3,3): Since 3 is at (4,3), (3,3) must be 4 or 5.\n2.

This is a 5x5 grid, so skyscraper heights will range from 1 to 5.\n\n2. Starting with the most constraining clues:\n   - Row 2 has a '1' on the left, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n   - Column 2 has a '4' on top, meaning the buildings must be in ascending order (1,2,3,4,5).\n   - Column 4 has a '1' on top, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n\n3. Filling in these known values and continuing to apply the rules:\n\n   2  4  3  1  2  \n4  X  1  X  5  X  1\n1  5  2  X  X  X  2\n3  X  3  X  X  X  3\n2  X  4  X  X  X  4\n3  X  5  X  X  X  5\n   3  2  2  2  1  \n\n4. Now, we can deduce more:\n   - In row 1, we need 2,3,4 to complete it. The '4' on the left means it must be in descending order.\n   - In column 1, we need 1,2,3,4 to complete it. The '3' at the bottom means 4 can't be at the bottom.\n   - In column 5, we need 1,2,3,4,5. The '1' at the bottom means 5 must be at the bottom.\n\n5.
