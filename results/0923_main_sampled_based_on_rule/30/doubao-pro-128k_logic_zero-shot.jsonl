This is clearly false for all \ud835\udc65 in the set of natural numbers except 0. So the left-hand side of the implication is false for all \ud835\udc65 except 0.\n\nThe right-hand side of the implication is \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66), which means \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc66.\n\nPutting it all together, the implementation of the formula under \ud835\udc3d is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&(\\forall x(F(0, x) \\to F(x, y)))^J\\\\\n=&(\\forall x((x \\neq 0) \\to (x = y)))^J\\\\\n=&[((\\neg (x = 0)) \\to (x = y))]^J_{x \\in N}\\\\\n=&[((x \\neq 0) \\to (x = y))]_{x \\in N}\n\\end{align*}\n\\] "}

Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[*]] "}
