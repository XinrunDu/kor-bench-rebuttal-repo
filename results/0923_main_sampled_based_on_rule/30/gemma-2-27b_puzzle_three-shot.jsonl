tents.\n5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.\n6.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.\n7.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, and X, which represents the spaces,To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X T X X T X 3\nX T X X X X X X X X 1\nX X X T T X X X X X 3\nT X X X X X T T X X 1\nX T X X T X X X X X 2\n2 1 1 1 1

this question, you need to convert arrows into numbers and output paths for easier reading.\nIf we use the first question as an example, the arrow distribution can be converted to a matrix for interpretation:\n6 8 5\n\n8 5 2\n\n1 4 0\nThe meanings corresponding to the numbers are as below:\n1 = ↑ 2 = ↗ 3 = →\n4 = ↘ 5 = ↓ 6 = ↙\n7 = ← 8 = ↖ 0 = ○\nThe small arrow in the figure indicates the starting point and the center point indicates the ending point.\nThe puzzle-answering step is as follows:\nStarting from the first inflection point, traverse the first line until the second inflection point, looking for the path\nLooking for the path, traversing from the first line until after the second inflection point, the path turns from right to left\nAccording to the rule of the second inflection point, continue to traverse through the second line to the third inflection point, and find that the path should turn upwards\nSince the third inflection point does not fall on a straight line, it is difficult to make a general judgment about the turning of the path, so it is necessary to find the orientation of the third inflection point, and such information is also necessary\n\nsuch information is also necessary for intersection points because it indicates which direction the path will continue, in this case following the direction of the second line, but if the third line exists, it would overturn the following along the third direction of the intersection point and so on.\nThe end of the solution is the end point, and there is no turning direction to look for the next inflection point, so the answer is [1,0,2],[0,0,0],[0,0,3]\nThere are three lines in the direction of movement, and the horizontal line is crossed. If the initial pointing direction of intersection For example, it is a vertical line, then it is necessary to pay attention to the vertical line at the inflection point after the intersection when looking for the direction of the intersection. intersection.\nHowever, it seems that most of the die products are horizontal and vertical lines, which indicates that as long as the horizontal horizontal line is first looked for, and the turning direction is checked according to the information,  then the solution will be continuous.\nSo the question is, how can I get the information quickly and efficiently?\nThe first method I thought of was that arrays are strings, arrays can be sliced, and strings can be sliced.\nI think it can be interpreted using numpy, extracting the components of the array from every angle.\nThe first part of the interpretation directly extracts the diagonal, the second and third parts of the interpretation extract the horizontal horizontal lines, and the fourth part is some of the cases of the intersection of other consecutive turns of the path.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    for i in matrix:\n        print(i)\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    l = 3\n    w = len(matrix)\n    for n in range(l):\n        if n < (l-1):\n            str1 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n])\n            str2 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+1])\n            str3 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+2])\n            str4 = str1[0] + str2[1:w-1] + str3[w-1]\n        else:\n            str4 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[l-1])\n        print(str4)\n        print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n\nzuobiao = np.array([[7, 0, 4, 0, 7],\n                   [8, 7, 1, 1, 8],\n                   [0, 7, 2, 4, 3],\n                   [0, 1, 5, 5, 1],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nextract_array(zuobiao)\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n  [8 7 3 1 0]\n  [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [8 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 0 1 0 0]\n [0 0 1 4 5]]\n\n\nIt's great, so I had to see if it was suitable for long numbers: \nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    # Put your code here\n     for i in matrix:\n         print(i)\n    print(\"=========\")\n    l = len(matrix)\n    "}
