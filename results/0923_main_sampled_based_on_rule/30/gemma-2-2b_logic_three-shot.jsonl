Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic formula D. All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, \u00ac(p\u2227q)\u2227\u00acw can be written either as \u00acp\u2227\u00ac\u00acq\u2227\u00acw [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or \u00acp\u2227(\u00acq\u2227\u00acw) \u2228 \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acw (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of \u00acp\u2194p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, \u00acp\u2228\u00acq is logically equivalent to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq. In contrast, \u200b\u00ac(p\u2228q)\u00acr\n][1] is not a logical implication of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u00acr because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition \u00acp\u2228q\u00acr can be reduced to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2228\u00acr.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p\u2228\u00acp^(\u00acq\u2227\u00acr) -p^\u00acq^\u00acr (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p\u2228\u03c8` the [`p\u2227\u00ac\u03c8\u2019 `p\u2227\u03c8](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & \u00acA)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P \u2228 Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. \u00acQ (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q \u2228 \u00acP (disjunction). When it is true \u00ac(\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) is true \u2227(\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ)] (logical \u2228). When it is true ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q)) = \u00acP \u2228Q] ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q) = P \u2228 Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P \u2228 Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A \u2228 \u2227(B \u2228 C ... N.) for the DNF `(A \u2228 (B \u2228 (C \u2228 ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) \u2228/\u2228[(X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z \u2228 ... N. \u2228 X \u2228 Y). \u2228 (X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z ... N) \u2228X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p\u2227q\u2227r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p \u2227 (q \u2227 r))))) \u2227((q \u2227 (p \u2227 r))) \u2227((r \u2227 (p \u2227 q)))] \u2227((r \u2227 (p & (q \u2227 r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p \u2227 Q)(p \u2227 R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P \u2228 Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: \u00ac(\u00acA\u2227\u00acB)\u2192(A\u2228B) ((\u00ac A\u2228\u00ac B)\u2192( A\u2227 B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P \u2228 Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging.

If x is a circle, x is a sphere.\nIllustration:\nFor each circle x,x is like a sphere, because every circle can be like the Sun when the Earth is stationary.\nAnalysis: If an object x meets the definition of 'circle', and it is still consistent with this definition after adding x has \"capacity to revolve\", then x also coincides with the definition of 'circle' after the change. Therefore, x cannot be a sphere.\nProof:\n1. If x is a circle, then it also has \"capacity to revolve\".\n2. If a circle has 'capacity to move freely', it is the Sun.\n3. If an object x is the Sun, then x is a sphere.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n\n\n2. If x is a quadrilateral, x cannot be a regular one.\nIllustration:\nTake the square as an example, the sides of the square form a regular quadrilateral, but they are not a regular one.\nAnalysis: The definition of 'circle' has a number of conditions to satisfy, to ensure the meaning of 'circle', which is consistent with some rules of 'circle'. The definition of 'quadrangular' has a number of conditions to satisfy, but it is not based on the combination of some concepts to form a regular one, because there is no combination of two or more sets of 'triangle', and squares are all quadrilaterals , so it is a kind of regular one, not conform to a definition of 'quadrangular'.\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrilateral, then x has at least one of the 4 types of 'triangle', the regular one included.\n2. If x has 'triangle', and it is a regular one, then x agrees with the definition of 'quadrangular' but is not a regular one.\n3. Therefore, if x is not a quadrilateral, then it cannot be a regular one.\nConclusion: If x is a quadrilateral, then x cannot be a regular one.\n\n\n3. All quadrangles (are) quadrilateral?\nIllustration:\nSquares, trapezoids, rhombi are all quadriangular, but not just added.\nAnalysis: quadrilateral(is)quadrangular(be) can be regarded as a conclusion. Its entry must agree with the definition of quadrangle (or triangular), can be interpreted as saying that a quadrilateral is quadrilateral absolutely correct. Since the squares' definition is the combination of regular tetrahedron and diagonal triangle, since the two pieces of a regular tetrahedron embedded in this tetrahedral combination and the line of two of the corners of the rhombus are the sum of the diagonal triangle's description, is consistent with the definition of triangular, which is called a quadrangle absolutely correct from quadrilateral definition. So the correct one conclusion is truly the meaning quads(is)quadrangular(be)\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrangle, then it must be a combination of quadrilateral or triangular.\n2. If x is a combination of quadrilateral, x is quadangled.\nConclusion: x is a quadrilateral wherever it is.\n\n### Question:\nProve the following propositions using analytical and judgment principles (3 hypotheses and 1 conclusion).\n\n1. If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n2. If x is a sphere, then x is a planet.\n3. If x is a planet, then x has an orbital ring around it.\n\nA total of 3 propositions must be proven. Prove the following 3 pairs of propositions in order using the Homological Domain:\n\n(1) 1 and 3 (2) 1 and 2 (3) 2 and 3\n\nDetermine which combinations can be proved at a time. Do not repeat the same proposition or use the same proposition combination twice (such as using the statement\"if A, then B\" and \"if B, then A\" in the same part). Assuming that your reasoning order and the verification of the principle sequence of the conditions will be considered during the examination of non-mathematical errors, such as arbitrary creation of Proposition, intentional reversal of inference, and substitution of the conclusion of a statement with a false proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n1. If x is not the sphere, then it is the sun.\nIllustration:\nLet the circle be the sun, as the sun, with a ring of orbital mirror around the edge, and there is a circle, which is not just a planet. If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\nAnalysis:\n If x is a circle, by definition, x is not just a sun and a spherical surface with an interstellar ring around the edge.\nIf x is a sphere, and x has a spherical surface, a belt is hanging around, and the edge is oval, x is a planet.\nIf x is a planet, then the spiral has to be around it too.\nProof:\n1. If a circle is not a sphere, the sun is not obviously.\n2. If x is a sphere with a ring of orbital mirrors like the sun, x is clearly a planet.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\n\n2. If x is not the planet, then x is a cube.\nIllustration:\nThe diameter of the planet is an arm\u2019s distance, and its outer edge is an arm\u2019s distance.\nAnalysis:\nIf the planet is not a sphere, the diameter of the planet cannot be an arm\u2019s distance, so a planet can be small that can accommodate the body. If x is a sphere, and x has an oval outer surface, the width of x\u2019s radius is smaller than an arm, so the outer hex radius can also be smaller than an arm\u2019s distance. Therefore, x is not the cube (is not a sphere or planet (is) cube).\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, it is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a sphere with a belt-like ring around its legs, then it must be the cube, because the radius is smaller than the arm.\nConclusion: If x is a planet, then x is a cube.\nConclusion: x can not be the cube.\n\n3. If x is not the cube, then x has a memory.\n1. Every continent has enough room to hold half of the world.\n2. Only the space on the bottom of the world and in orbits is available, so if anything exists in the universe, there must be something in the orbit.\nAnalysis:\nIt may be a cube, it has no core;\nbecause the volume of the cube is very large, it cannot be stored within three continents, which is too small. Therefore, the only possibility is that there is no core to make the volume look huge.\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, x is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a planet\u2019s spherical surface, orbiting x orbit 1 is absolutely impossible and can be ruled out, so x must be x, so x is the Sun.\n3. If x is a sphere orbiting x, then it must be a planet, and it is impossible to have a planet within the orbiting distance, so x is not a permanent one.\nConclusion: If x is a cube, then x has a core.\nConclusion: x is not a cube.\nWith the combination of propositions is not enough to prove.\n1, 2, 3 are sufficient conditions/not enough conditions, they can only prove a relationship between proposition/can not prove the truth of the combination of propositions, need to use the corresponding way to proved to be not enough to prove truth.\n\n### Question:\nSymbolise and verify the following proposition using the analytical principle (analogy principle) and judgment principle (proof by contradiction principle).\n\n(1) (A1 v A 2) \u21d2 ((( A 2 \u039b A 1) \u039b (( A 1 \u039b A 2) \u039b ( A 1 \u039b A 2))) \u039b (( A 1 \u039b A 2) \u039b ( A 1 \u039b A 2)\n\n(2) A 2\u039b(A 1 \u039b("}

[c1 + c2]\u03c6\n  - The possibility exists that `\u03c6` is true after executing one or both commands.\n3. [c1; c2]\u03c6\n  - After executing the commands, `\u03c6` has the characteristics of both `c1` and `c2`.\n4. \u27e8c1; c2\u27e9\u03c6\n  - After executing `c1`, the situation after executing `c2` can be represented as if `\u03c6` is true.\n5. \u27e8c1 + c2\u27e9\u03c6\n  - Any of the processes `c1` or `c2` makes `\u03c6` possible.\n6. [[c1; c2]\u03c6]\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can be represented as `\u03c6`.\n7. [c1; c2]\u03c6\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can contain or include `\u03c6`.\n\nThis may sound more convoluted, but it is the result of a series of transformations based on the structure of the rule language. The basic idea is to use logical operations such as substitution, sequence, choice, loop, and interrupt as a process or description of execution. For example, when executing command `c2 + c1`, the first command is likely to be completed successfully, then execute the second command, the resulting situation will be as if `\u03c6` is true. In a broader sense, even when `c1` succeeds, `\u03c6` is still possible, because after using `c1 + c2`, the system can still enter the resource limitation state and then the exception state, which will lead to `errorCode`. Finally, when executing the command `c1; c2`, the outcome can be described as `\u03c6` plus both `c1` and `c2`, and the successful execution can result in termination or the situation as if `\u03c6` is true.\n<img src=\"https://img2.imgso.cn/flow/e476b21f247217727d793596488/jionefh66.png\" width=\"800\" border=\"0\" />"}

For the result shown as ( GroupA) to be in GroupB, GroupA] must participate in GroupB. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupA, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupA.\n\nThe rule in GroupA is as follows. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in GroupC, so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in (GroupA), so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupC.\n\nIn conclusion, as detailed above,\n\nGroupA: (B/A/()), GroupB: (B/A/). GroupC: (C/B/A/()).\n\nThis situation is called a puzzle that answers the questions, etc., in a logic puzzle using many variables and sub-variables.\n"}

They observed that the larger plant grew at a slightly faster rate than the smaller one.\n\nAccording to the LS Paradox, which of the following might be true?\n\nA. The smaller plant is likely to grow more slowly in the near future due to observable past trends being reversed.\nB. The smaller plant is more likely to grow faster in the long term due to the student's familiarity with large plants and the tendency for smaller plants to catch up with their slow growth.\nC. The larger plant is more likely to grow faster in the near term because it has more resources available to it, but the small plant has more resources in the long term.\nD. The two plants are growing at similar speeds in the short term due to their environmental conditions and equipment, but the larger plant is more likely to grow more quickly overall in the long term.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C/D]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]"}

At the same time, [C] may have a request, but they put it in a seemingly non-requesting structure and may also try to seek second and third opinions. This is an expression of sincerity, and it's a way to avoid using direct language to directly ask questions, maybe also to avoid missing the feeling of the other party while asking directly. If it was \"Excuse, do you have a suggestion?\" or \"Do you have any advice?\" maybe the possibility of misunderstanding will be relatively high. To try to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding, the sentence of C is indeed very suitable.\n\nIt is difficult to define the logical structure and meaning of C's sentence in terms of the 3 different logical grammar concepts (C*, C%, C!) in here.\n\nWhich principles does this dialogue conform to at three levels?\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n- The level of C* Principle: \"A: \"The battery in my watch has run out, and it takes about 2 to 3 business days to receive a new one.\"\" B: \"I think it's faster to replace the battery yourself if it's really fixed so seriously\".\" C: \"I'll make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, and he can handle it in about an hour after doing some preliminary tests.\"\n- The level of C% Principle:\"A: \"The report is ready now, complete with all the tables and figures you requested.\" B: \"We got late because we got caught in a traffic jam en route to work.\" C: \"I woke up late and my daughter accidentally poured milk on my new shoes.\"\n- The level of C! Principle:\"A: \"The battery in my watch has run out, and it takes about 2 to 3 business days to receive a new one.\" B: \"I think it's faster to replace the battery yourself if it's really fixed so seriously.\"\" C: \"I'll make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, and he can handle it in about an hour after doing some preliminary tests.\"\n- The above C answers are roughly classified into three formats semantically, in the sense of language, which are the level of C* Principle, C% Principle and C! Principle. From the results of the interpretation of C answers, we found that the level of C** Principle and level of C% Principle are identical, the relationship between the two can be described as \"C% Principle = C** Principle\". From a linguistic perspective, it is hard for [C] to be represented as a sentence with the 3 principles above.

To get this answer, you must understand the principles related to information enhancement and constraints.\n\nThe following are some core principles:\n\n- \"Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" and \"Minimalization Criterion\": This information also affects C* and C%! It focuses on ensuring that the statement avoids being too weak when determining its content from information, and it also attaches importance to expressing the content that can be established within the least amount of language. This principle is similar to C* Principle and C% Principle.\n- \"Speak as little as possible.\" and \"Expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech: This information mainly applies to C%. It emphasizes that when conveying information, you should strive to reduce redundancy or blur the content, and it also restricts the length and structure of the sentence.\n- The less comprehensive the information, the more probable it is to regard the statement as \"an extension.\" Usually the expression \"not entailing the content of the sentence\" is less commonly used in C% Principle, and the information provided by C is more frequently in contrast to C* Principle. This reflects the idea that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows.\"\n- \"Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason\": This information usually satisfies C! Principle. It emphasizes that when expressing information, you should avoid using lengthy, convoluted, or marked expressions that are not particularly relevant, nor should you put additional information into the expression beyond what is necessary."}

If this song is happy, then this song cannot also be sad. Therefore, the song demonstrates that A song cannot be both happy and sad\" This argument incorrectly equates two incompatible logical predicates (happy and sad) on the same class (\"song\"); if someone says the song is happy, it cannot also be sad.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

This argument incorrectly uses the premise to infer a contradiction; it incorrectly assumes that only those married before can remarry, which infers that those who are not married before cannot remarry.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

On the condition that you have bird, cat and food, i.e., given that I have a bird, it does not follow that I also have a cat and food. Therefore the proposition is called an Invalid Fallacy of Observation.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD. IncorrNeg Method\nE.

This argument incorrectly applies an assumption from a logical relationship to a relationship in the real world, making an erroneous conclusion.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

Therefore, this argument is, logically, not an argument that undermines itself, but a logically valid one.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC.
