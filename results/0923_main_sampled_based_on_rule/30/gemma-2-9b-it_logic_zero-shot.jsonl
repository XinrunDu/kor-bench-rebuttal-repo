Li Gua did not murder his boss, so Li Gua is not an evil person. This reasoning is obviously unsound. The act of murder (regardless of whether it is the boss) can indeed make a person an evildoer, but evildoers are not limited to murderers; there are many other forms of wrongdoing. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that \"Li Gua is not an evil person\" from \"Li Gua did not murder someone.\"\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC.
