Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven that (p1=::>(p1||p2))&((p1&p2)=::>p1) is a Truth Formula, determine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\n(2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\n\nA.

Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nUsing Basic Equivalences (14), what equivalent expression is obtained by removing all occurrences of > in (p > q) & (p > !q)?\nThe answer is a logical expression formatted as [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[!p]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the rules, are !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r equivalent?\nA.

The algorithm requires iterating through each pair of entities, hence the complexity is proportional to the square of the number of iterations. This time complexity can be justified by analyzing the process of determining the implementation of formulas under J, which involves operations that grow quadratically with the size of the input. The Big-O notation concisely expresses the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm's running time, indicating the algorithm's complexity as O(n^2). In this case, the time complexity is mainly dominated by the number of iterations, which is proportional to the square of the size of the input. The algorithm's computational requirements increase as inputs grow larger, making it necessary to choose appropriate data structures and implementations to manage memory efficiently and mitigate the impact of high computational complexity on resource usage."}

true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E

Proposition P2 indicates that it is morally forbidden for individuals to harm others within social connections.\n\nApplying reasoning formula 7, which relates moral duties and permissions, we can infer the correct conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is that there is a moral obligation for individuals to strive to maintain social relationships.\n\nRationale: Reasoning formula 7 implies that if an action is prohibited, then its opposite\u2014the opposite action\u2014is allowed. Since Proposition P2 prohibits harm to others in social relations, the opposite action of maintaining social relationships is implicitly allowed. This reasoning formula suggests that if an action is prohibited, its corresponding opposite action is allowed."}

Please answer the following three questions. For each question, there are three subquestions. Please give the answers in standard order [[1.1, 1.2, 1.3...].\n1. You have the function f(x). Given any function g(x), how can you write g(f(x)), i.e., to calculate the value of g(f(x)) using g(x)?\n1.1. Given a small example with a specific value for g(x) and a simple function for f(x), please write out the calculations for g(f(x)).\n1.2. Assume the polynomial function f(x) and the simple function g(x) are provided. Please write out the general equation for g(f(x)).\n1.3. Given a polynomial function f(x) and a simple function g(x), please write out the general equation for g(f(x)). Note that f(x) is a polynomial while g(x) is a simple function.\n\n2. For the polynomial f(x), is it possible to determine whether it has derivative functions and whether each function is unique?\n2.1.

Write the logic for problem decomposition and solution based on these principles.\n3.2. Given a specific example with specific variables, please analyze the solution steps and verify whether they can be applied to solving larger problems.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1.3. To calculate g(f(x)), please replace each occurrence of x in g(x) with the expression \"f(x)\". ]]\n\n[[2.1. Yes, derivative functions are unique for every polynomial function. Here's a description of how to find and test derivative functions:\nWe can divide the domain of a polynomial into intervals where the polynomial exhibits non-decreasing behavior. On each interval, the derivative is a function that has the same sign, which can be determined by considering the value of the derivative at the interval endpoints. This derivative can be obtained from the function's derivative function. For example, the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 has derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1. On intervals where the derivative is non-zero, we can have non-decreasing behavior. Any function whose derivative is equal to f'(x) is a possible derivative function for f(x).]]\n\n[[3.2.

Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills.

After preparation and revision, J was self-assured about their presentation and felt satisfied with their work. The day before the presentation, J started preparing a backup presentation due to misgivings about the performance of the presentation tool, but J did not bring printed backup materials. During the actual presentation, the presentation tool failed to display slide content and only displayed the effect of animated images without words. Fortunately, J quickly transferred the slides to a computer using a U disk and continued the presentation on this machine, effectively getting the presentation done on time.\n\nPlease explain which principle shaped J\u2019s behavior, and the specific reasoning processes required to derive this.\n\n### Answer:\nA's Behavior and Rationale:\nIn the last given scenario, J presents a relatively rational behavior. The reason is that they overestimated how well their presentation tools would perform in delivering the presentation, and accordingly, they did not think it necessary to bring a backup version of the printed presentation materials. However, the situation took a different turn once the presentation tools started to malfunction during the actual presentation. J immediately took decisive action to get a backup version of the presentation ready on a computer using a U disk.\n\nJ's behavior was driven by the principle of minimalization under uncertainty \u2013 a principle that dictates speaking as little as possible, only speaking to the necessary extent to achieve the goals of communication. In other words, they did not bring a backup version of the presentation, believing in the reliability of the presentation tools. However, when the tools faltered during the actual presentation, J responded immediately, showing their intention to express even a small extra (minimal) content by switching to a new tool, U disk.\n\nApplying Minimalization:\nIn the context of Minimalization, J's behavior can be described interms of minimizing the effort spent on bringing extra backup materials, with the expectation that they would not need them since they trusted the presentation tools. However, when the tools failed during the presentation, it became clear that minimalization had been ineffective. By adding a U disk, J was able to bring a backup version of the presentation and speech to the device. This additional expression was not previously required but became essential once the malfunction occurred. In this case, Minimalization dictates that J speaks as minimally as possible, not making decisions or bringing backup materials until the minimal content requirement - the presentation tools performing their task - becomes clear.\n\nIn sum, J's actions under minimalization drove their ability to effectively use a U disk to save the presentation in a situation where the presentation tools malfunctioned. This exemplifies the dynamic process of Minimalization in discourse planning and communication.\n\n### Extra Hint:\nRemember to give your answer using the specified format.\n"}

The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !

AffCons method: When the premise is that if P then Q, knowing that Q is true, it is mistakenly believed that P is also true, and does not meet this prompt. 3.CondSwap method: When the premise is that if P then Q, it is mistakenly believed that if Q then P, and does not meet this prompt. The subject matter of the conclusion and judgment are in the same position in both the premise and the conclusion. 4. IncorrNeg method: When the premise is that if P then Q, it is mistakenly believed that if P is not, Q is also not true, and it does not meet the prompt.\n\nIn this example, the question clearly gave a certain species condition, and the reasoner clearly made a conclusion, 2. IncorpNeg, Aff Cons, DisjSyl, Negent, CondSwap is used. 4. It should be obvious that the reasoner makes an incorrect negative judgment. The question does not ask what logical mode is used, but what logic should be used to solve the problem. As the reasoner has not made any correct steps, the answer is only the type of logic used-neg ant method."}
