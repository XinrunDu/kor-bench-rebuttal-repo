it with '#' in a way that the number of filled points is as close as possible to the number of points that satisfy the following rules:\n\n\n1.For every '#' on a white point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' (within 2 grids means it is in squares where 1 grid is the border of the 2 grids).\n2.For every '#' on a black point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' points (the same as 1).\n3.There is at least one '#' on each point.\n\nEvery input file is guaranteed to have an answer.\n\n### Format for input and output:\nThe format for input and output is as follows:\n[input]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n[output]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n\nOne line represents a picture, only alpha (alpha is used to represent a character in a String).\n\nOne line describes the output result.\n\n### Examples:\n```\nInput:[1][.......x][......xxx][..xx.xxxxx][xx.x.....][........x]\n\nOutput:\n[[1][x......][x......][x.....xx.]]\n```\n\n### Input:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx.x.x\n\n### Output:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx#x#x\n\n\n### Hint:\nConsider applying the rules one at a time to determine the number of empty spaces.\nFor example, you can start with rule 1 and determine which points require '#' under rule 1.

**Rule:** Solve a custom puzzle problem using a specific rule. Verify answer aligns with rule and puzzle context.\n- **Instructions/ Steps:** Understand rule, apply accurately to question, verify answer, and format response correctly.\n- **Puzzle Rules:** Rule for a custom puzzle: arrows, numbered squares, arrows cannot cross, blank squares covered by arrows.\n- **Question:** 9 puzzles are included as matrices; arrows must be placed to cover blank spaces using arrows.\n- **Answer:** Arrows must be placed; each puzzles answer will be given in the form of a matrix. Output all arrows for each puzzle.\n- **Result:** Ensure your final answer is formatted with correct double brackets, separated by spaces and commas.\n\n### Use case for sample code:\n- The use case for the sample code is to provide an example of how to generate Python code to solve a puzzle using the specified rules. The code should be able to accurately apply the rule to the question presented and verify its answer.\n"}
