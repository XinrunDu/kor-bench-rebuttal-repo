Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

There's an issue with correctness related to inclusion of additional characters due to the erroneous reading of filled rows and placeholder understanding. Proper reconstruction should result in:\n\nProper analysis without placeholder consideration:\n- RTFDY\n- YOE\n\nMerging these after decoding the alternation correctly would result in \"RTFDYOE\", where placeholder removal isn't even required, assuming accurate symbol decoding originally. My initial explanation contains an error during decoding which needs realignment to match expected patterns based on the rule set provided.\n\n[[RTFDYOE]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"AXVXGFAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Divide the ciphertext into two halves:\n   - Upper half: \"AXVXGFAGXG\"\n   - Lower half: \"FAVFVGAXFG\"\n\n2. Using the encrypted character set \"ADFGVX\", find each character's position in the set:\n   - A = 0, D = 1, F = 2, G = 3, V = 4, X = 5\n\n3. Pair up from the two halves like (AX), (VX), (GF), (AG), (XG), (FA), (VF), (VG), (AX), (FG) and determine the matrix coordinates:\n   - (AX) corresponds to (0, 5)\n   - (VX) corresponds to (4, 5)\n   - (GF) corresponds to (3, 2)\n   - (AG) corresponds to (0, 3)\n   - (XG) corresponds to (5, 3)\n   - (FA) corresponds to (2, 0)\n   - (VF) corresponds to (4, 2)\n   - (VG) corresponds to (4, 3)\n   - (AX) corresponds to (0, 5)\n   - (FG) corresponds to (2, 3)\n\n4. Use the matrix to obtain the letters for each coordinate pair:\n   - Matrix at (0, 5) = B\n   - Matrix at (4, 5) = N\n   - Matrix at (3, 2) = G\n   - Matrix at (0, 3) = 0\n   - Matrix at (5, 3) = O\n   - Matrix at (2, 0) = H\n   - Matrix at (4, 2) = I\n   - Matrix at (4, 3) = 3\n   - Matrix at (0, 5) = B\n   - Matrix at (2, 3) = F\n\n5.

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - e: 263\n    - n: 299\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x of the value corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Compute x^e mod n as the ciphertext number y for that letter p . Here ^ denotes the multiplication operation.\n    - Finally, concatenate all the y's and separate them with commas for the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - e: 263\n    - n: 299\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Calculate z = c^e mod n. Here ^ means multiplication.\n        Based on the decimal number represented by z, use the ascii code to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"54\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
