Starting with \\(p>q\\), by rule (10), it is equivalent to \\(!p | q\\).\n   - Therefore, \\((p>q)>r\\) becomes \\((!p | q)>r\\).\n   - Applying rule (10) again, we get \\((!p | q)>r \\equiv:: !(!p | q) | r\\).\n   - By De Morgan's Law from rule (6), this is \\((!!p & !q) | r\\).\n   - Simplifying further using basic equivalence rule (1), this becomes \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\n2. Moving to \\(q>r\\), this also converts by rule (10) to \\(!q | r\\).\n   - Thus, \\(p>(q>r)\\) becomes \\(p>(!q | r)\\).\n   - Again, by rule (10), we get \\(p>(!q | r) \\equiv:: !p | (!q | r)\\).\n   - This simplifies directly to \\( !p | (!q | r)\\), and applying the associative property (rule (4)), it becomes \\((!p | !q) | r\\).\n\n3. Now let\u2019s compare the final forms of the two propositions:\n   - \\((p>q)>r\\) is \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n   - \\(p>(q>r)\\) is \\((!p | !q) | r\\).\n\nThese two propositions are not structurally identical and thus, cannot be translated into one another using the provided rules. \\( (p & !q) \\) is not the same as \\( (!p | !q) \\), as one expresses a conjunction while the other expresses a disjunction of negations.\n\nAccording to this analysis, \\((p>q)>r\\) and \\(p>(q>r)\\) are **not** equivalent, so the correct response is:\n\n[[B]]"}

(p\u2228r)\n2. (\u00acq\u2228r)\n3. (\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Disjunctive Terms\nEach clause must be made exclusive by considering the other variables' true/false states, ensuring each term is a paired conjunctive term.\n- In (p\u2228r), possible satisfied assignments are: pq\u00acr (101), p\u00acq\u00acr (100), pqr (111), and so forth, covering terms where either p or r is true.\n- In (\u00acq\u2228r), possible satisfied assignments are: p\u00acqr (110), p\u00acq\u00acr (100), \u00acp\u00acqr (010), and so forth, covering terms where either q is false or r is true.\n- In (\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr), all combinations where not all literals are false (\u00acp, q, \u00acr specifically).\n\n### Step 3: Combined Term Truth Assignments\nFor the formula to be in principal disjunctive normal form, each conjunctive term in a complete disjunctive form must involve every possible combination of variables in either their normal or negated states once. However, from the formula's structure, not all combinations are represented; for example, combined terms need to allow for every possible value assignment to p, q, r to be accounted for in the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nGiven the distinct clauses do not cover absolutely every possible pairing of p, q, r (e.g., \u00acp\u00acq\u00acr not directly represented unless deduced through complex Boolean algebra), we find:\n\n### Conclusion\nThe formula cannot be exactly framed into either a principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form as it doesn\u2019t include all exclusive possible assignments of variables p, q, and r (all 2^n combinations of the variables) distinctly. Each term isn't neatly a paired conjunctive term given overlaps and missing explicit representations of some states.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nIf Li Gua murdered his boss, then he is an evil person. Li Gua did not murder his boss, so Li Gua is not an evil person. This reasoning is obviously unsound. The act of murder (regardless of whether it is the boss) can indeed make a person an evildoer, but evildoers are not limited to murderers; there are many other forms of wrongdoing. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that \"Li Gua is not an evil person\" from \"Li Gua did not murder someone.\"\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC.
