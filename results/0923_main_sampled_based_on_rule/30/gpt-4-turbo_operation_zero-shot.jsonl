Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na◎b=(a + bi)^2\n\n### Question:\nCompute (4◎5)+(2◎3).\nIf the answer is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First compute 4◎5 using the operation rule \\(a◎b=(a + bi)^2\\):\n\n\\(4◎5 = (4 + 5i)^2\\)\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[ \n(4 + 5i)^2 = 4^2 + 2(4)(5i) + (5i)^2 \n= 16 + 40i + 25i^2\n\\]\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\),\n\\[ \n25i^2 = 25(-1) = -25\n\\]\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\\[ \n16 + 40i - 25 = -9 + 40i\n\\]\n\nNow compute 2◎3:\n\\[ \n2◎3 = (2 + 3i)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\\[ \n(2 + 3i)^2 = 2^2 + 2(2)(3i) + (3i)^2 \n= 4 + 12i + 9i^2 \n\\]\nAgain, using \\(i^2 = -1\\),\n\\[ \n9i^2 = 9(-1) = -9\n\\]\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\\[ \n4 + 12i - 9 = -5 + 12i\n\\]\n\nAdding the results of \\(4◎5\\) and \\(2◎3\\):\n\\[\n(-9 + 40i) + (-5 + 12i) = -9 - 5 + 40i + 12i = -14 + 52i\n\\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\\[[[-14 + 52i]]]"}
