For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)V(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)V(p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(p\u2227q\u2227r) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given formula conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form, we first need to identify the paired conjunctive terms included in the formula:\n\n1. The formula is in disjunctive form with terms:\n   - \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr\n   - \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r\n   - \u00acp\u2227q\u2227r\n   - p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r\n   - p\u2227q\u2227r\n\n2. Convert each term to binary and find the corresponding decimal (then hexadecimal) indices:\n   - \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr: Binary 000, Hexadecimal 0\n   - \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r: Binary 001, Hexadecimal 1\n   - \u00acp\u2227q\u2227r: Binary 011, Hexadecimal 3\n   - p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r: Binary 101, Hexadecimal 5\n   - p\u2227q\u2227r: Binary 111, Hexadecimal 7\n\n3. The indices from hexadecimal form are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7.\n\nAccording to the rule, for a principal disjunctive normal form, the formula should include paired conjunctive terms.\n\n- Denoted expression: m0 \u2228 m1 \u2228 m3 \u2228 m5 \u2228 m7\n\nSince the provided formula includes paired conjunctive terms, it conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form. \n\nThus, the formal notation for the conformance to the principal disjunctive normal form is:\n\\[ [(p\u2227q\u2227r)]; [m0 \u2228 m1 \u2228 m3 \u2228 m5 \u2228 m7] \\]"}

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r)? How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this, we need to analyze the disjunctive normal form of the given expression: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Propositional Variables and Negations:**\n   - The variables involved are \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\).\n   - The expression uses both negations and conjunctions.\n\n2. **Expand into Disjunctive Normal Form:**\n   - The given expression is already in disjunctive form: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\).\n\n3. **Analyze Each Conjunctive Term:**\n   - **First term:** \\(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r\\)\n     - True assignment: \\(\\{p = 0, q = 0, r = 1\\}\\)\n     - Binary: \\(001\\), corresponding to decimal \\(1\\), hexadecimal \\(1\\).\n     - Denoted as \\(m1\\).\n\n   - **Second term:** \\(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r\\)\n     - True assignment: \\(\\{p = 0, q = 1, r = 1\\}\\)\n     - Binary: \\(011\\), corresponding to decimal \\(3\\), hexadecimal \\(3\\).\n     - Denoted as \\(m3\\).\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Paired conjunctive terms are \\(m1\\) and \\(m3\\).\n\n### Final Notation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{[[paired conjunctive terms: \\(m1, m3\\)]; [denoted: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\)]]}\n\\]"}
