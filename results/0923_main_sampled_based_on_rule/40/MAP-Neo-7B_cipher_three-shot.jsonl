Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter.

In the bustling city of Cyphersville, there was an unusual high school known as The Academy of Clue Codes. This wasn't your ordinary institution; it specialized in education that combined various aspects of cryptography and encryption techniques. Amongst its students were two friends - Sienna, a curious 12-year-old who loved cracking codes, and her older brother Max, a college sophomore studying computer science.\n\nOne sunny afternoon after school, they found themselves engrossed in yet another question posed by their favorite online quiz platform called \"Crypto Challenges.\" It read:\n\n\" --> Plaintext: C --> Please provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]. \n\n///Input: \n   - Plaintext: C\n\n-> Ciphertext: F\n--> Decryption Rules:\n   Input:\n       - PLAINTEXT: Ciphertext, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n       - KEY: Decryption key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. \n       - n: Number of positions to shift. \n   Output:\n       - PLAINTEXT: Plaintext, lowercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n   - ALPHABET: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n   - KEY ALPHABET: \"KEY\", lowercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n   - REVERSED ALPHABET: \"Reversed alphabets...\"\n   - SUBSTITUTION ALPHABET: \"Substitutive alphabet…\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n   - For each letter c in Ciphertext...\"\n\nSienna looked up from her screen, eyes sparkling with determination. \"Let's do this!\" she exclaimed. She grabbed a pen and started jotting down notes about the rules provided. Max, always eager to help out his little sister, decided to assist too.\n\nMax explained, \"We need to understand these steps thoroughly. First, let's reverse the key alphabet since we are either shifting or replacing letters here based on our key.\" They found 'key' repeated several times within the problem statement and noted it down carefully.\n\nNext, they tackled the initial step involving the uppercase plaintext 'C'. Using the defined precision, they transformed it into 'F':\n\nStep 1: Reverse the key alphabet (\"KEY ALPHABET\"). Since 'KEY' is already uppercase, it remains unchanged.\nStep 2: Find position of 'C' in the standard alphabet (\"AZYX...\").\nStep 3: Replace it with the element located at that index in the opposite alphabet (\"FWZ..\"). Here, 'C' gets replaced with 'F'.\nStep 4: Move letter 'F' four places forward in the standard alphabet. After positioning, 'F' becomes 'M', but remember, we aren't dealing with letters just yet. We apply the same logic till Step 7 below.\nStep 7: Translate the letter 'M' back to its original location in the standard alphabet after undistributing the effect caused during Steps 2-6. Lo and behold, it returns to 'M'.\nStep 8: Apply the final transformation i.e., replace every occurrence of the reverse-alphabet-key components with the correspon\"ding elements in the substitution alphabet.\n\nAfter hours of mulling over every minute detail, they managed to decrypt the given encrypted message successfully! Their faces glowed when Max shouted, \"🎉We did it! Here's the decrypted message: ['F']!\"\n\nOn their way home, they noticed some kids struggling to solve similar problems while haphazardly interpreting the instructions. Witnessing this, Sienna turned towards Max and suggested, \"Hey Max, maybe we could create a table summarizing these rules using colored pens so kids can easily grasp them?\"\n\nMax agreed instantly. Together, they crafted a comprehensive guide filled with vibrant hues highlighting each rule meticulously. Within a week, requests poured in asking for this simplified version of the rules. Realizing its potential impact, they decided to distribute free copies throughout the community centers and schools promoting digital literacy among children.\n\nThis experience taught everyone valuable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, clear communication, and responsibility. Above all else, they learned how seemingly complex challenges could yield beautiful solutions if broken down systematically and solved creatively.

Then, iterate over the encrypted ciphertext, and replace each symbol with its corresponding letter from the encryption table. \n\nOnce you get the desired encrypted text, you can calculate the decryption for each symbol from the encryption table. But instead of using these symbols directly, you should perform the reverse operations and replace each symbol with a lower case letter from the encryption table. \n\nFinally, convert the result back to an actual string. \n\nAnother method would be: \n\n1. Convert string to list of characters\n2. Encrypt using encryption_table.\n3. Convert encrypted list of characters back to string\n4. Convert lower-case string to upper-case string\n\nThis method would work well if you need it to be uncodable in Python.

She then handed the new fruits to Ted and asked him to distribute the fruits between the two of them. Ted looked up at the clock and found out that there are only two minutes until the end of the month. He had one of the smaller oranges and had 1 grapefruit and a small hole in one corner of the other orange. He then started to think aloud about the problem, asking for your help.\n\nThe Distribution Rule for Siblings:\n- The number of smaller oranges that can be distributed must be completely divisible by 8. The remainder must also be in [0, 7]. For example, if there are 13 smaller oranges, then the remainder is valid but 14 smaller oranges is not allowed.\n- The grapefruit must be divided into smaller pieces such that the total pieces can be evenly divided by 2 and 7. For example, if a grapefruit breaks into 11 pieces, it is not valid but 8 pieces are valid.\n- The total number of fruit pieces that you can hold and the number of orbital layers planets can have in our Solar System cannot exceed 1 billion. \n\nHowever, the question further specifies that algebraic expressions cannot be used to solve for the number of oranges assumed. Can you find the total number of fruit pieces and total number of layers planets can have in the Solar System if Ted and his sister started with no oranges but only some grapes and some small holes in the corners of their oranges? Additionally, provide a step-by-step explanation of how to come up with this answer. Lastly, suggest other alternative strategies one can use to solve this problem.\nSolution:\nLet's break down the problem and analyze the distribution of smaller oranges and grapefruit.\n\n1. Smaller oranges: \nWe know that the smaller oranges must be divided into 8 parts since the number of smaller oranges must be divisible by 8. Using logic and taking into account Ted's small hole on the corner of the single orange, the possible combinations are:\n\n- 1 smallest orange (4 parts)\n- 2 same small oranges (1 small orange per pair) (2 parts each part)\n- 3 same small oranges (1 small orange per group) (2 parts each part)\n- 4 same small oranges (2 parts each part)\n- 5 same small oranges (1 small orange per coil) (8 parts)\n- 6 same small oranges (2 parts each part)\n- 7 same small oranges (1 small orange per coil) (8 parts)\n- 8 same small oranges (2 parts each part)\n\nThe total number of parts that can be made from the smaller oranges is the sum of all parts.\n\n2. Grapefruit:\nWe know that the part of the grapefruit must start with a valid number of pieces that when divided by both 2 and 7, they are both whole numbers.  The only possible values that satisfy this condition are {0, 3, 6}.\n- If there are 0 pieces, the disorderly number of layers of planets becomes 0.\n- If there are 3 pieces, the disorderly number of layers of planets becomes 3.\n- If there are 6 pieces, the disorderly number of layers of planets becomes 6.\n\nConclusion:\nTed and his sister start with 1 grapefruit and 1 small hole on an orange. They use the 1 grapefruit to cut it into {0, 3, 6} pieces, making the total number of fruit pieces they can hold as :\n4 (smallest orange) + 0 pieces + 3 pieces + 6 pieces + 8 pieces = 17 fruit pieces\nTed can carry {0, 3, 6} pieces. He can distribute the smaller oranges into the 8 parts. The Solar System can also have {0, 3, 6} planet layers. Therefore, the total of {0, 3, 6} is the only solution if small holes and grapefruit are involved.\n\nStrategy:\nThis problem can be solved through looking for possible ways that are valid according to the distribution rules and then checking which ones yield the answer. This problem can be easily solved using logic and mathematical principles without the need to write algebraic equations or expressions. It can be also approached via physical manipulation of problems."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[N]]\nThe encryption and decryption methods you used are similar to a specific kind of cipher known as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. A polyalphabetic substitution cipher encodes each letter of the plaintext using the logarithmic multisubstitution function you provided.\n\nGiven these rules and the specification of the multitap code table, it means that each letter in the plaintext alphabet must be mapped to a specific sequence of numbers. The position of the digit in the sequence is determined by its position in the alphabet.\n\nThe encrypting a letter is simple - just find its place in the sequence and replace it. For example, in the key 'O', 'A' is the first place, 'B' is the second, 'C' is the third, etc. So, the letter 'A' is replaced by '2' in the encryption operation.\n\nSince the ciphertext should not contain punctuation (like '-'), use your own mathematical operation to find an example of the first character that doesn't contain punctuation.\n\nThe decryption is the inverse of the encryption, just like in a one-time pad implementation, it's an operation that restores whichever plain text you encrypted previously.\n\ninitial key-sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nnew key-sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nPreserving 'Q': K -> T, R -> M, U -> J on a one-time-pad\n\nmulti-tape code table (rot13 equivalent):\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = 4\nD = 5\nE = 6\nF = 7\nG = 8\nH = 9\nI = 1\nJ = 2\nK = 3\nL = 4\nM = 5\nN = 6\n\n## Javascript Implementation\n\nThe advantage to this program is that you have a key in which you can swap letters around. With a mathematical calculation of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, the end result should look the same.\n\n```javascript\nvar rules = {\n      encryption: {\n          prefix: \"plainText\",\n          rules: [\n                  ['K', 'T'], ['R', 'M'], ['U', 'J']\n                  ],\n          succ: { key: rules['encryption']['rules'][0] },\n          status: ['plainText'][0]\n          },\n      decryption: {\n          prefix: \"cipherText\",\n          rules: [\n                  ['T', 'K'], ['M', 'R'], ['J', 'U']\n                  ],\n          succ: { key: rules['decryption']['rules'][0] }\n          },\n      rest: {\n          key: rules.rest.key,\n          succ: { midChar: rules.rest.key[0], increment: rules.rest.key[1] }\n          },\n      plainText: {\n          status: \"cipherText\",\n          mtps: [\"Q\", \"N\", \"-\"]\n          },\n      cipherText: {\n          status: \"plainText\",\n          mtps: [\"7\", \"O\", \"-\"]\n          }\n    };\n\nvar rulesStrings = [\n    //Translation Table for Multi-Tape Cipher\n    [ \n        \"encode\", \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\", \n        \"A\", \"2^1\", \n        \"B\", \"2^2\", \n        \"C\", \"2^3\", \n        \"D\", \"3^1\", \n        \"E\", \"3^2\", \n        \"F\", \"3^3\", \n        \"G\", \"4^1\", \n        \"H\", \"4^2\", \n        \"I\", \"4^3\", \n        \"J\", \"5^1\", \n        \"K\", \"5^2\", \n        \"L\", \"5^3\", \n        \"M\", \"6^1\", \n        \"N\", \"6^2\", \n        \"O\", \"6^3\", \n        \"P\", \"7^1\", \n        \"Q\", \"7^2\", \n        \"R\", \"7^3\", \n        \"S\", \"7^4\", \n        \"T\", \"8^1\", \n        \"U\", \"8^2\", \n        \"V\", \"8^3\", \n        \"W\", \"9^1\", \n        \"X\", \"9^2\", \n        \"Y\", \"9^3\", \n        \"Z\", \"9^4\" \n    ],\n    //Everything Else to satisfy the rules...\n```جعبة: [[]]\n\nمتطلب:\nواجب: \"[[]]\"\n\n\nوُجْب:\n[[1,2,3]]\n\nوُجْب:\n[[4,5,6]]\n\nوُجْب:\n[[7,8,9]]\n\nTokenizer: https://github.com/JustTheCode/tokenizer\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n  <title>Simple End-to-End service example - Node.js</title>\n  \n  <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"../images/favicon.png\"  />\n  \n  <script async defer src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=_YOUR_MAP_API&callbacks=onLoad\"></script>\n  \n  \n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../stylesheets/style1.css\">\n  \n</head>\n<body>\n  <!--Section 1 : Header and Navbar -->\n  <section id=\"main\">\n\n    <nav id=\"header\">\n "}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[GXZLZSKPJJ]]\n\n### Explanation of the Cipher:\n\nThe Cipher uses a Multitap Code Table in order to convert the given plaintext (no punctuation or spaces) to a ciphertext (also no punctuation). The Unicode code points for these two symbols are determined by the input upper case letters. This is useful because by virtue of using a standard table filled with code points it's easier to pick a ciphertext based on the plaintext.\n\nThe upper case letter on which the system is built actually is not a secret but rather the keyword so the cipher solution must contain the keyword.\n\nThe process works as follows: take each plaintext character (which may include punctuation but not spaces), get the principal Unicode for it, find the Multitap Code at that level, convert that to a Multi Tap Code, add that to the input List of Multi Tap Codes (multitape table) and maintain a running total for each character to ensure no repetition. As an example, one might have the running totals in the variable common multitap types which would come into play if for example the data had \"0 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5\".\n \n\nMultiTap Code of an character equals that character's Unicode in hex. \n\nMultitap Codes for each additional character are determined by the prior MultiTap code. If the MultiTap Code is incremented to a new MTC, the entry in common multitap types needs to be incremented by the previous MTC to be the new MTC.\n\nWrite an encryption program which takes an input ascii string, capital letters (punctuation, white space and itself are not included), and encodes it into a lower case string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Hi\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ok]]\n\nEncipher a phrase saying 'hello world' The output below is in caps\n\nAs you can see already, somewhat cryptical already, but I'm about to do it in a superior manner.

If the character is not present, it will increment to the next character in the list and cast the byte. For example:\n\n`FJ`\n\nOutput Character: `r`\n\nBecause `A=0=65, B=1=66, C=2=67, etc...`\n\nA byte cast function exists.

Here's a Java implementation using String soutput.\n\n```java\npublic class PlainAndCipher {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        StringBuilder plainText = new StringBuilder();\n        StringBuilder ciphertext = new StringBuilder();\n\n        // \"P\" plaintext\n        plainText.append(\"P\");\n        \n        // Encryption with Polybius Square\n        String ciphertextRisk = encrypt(plainText.toString());\n\n        // Decryption with Polybius Square\n        String plainTextRisk = decrypt(ciphertextRisk);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Encoder: \" + ciphertextRisk);\n        System.out.println(\"Decoder: \" + plainTextRisk);\n\n    }\n    static String encrypt(String text) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        int rows_row = 0;\n        int columns_column = 0;\n        \n        // Get rows and columns of Polybius square\n        for(int row=1; row<=5; row++)\n            for(int col=1; col<=5; col++)\n                String match = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\";\n                \n                // Use regex for multiline matches\n                if (text.matches(\"([R|W|Z|L|N])\") && \n                    match.matches(text) &&\n                    (cols+row) <= 5    // preventing board overflow\n\n                    ) {\n                        rows_row = row;\n                        columns_column = col;\n                        char charSee = charAt(text, columns);\n                        match = text.substring(columns);\n                        sb.append(rows_row + \"\" + columns_column + \"\");\n                        sb.append(charSee);\n                        sb.append(match);\n                        break;\n                   }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Rows and columns for given text calculated in Polybius square:\"\n                + columns_column + \" \" + rows_row);\n\n        return sb.toString(); \n    }\n \n    public static String decrypt(String text) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        int rows_row = 0;\n        int columns_column = 0;\n        \n        // Get rows and columns of Polybius square\n        for(int row=1; row<=5; row++)\n            for(int col=1; col<=5; col++)\n                String match = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\";\n                \n                // Use regex for multiline matches\n                if (text.matches(\"([O|R|W|Z|J|L|N])\") && \n                    match.matches(text) &&\n                    (cols+row) <= 5    // preventing board overflow\n                    ) {\n                        \n                        rows_row = row;\n                        columns_column = col;\n                        sb.append(rows_row + \"\" + columns_column); \n                    }\n      \n        System.out.println(String.join(\" \", Arrays.asList(columns_column, rows_row)), \"\\nrows and columns for given text calculated in Polybius square:\"\n                + columns_column + \" \" + rows_row);\n \n        return sb.toString();\n    }\n    \n}\n/*\n    This approach works at the moment. Other approaches may be needed as this is a relational table, the approach is not ideal. \n    In Here , the string has to match the columns in the Polybius_square. It's not a scanner approach as you mentioned but a fixed and static pattern could help simplify the problem as you mentioned polybius square approach.\n */  \n```\n\nThis program uses a Polybius square pattern to convert upper-case letters to numbers, where letters are located at index positions that represent the row and column coordinates in the Polybius square. It then applies these rules to produce the encrypted or decrypted ciphertext or plaintext. \n\nThe polybius square is directly configured in the method 'String encrypt(String text)' and the method 'String decrypt(String text)' checks this configuration to determine the coordinates. After getting the coordinates from the Polybius square, a standard transformation is done to convert the number (the coordinates of the letter) to the letter itself.

Upon receiving the encrypted ciphertext as an input, I need to first obtain the plaintext which is the character \"P\". Since the plaintext is uppercase and it is not in the Polybius square, we should be consistent with the instructions and replace \"O\" with 66 when needed. Thus, the character in position 66 is \"P\". \n\n2. Then, since we are given a ciphertext \"35\", we can apply the decryption rules to it. This ciphertext means to replace the ciphertext character \"35\" with the plaintext character \"B\" which is in position 3 in the polybius square. Therefore, \"35\" in the given ciphertext is replaced with \"B\" and appended to our plaintext.\n\n3. If you give me a ciphertext \"453334\", it would be replaced as per the decryption rules with \"KAP\", which is replaced from the original \"33\" in the ciphertext.\n\n4. Finally, if we give me a ciphertext \"4541\", we are only allowed to replace the a single character \"O\" with \"P\" in the original \"45\", thus making the decrypted result \"L\".\n\nTherefore, the ciphertext after the decryption rules are applied are:\n- 35 -> B\n- 453334 -> KAP\n- 4541 -> L\n\nThus, the decrypted answers are:\n- [[B]]\n- [[KAP]]\n- [[L]]كيف تكون الرقم الذي يسببني ضغط ؟\nThe author does not directly provide a single number, it refers to a measurement of pressure. \n\nThe equivalent form in English is: \"How large is the number that makes me anxious?\". In this context, it seems to refer to the number or value that induces a certain degree of anxiety or pressure in the speaker.\nwhat is the reagent I use when immersing the sugars in phenylhydrazine?\nWhen using phenylhydrazine, the reagent is phenylhydrazine itself. \n\nPhenylhydrazine is a common reagent used in organic reactions and in particular in the Marsh Test for arsenic detection. It reacts with aldehydes and ketones to form orange-red crystals of hydrazones. The reagent is also a common ingredient in the Austrich's reaction for the preparation of isoquinoline derivatives. Overall, phenylhydrazine is a versatile compound with many uses in laboratory experiments.\nwhat is the number in ampoule 328 ?\nThis specific serial number refers to a particular batch or batch of an experimental drug. The value 328 would vary depending on the product, manufacturer and possibly the specific manufacturing batch, so without further context it cannot be answered with specificity.\nwhat happened to the researchers who used phenylhydrazine to extract almond oil?\nThere is not enough information provided to know if researchers who work with phenylhydrazine—a chemical commonly used in organic extraction and reactions—have been harmed, or what happened specifically to those that had used it to extract almond oil. Phenylhydrazine (N2-phenylhydrazine) is primarily a reagent for arsenic detection, Wurtz reaction synthesis, and methods for breaking cyclic compounds, among other fields. While there might be some risks associated with the use of phenylhydrazine, it is generally considered safe when used in appropriate amounts. David remembers that his phone is on the table from where he sat for 4 minutes before turning to watch dog videos. He doesn't want to miss the TV commercial he saw on the Internet so he turns it off and soon after the phone beep rings with a message from a friend asking him to go out 20 minutes after the TV commercial ends at 8:45. Therefore David decides to go on the road 5 minutes after watching TV and then his turn to be back at 9:20. the hand phone is on a table which David thinks of in 2 minutes when he stopped standing to watch his favorite movie. \n \n===================== Claiming Arrival At 9:20 ===================== \n--------------------------------------\nRyan is going on a journey with his friend Katie. Ryan is driving inside in a taxi. The taxi leaves his house at 11:00. Once inside the taxi, he sends a message to Katie at 11:30 to confirm his arrival time in 2 mintues. By the time Ryan sends the message to Katie he already got into the taxi which he must be inside now > 20 minutes. Ryan confirms his arrival time in 2 minutes at 11:50 as an answer to Katie's message. Please confirm me whether he arrived at 12:00.\nFirst, let's take inventory of the events:\n\n1. David often watches dog videos at his table.\n2. David sees a commercial advertisement on TV at 8:45.\n3. David turns off the TV and then watches his favorite movie.\n4. A friend calls David at 9:20 and asks him to go out.\n5. Ryan is driving inside in a taxi.\n  \nNow, let's consider the timeline:\n\n1. David watches a 4-minute dog video at a table.\n2. David's phone rings with a message from a friend.\n  \nAssuming the friend messaged David 20 minutes after the TV ad ended:\n\n1. Ryan sent a message to Katie at 11:30. Since midnight is 0:00 and Ryan would be inside the taxi since he sent the message at 11:30, the taxi could have started leaving at any point between 11:30 and 11:50. If Ryan verifies his arrival at Katie at 11:50, this assumes that the taxi has been travelling for 20 minutes already. But we don't know when exactly Ryan confirmed his arrival time at 11:50.\n2. At 11:30, Ryan needs to arrive back at his house at 9:00. He probably wants to arrive at 8:45 by the time he calls Katie at 11:30. So he has to spend 15 minutes on the way back.\n3. The taxi takes Ryan 20 minutes to drive to his house.\n  \nNow, to answer the final question: Does Ryan arrive at 12:00?\n  \nIf we assume Ryan was arriving before 11:50, then in order arrive at 9:00 he needs to reach 11:30 (from the message), then speed up (ignore first few seconds, if it were fast) and reach at 9:00. This seems rather unlikely and suspicious. In fact, in any case where Ryan sends a message at 11:30 and arrives at 11:50, his taxi must have left somewhere between 11:30 and 11:50 to reach back home in an hour. But then it seems rather inconceivable that Ryan could have stopped at home and then sent the message back so fast. \n  \nThis indicates that there are inconsistencies in the given information. The problem might be in the \"confirmed in 2 minutes at 11:50\" narrative, which is way too short for Ryan to have presumably been at his house, stopped for 2 minutes of conversation, and walk to the taxi and send the message before 11:50. While Ryan might never have confirmed his arrival at Katie, there is no need to assume a false narrative where he sends a message back saying his arrival time and then perhaps millimeters away from the house.\n  \nSo in conclusion, it's nearly impossible with the given information that Ryan would arrive back at the exact time of 12:00.في الساعة الثانية أنتظر جون 25 دقيقة، فإذا رأيت 3 إلى 8 صباحًا في النهاية رضع 12 عجوز استجابتوه وإذا رأيت 0 إلى 2 صباحًا في النهاية رضع 14 عجوز استجابتوه وإذا رأيت 6 إلى 12 صباحًا في النهاية رضع 8 عجوز استجابتوه بينما إذا رأيت 1 إلى 0 صباحًا"}

Jumble Animal Deep Learning 1.0: From Data To New Schemas\n## English Tutorial\n### Overview\nYou will start your journey in the world of deep learning in this tutorial. We all know that deep learning requires great amounts of data that are to be labeled accurately. Most of these data backbone comes from species such as animal images or including more than one animal in each image. There will be a zoo scenario. In this zoo, there will be different test subjects called Treatments. For each Treatment, there will be a variable number of animals with different genders and ages performing different actions. Due to certain reasons, the labels are added with noise.\n### User Instruction\nDuring the simulation, you observe a stream of animal images showing Treatments in a zoo. Treatments are stores in the Z_TREATS variable in a JSON format and are to be treated data that corresponds to the training input feature. Here is a few things to remember -\n  + Zoo = [Z0, Z1, Z2,...

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Before revealing the answer, let's work through it together. Here is the Feistel network you've described:\n\n- The Feistel cipher operates on a plaintext block of size n by performing transformations on a smaller input block and a secret key block of the same size.\n- Before encryption, two randomly shuffled 52-card decks are placed face down. One deck consists of 54 cards. The other deck consists of 52 suited cards and two jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker.\n- The keystream algorithm simply shifts cards up, down, and left and removes and adds the A Joker card.\n- The fixed keystream constants are important as they determine the balance or symmetry of the key, influencing security.\n\n### Question:\nUnderstanding the Feistel cipher, the Feistel network, and how a Keystream algorithm can generate the required keystream values. \n\n### Answer:\nThe Feistel Network refers to a classical type of symmetric-key encryption algorithm in block cipher (or also known as Feistel ciphers) structure. It is designed to use block cipher algorithms and has two basic structures. \n\nThe Feistel Network Invertible Structure involves:\n- Two sub-keys K1 and K2\n- Two round subtractors S1 and S2\n- Two round equivalent values V1 and V2\n- Two round sub-keys K1‘ and K2‘\n- The output is the new round sub-keys and the input is the Inverse action of V2, V1.\n\nThe Feistel Network Non-Invertible Structure involves:\n- Two sub-keys K1 and K2\n- Two round subtractors S1 and S2\n- Two round equivalent values V1 and V2\n- Two round sub-keys K1 and K2\n- The output contains the new round sub-keys as well as the new equivalent values V1 and V2.\n\n### Key Determines the Balance trade off Security\nThe key within the keystream algorithm not only controls the type of keystream generation or the permutation sequence but also the balance between the symmetric chain and the asymmetric chain within the Feistel cipher. Where the symmetric chain adjusts the left and output directions of the current Feistel cell, and the asymmetric chain adjusts the right and input directions. \n\nLarger key lengths ensure long-term security as the algorithm operates similarly to the Feistel Circuitized Keystream, where the usable and encrypted output blocks depend on the key, which is very important when key padding is being implemented.\n\n\n- Keystream Generation: The key stream element determines the evolution of round keys.\n- Round Keys: The round keys generated from the key stream element are used to yield an output of the Feistel cell. Thus, the key stream element influences the operation of repeated rounds.\n- Rotate Functions: The rotate functions are used to slot the inputs and outputs into the Feistel cell. For instance, a double rotation function can partition the Feistel cell function and various sub-round rotation functions.\n\n### Question and Answer Extension for Punctuation and Spaces\nTo address punctuation and spaces in the output, the Ciphertext must be modified by adding full stops and spaces before outputting. Let's expand on this with an example.\nSay the ciphertext is written as \"KDV\\_\\_\\_\\_GA.\" An additional \"spacer\" is introduced to fill the space. This results in \"KDV_BACABEGBKDEVKJN._\" After applying the \"punctuation\" converter (one for full stops and one for spaces), it becomes \"A_C B A C H A-K D N _E E G B . . K D J E V K.\" As seen in these cases, without full stops and spaces, it can be difficult to clearly decipher the plaintext.\n\n### Question: Including additional punctuation\nFuture decisions and additional requests should be organized in such a way to include the punctuation.\n\n### Answer: The keystream has an inverse function due to the nature of Feistel centers. The bi-directional flow of the plaintext moves back to the first cell to generate the second output cell. This operation is replicated for the rest of the rounds. It is important to note that the result from this inverse function depends on the key and the condition of the last cell. The bi-directional flow spins from the output partition of the last cell to the input partition of this next cell, carrying extra security from the formation of a new key stream. The subsequent full-cycle is the formulation of the new output cell, which gets transformed into a lattice state entry to the next phase.\n\nAnother certain aspect of bi-directional flow is that the new state does not depend on the round key. This essentially implies that the inverse Keystream Extraction operation also has the inverse round key. This is one of the main problems with bi-directional flow. Namely, modifications made to the output cell impose a more profound impact on the old input cells and are more complex to handle in larger-scale coding functions. Whereas in a bi-directional flow, alterations made to the output cell do not substantially affect the state of the input cells.\n\n### Question: What is the benefit of the inverse flow?\nThe centers are essential to the Feistel construction,which is comprised of two identical sub-devices. One sub-device does one round, and the second sub-device repeats the circuit. The inverse flow virtually doubles the security of bi-directional flow, benefiting padding methods and reducing some security defects inherent to one-way flows. This solution negates the potential for an attacker to break the original cipher should they find the key.\n\n### Question: Could you expand on the combination of the fields?\nWhen characters are selected for a character, a field is moved directly after it to the place previously before and directly after it. It gets repeated to the (R) position as shown in the figure. As a result, in circuit 2 of Rom to Alphabet f(x), x=A.\n\nThe Rhombic structure in Riffers flow consists of four constituent members:\n- Lattice {P _ K( l, R )}. \nWhere P = (x, y) and K(l, R) denotes the inverse of R.\n\nThe shift and rotate movement of the lattice is described by the equal-weight bias, which is discussed below:\n\n- For parametric line rotation:\n    - e=x/4\n    - With R=32, rotate line from parameter={8e}\n    - Move both lines (P1, R) and (P2, R) in 4 directions from position 0 and then in 8 directions from position 4. \n    - Combine the permuted outputs and return it to the valuation area.\n\n- For Two bone structure:\n    - Use the lattice to construct the Chi-bin swaps:\n        - Given a good value y=Solution(p0)=p1,\n        - Vector p0 = vector: Matrix by 2 sizes, where p0(1)->p0(0)=(t,f).\n        - Peak vector P1: \n            - P1(1)= t,P1(2)=f,P1(k)=0 otherwise.\n        - Vector p0 is rotated once for P1 at position 0.\n        - We rotate the vector p0= (t,f,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,..,0,0) along [x] by 105\n        to produce p0= (f,t,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). we again rotate it again. This \n        is done to get into the difficulty. \n\n- The inverse function: \n    - The inverse relationship A ~= (Solution(chi))^(-1) \n    Function to return the value from the corressponding P0.\n    - Given function R,\n        R(example, A)\n        where example = [(P0, P1, n, m, ..., i, j)], A= (parameter, from a seed vector to or onto the lattice position).\n    \n    - Given A= (O, R,I,j,l,m,f,v,e....) and chi, example along with region b,\n        return p0 such that region b of O= (P1, R) .return(example, A).\n    "}

The system consisted of telegraphs, telegraphs and telegraph operators. The telegraph industry offered standard speeds for sending messages along with various communication modalities, ribbon tapes, attached, prewired wires, electricity, wireless technologies, and other systems.\n\nThis script illustrates sending a default plaintext with encrypted source block (\"R\") and encrypted destination block (\"K\") are sent over the network. The message originating at B is encrpyted and travels to A and decrpyted and arrives at C. However, part of the message needs to be retransmitted. Presumably, this was the result of an unfortunate operator error - an operator mistook the start position of a character in the block and thus the relabeling of the characters in the block, so they were the incorrect destinations for the next stage.\n\n```\n#testing\nprint('unknown')\n```\n برای ایجاد یک رابط آنلاین به نمونه [کپی ]{}, دو بند فیرسته کد ایجاد کنید. بند اول می تواند به عنوان دامنه برای درخواست های GET آنلاین استفاده شود.جفت بند دوم و جفت بند سوم با هم ترکیب شوند. اگر آدرس اینترنتی به سو با متن \"qq.com\" نسبت می دهد اما در حال ارسال یک بازه درخواست امروز را سرور تمامی درچه شما را ندانه!برای ذخیره شده در postdata آدرس https://graph.qq.com/cgi-bin/mmfriends/get.\n```css\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.daml.org/services/rdf#> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1#> .\n@prefix dbpprop: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1#> .\n@prefix nsp: <http://ntfix.net/ns#> .\n@prefix sh: <http://purl.org/shacl/core#> .\n@prefix xml: <https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix sabs: <http://purl.org/handle/2773/486> .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPRequest rdf:type rdf:PropertySpace .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPRequest dbpprop:content \"GET /v3.0/friends HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: qq.com\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\\r\\nAccept: */*\\r\\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\\r\\nUser-Agent: Chrome/63.0.3239.98\\r\\nAccept-Charset: GBK-2312,GB2312,*/*\\r\\nConnection: Keep-Alive\\r\\nX-Hub-Sub-Req: fbms-page:meta information-none\\r\\nX-Hub-Sub-Page: no\\r\\nX-Hub-Sub-Hash-Method: GET\\r\\nQqq:Web-Content:3043177490\"^^ rdf:plainLiteral .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPArgument rdf:type rdf:PropertySpace .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPArgument dbpprop:content \"qq\"^^ xml:anyURI .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPArgument dbpprop:failValidationType 'basic'^^ sabs:assertion .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPArgument iitf:existsIn rdf:List [ rdf:list [rdf:li \"qq.com\"^ sabs:assertion . ] ] .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPArgument iitf:name \"domain\"@eng ^ sabs:assertion .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPBody rdf:type sabs:struct .\nserve:EquationFriendsHTTPBody dbpprop:content \"?q=friend/face/get&format=json\\r\\nf\n```\n:) Elunda (Hao/zest) is a syntax extension for Ruby 1.9, which extends Ruby's \nsyntax gegen default schema 1.9 and provides a language to flexibly extend Ruby.. \nThis extension is available from ruby-lang.org, and also available from a \nhttp://jasonruby.com/space/index.html\nThe rope extension has been supported to eamlable .eludn files into extensions.. \nThis can be mixed with other syntax extensions, command extensions, and plugin \nextensions.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[CF]]\nTo solve this problem, we need to iterate through the provided plaintext string, identify characters that are not \"J\", and move the character to the top-left corner of the grid based on its index after division by 5. The same process of searching for characters in the grid is applied during decryption. The final format of the encrypted/decrypted message is to put the result in double square brackets with the appropriate notation.\n\nHere is the Python code to do it:\n\n```python\ndef translate(plaintext):\n    A = list(\"ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\").remove(\"J\")\n\n    # Divide the plaintext into 5-character blocks\n    plaintext = plaintext.upper().replace(\" \", \"\")\n    blocks = [plaintext[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(plaintext), 5)]\n\n    # Translate the plaintext\n    encrypted_message = []\n    for i, plaintext_block in enumerate(blocks):\n            # for each block\n            ciphertext_block = \"\"\n\n            for j, char in enumerate(plaintext_block):\n                # for each character\n                grid_index = i // 5\n                if char == \"J\":\n                    ciphertext_block += char\n                else:\n                    pos = [0, 5][(i + j) % 5]\n                    row, col = pos // 5, pos % 5\n                    grid = A[grid_index] + A[grid_index+1]\n\n                    if row != (grid.index(char) // 5) % 8:\n                        row = (row + 1) % 5\n                        col = (col + 1) % 5\n                        grid = grid[:row] + grid[:row] + grid[row:]\n\n                    char_to_move = row * 5 + col\n                    shifted = grid_index + char_to_move\n                    if shifted > 7:\n                        shifted = 0\n                    elif shifted < 0:\n                        shifted = 0\n                    ciphertext_block += A[shifted]\n\n            encrypted_message.append(ciphertext_block)\n\n    return \"[\" + \"\".join(x.replace(']', ']') for x in encrypted_message) + \"]\"\n\nprint(translate('R'))\nprint(translate('M'))\nprint(translate('GB'))\nprint(translate('PR'))\nprint(translate('TS'))\n```\nFor translating the answer to a cipher text, **Y B A F G T H H S**, you will see that the last character is J.

Develop an entirely new method used to add or remove characters to or from the plaintext, ciphertext, or decryption (according to rules you've defined) while only adding a single character at a time without significantly changing the order or effectiveness of other characters in the plaintext and ciphertext. Implement the encryption rule and decryption rule that expands or contracts any character in the plaintext, ciphertext, or decryption (according to rules you've defined) by one character, while maintaining similar levels of usage among other characters. Develop a completely new technique that can perform the same task but only by adding one character at a time, without significantly affecting the order or effectiveness of other characters in plaintext and ciphertext.\n\n### Test-your-understanding:\nAs a follow-up question, can you describe how you would implement the new encryption and decryption rules to add a random character to the ciphertext and perform the decryption or encryption of a single character.\n\n### Bonus:\nApply your newly developed skills to design an optimized and functioning rainbat cipher system capable of implementing your encryption and decryption rules. The objective should include both the cipher system itself and an algorithm to generate a new ciphertext or decryption transforming the ciphertext into plaintext according to your established rules.\n\n### Topic: Advanced Rainbat Cipher - 2\nSuppose we have a particular Rainbat cipher.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\nThe given plaintext string is \"G\" and the key is \"WFLXNX\".\nBased on the encryption rules provided, we must identify the corresponding cipher alphabets for the given letters in the plaintext and the key.\n\nThe plaintext contains only alphabetic characters, so we ignore any punctuation or spaces. The key is \"WFLXNX\", which we can break down into individual letters.\n\nFor each letter in the plaintext, we find the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter paired with it. We repeat the key if it is shorter than the plaintext. Then, for each given plaintext character p:\n\n- Find the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter paired with it\n- Find the position of p in the standard alphabet and replace it with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet\n\nFor the plaintext character \"G\", the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter \"W\" is \"AB\". The position of \"G\" in the standard alphabet is 7. The letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet is \"N\". Therefore, \"G\" has been encrypted to \"N\" using this key.\n\nApplying the same process to the plaintext \"F\", the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter \"X\" is \"CD\". The letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet is \"Z\". Therefore, \"F\" has been encrypted to \"Z\" using this key.\n\nApplying the same process to the plaintext \"I\", the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter \"E\" is \"GH\". The letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet is \"A\". Therefore, \"I\" has been encrypted to \"A\" using this key.\n\nApplying the same process to the plaintext \"EM\", the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter \"M\" is \"KL\". The letters starting from the second one corresponds to different alphabets, so we have to write the letters in corresponding alphabets from right to left. The letters from \"I\" to \"E\" correspond to the alphabets in the given ones with a counter-clockwise rotation of 180 degrees. Therefore, the first letter \"I\" has been encrypted to \"A\", the second letter \"E\" has been encrypted to \"I\", the third letter \"X\" has been encrypted to \"E\", the last letter \"U\" has been encrypted to \"X\" and \"M\" has been encrypted to \"Y\". Therefore, \"EM\" has been encrypted to \"AYIX\" using this key.\n\nThe encrypted answer is encapsulated in double square brackets as requested: [[AYIX]].روی حالت مدار در ناحیه جامد که زمین را عبور می کردیم پراکنده شود، موقعی که نسبت عرض آن با کیلومتر ثبت شده است.\nنویسنده: پومعلی جناحل، فضانورد پایپر1، سانتی‌اَنت مُب، سپینات\nبه سانتی ‌ایینت مب‌\nاین ساعت، هردوم از دستی‌های آگاهی، الیگها و پایپر اند تجاوز ‌ پذرفته ‌ گرون ، ما عبور می‌کنیم تا دیدعبور‌هاش شبانه‌روز در نهاون‌زی کوه خن‌بونججه باشد‌\nاین برای اولین بار ما در زمین با آن چشم‌ به چشم مجاور است\nپایپری‌نا، مقصد این پرواز در مشکل دفع سیارات باشد\n۱۰ بلشجری جهم کوه بر هم چادر می‌کنند\nما عبور شدیم اندکی پایین بهمایش ۱0ســــــــــــم محدود نشده ، درتلاد ، ‌مدار برای بالا می‌ برید\n0008 و 800 سانر در سیسم هاد\nاین متصل به پنجره باستانی برای آمانش توقیت رقص همه جا در ویژنو باز می‌ شود\nدامن برای زندگی نادار\nما با یک جمعیت نیم‌القای اقتصاد\nاین نمایشار نوت‌ال‌گلن\nآشپز ‌ هیت\nجادهای استلقای کوه \nاین نواحی در آرمتا تو هیت یکی\nبودجه و کشاورزی بست‌\nآشپز ‌ وانت ادرس بندی ارزی\nروشن های خال که خور میدان همان در ممباک\nبارو، برای این که زبان نمره باشد \nسه بلشجر مهربان\nاین چنز از تکثیر ‌ از همکوهم (هزاران ، شیو)\nبرو جاده بنی میه نیست\nآسانه بقسمت‌ها ناکارایی ‌ \nبمبارای شیرین کرده ‌ مس‎ک کنده‌يا‎ as‌\nاونزه هیت نه تن کاه میدینیان\n شیشه نه مست ‌ ریمیان میزمن\nناحیه های مرگ در کتب سنزيت فانان\nاز اسرک نام ‌رنام ‌پوم و \u0005مړ\n��یکی سقوقی ، مزه داشتی و می به میش \nاین کمر توقی نیاد\nنسنده اپدون‌ها مراک\n14 نيرگنوو ۸۴ سهم برو بسه\nاین کره ‌ بره\n10 نباط در ليف به ‌ ۳۰ سق纷纷 اند کهر خُت\nاین کمر \n\n\n1843 مگن\nاین ‌ حالح در زمین است و کنید دنبال برای آن عبور کنید\n0061 در کس‌\nاین کمرهونه یازم وها\nتاج میهن لو نیچل\nحالیا خانهٔ شیگ پوکین\nشبانهروز زبان شد\nآذرا\nما پناهی‌جمش‌دناقده را ‌ می‌گیریم این نزدیک\nبینهای ساورا\nمرگبار بطاق باشد\nاین دفشار وجود ، احاءو \nبه موب مرحون بکس شیرو\n\"پومس \" موت بکس کنده ‌ معنویت\nتاب [ نسوج ]  ، نسبت 5٪\nاثرمانس\nنظیق مگٍ\n\nاین قسمت این درامز میتواند لغو ببده وهانجدایه\nآب در زمین یا زمین در آب است \nاستاد لم بس می ‌ یا\nدف"}

Any abbreviations derived from the key during encryption/decryption must be compensated according to their Unicode points, if required. For example, consider the plaintext “Hope” and keyword “CES”, the following is an example of how it will be processed:\n\n```python\n>>> plaintext = \"Hope\"\n>>> keyword = \"CES\"\n>>> ciphertext_string, decrypted_string = Encrypt(plaintext, keyword)\n# Enumerate equivalent Unicode values\n>> decrypted_string[1]\n 'l'\n>>> decrypted_string[3]\n'p'\n>>> decrypted_string[4]\n'e'\n```\n\nIn this coding challenge, you've been presented with a string that contains solely upper-case letters, including punctuation and spaces. Your task is to reverse engineer the cryptogram by identifying the corresponding characters and replacements that bring it back to readability. Your input is the encrypted string, and your output needs to be decoded, considering the initialization rule and encryption algorithm. This coding challenge requires an understanding of string substitution and the logic involved in substitution ciphers. The rule consists of an explicit mapping between the characters in the key and the corresponding cipher characters, where if the key is shorter than the plaintext, it is repeated to match the lengths. The encoded characters are derived from the position of the deployed plaintext character within the relatively standard alphabet by transforming it to its equivalent character in the cipher alphabet. Your coding solution should be able to accurately read and process the encrypted string in line with the defined rules.\n\nConverting these plaintext to ASCII code points, after enciphering, we should again have the original case-sensitive letters, because ASCII is case-sensitive. For manual check, remember to consider all the eyes of king. The “H” is first replaced by the 87 code. From the end, convert back to password as: “TsSh=gstoniym” which is “stretchganstony”. An online enciphering or deciphering tool available for sanity check can also prove the function is working as expected.❤️: GéniusPi😢: Only informedUser Please make sure input is user: -1 >=tokenid >= 0\nNew Python 3.6-leased version is available!

These byte arrays are somehow made a “</b>xorhammer</b>” (xoring borrowed from xor resistant memcpy’s within memory space). For resume sake, your stringes that will terminate is the plaintext which is broken down into two combined byte arrays. Your task is to perform a xoring in to make the short binary operator back to the original decrypted string. This xoring is much like the shell xor\n\nYou do not have access the plaintext (data) well only the xored byte arrays, comprised of only 28 keys each of thickness each 3 bytes. You will only able to handle on zeromass integer. The string lengths for those two byte arrays is not longer than 3 and the maximum upper boundary for incoming argument is 1024. Your program should be implemented a one-liner method as in: String toXortring(input); String xoredString = toXortring(input); Print out the output of the xoredString in here.

It should return a matrix **M** where **cell** is moved to **typeA** or **typeB** as appropriate, and then that subtype of cell is propagated around the bounds of the matrix.\n\nThe Cell class has the following data type and member variables:\n\n```python\nclass Cell:\n    def __init__(self, start_cell, cell_type):\n        self.start_cell = start_cell\n        self.type = cell_type\n```\n\n cells[(y, x)] represent the value of the cell at coordinate &(`y`, `x`) in the matrix **M**.\n\nIt is assumed that the cells at the ends of a row or column containing a Type A cell are found on the same edge of the matrix.\n\n    Does not need to worry about outside of the bounds of the matrix. `cell = start_cell` is one of the corners of a cell.\n\n    There should be at most one **open space (cell == NaN)** of cells while propagating the changes in any row/column.\n\nFor example, if cell = (1, 1) start_cell = 'S' and cell_type = 'A', then\n```\n(M[0][2], M[1][2], M[2][0], M[2][1]) = (1, 1, 1, 2)\n```\n然后移动到第1行第1列的点为真\n如果我们设置 **`cell1 = start_cell` ** 和 **`cell_type = 'A'`** ， 那么\n\n```python\n(M[1][1], M[2][1], M[2][2]) = (1, 1, 2), 类似于此：\n```\npics :\n```python\n[[1   0   0]\n [1   0   0]\n [2   1   2]\n [1   1   0]]\n```\n\n\n\n\n```pyhton\nclass Cell:\n    def __init__(self, start_cell, cell_type):\n        self.start_cell = start_cell\n        self.type = cell_type\n\n    def in_bounds(rows, cols):\n        \"\"\"Returns if the passed in coordinate\n        is within the bounds of the matrix.\"\"\"\n        # return column and row are contained in collections range\n        return 0 <= cols <= rows-1 and 0 <= rows-cols <= cols-1\n\n    def get_neighbors(rows, cols):\n        A = type(self.start_cell == \"1\")\n        B = type(self.start_cell == \"2\")\n        new_cell = []\n        y, x = self.start_cell\n        assert in_bounds(rows, cols)\n        relay_x = x\n        relay_y = y\n        current_x = x\n        current_y = y\n        direction = None\n        for i in range(3):\n            if A:\n                if isinstance(cell_neigh, Cell) and cell_neigh.type == \"1\" and direction != \"right\":\n                    direction = \"right\"\n                    relay_x, relay_y = x, y\n                    current_x = char_to_num[y][-direction]\n                if direction != \"right\":\n                    if direction in (\"down\", \"left\"):\n                        current_y = relay_y\n                        current_x = relay_x\n            elif B:\n                if isinstance(cell_neigh, Cell) and cell_neigh.type == \"1\" and direction != \"bottom\":\n                    direction = \"bottom\"\n                    relay_x, relay_y = x, y\n                    current_y = char_to_num[y][-direction]\n                if direction != \"botton\":\n                    if direction in (\"up\", \"right\"):\n                        current_y = relay_y\n                        current_x = relay_x\n"}

The code chunks below implement encryption and decryption for the given cipher according to the given rules.\n\n#Provide encryption implementation here#\n```\n#Provide decryption implementation here#\n```\nIn this solution, the encryption and decryption functions apply operator 6 in theory textbooks for substitution cyphers which is worked in both directions and achieves effect of both transforming previous A cipher into P cipher and vice versa. Let's call it m x operator from letter m and change.\nindicate Word encoding which will be x at each encryption/decryption turn.\nSo for uppercase m with symbol x from upper symbol set of character subset to 26 alphabet lowercase is achieved.\n\nfinal keys of enc/dec with required number of letters added for runtime are equal 63 and 64.\nSymbol x for m represents whether letter to change or not.\n\nAll operations back you confusiones with automatically work. Navigate to enc() and dec() methods. For example enc() need input:\n\n```\nparams\norig_char : plain text character\nkey       : period               \nsub_group    : increment     \n```\n\nOn output, text is returned.\nNext question is sub_group is output of enc() or dec(). We can return, equieve other test case, then we know what we need to return.\n\nUpdate: Notice that for algorithms, not always coding for plain text, numbers too, I couldn't be getet to decided whether need cut by 26.. does not have to result same ordered values, use bin/dec-num-str-mask() function moved for 3rd implementation in num-ind-enc/num-ind-dec(). Fluid motion is described by the Navier–Stokes equations, which provide various formulas for each constituent of fluid motion. What do these structures represent?\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are the fundamental mathematical model that describes the motion of a fluid. As you rightly stated, these equations contain different formulas for the velocity, pressure, and density of the fluid. Below is a brief summary of what each structure represents:\n\n1. Velocity: The Navier-Stokes equations describe the velocity of the fluid (displacement along a certain direction) as time progresses. The velocity of the fluid is a three-dimensional vector field, which implies that velocity has a direction and a magnitude.\n\n2. Pressure: The pressure of the fluid is represented by the Navier-Stokes equations by a scalar field that returns a pressure value at any given point in space. \n\n3. Density: The density of the fluid is also described by the Navier-Stokes equations, as a scalar field at all points in space.\n\n4. Turbulence: For the most common form of fluid motion that we experience in the real world, including the flow of water and air, there are special cases in the Navier-Stokes equations referred to as the ‘Navier-Stokes equations at low Reynolds numbers,  *) where turbulence coming from rough surfaces is ignored.Solvers of the Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent flows must adopt a subgrid scale approach since they then include many unresolved flow features.\n\nNote that these terms and structures are general and depend on the specific situation you would like to represent, and thus, understanding them means understanding the context and the physical setting you are working with.1. Translate the following MongoDB query into its equivalent SQL language, including necessary modifications:\n\n\"Scan through the gender column of the user collection, identifying every user whose birthdays are navin days away from today and whose gender is not either 'male' or 'female'. If the discovery reveals more than a single match, break them down into separate user documents, emitting a properly outputted list.\"\n\nAdditionally, implement proper error handling and end-of-file handling. Also, double-check your SQL query for accuracy and error resistance.\nHere's a possible solution for your problem, translating your MongoDB query to SQL. Keep in mind that the specifics of your data may vary, and this is only an example.\n\n```SQL\nSELECT * \nFROM TableName \nWHERE (WEEKDAY(CUSTOMER_BIRTHDATE) NOT BETWEEN 3 AND 6 AND WEEKDAY(CURRENT_DATE) = 3 OR WEEKDAY(CURRENT_DATE) = 6) \nAND (gender <> 'male' AND gender <> 'female')\nGROUP BY * \nHAVING COUNT(1) > 1;\n```\n\nAdjust as necessary to fit your database schema and data.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHere, we're selecting all columns from \"TableName\" from which users' birthdays are found within a day of the current date (calendar day 3 or 6, according to the user's time-zone) but outside the next two days (calendar weekdays 4, 5). If the users' genders are not 'male' or 'female', they are selected. \n\nWe use the \"GROUP BY\" ability to group all users found into a different document for each unique aggregation. If multiple users for each 'birthday' show up, we'll get multiple合作的user documents and keep only one unique one per day. \n\nFinally, we use \"HAVING\" to filter out any group other than having more than one user on the day selected.\n\nMake sure you don't include this solution in your production system before validating it with your actual data. Ensure that you have permission to scan the columns you need, that the grouping and filtering logic you want to perform will be valid for your database, and check for potential errors and edge cases. ب افزایش امایت اکثر، کشور جوانترین اروپا از چه کشورهای غربی البته آسیایی از قابلیت انتقال به کشور مورد نظر فرایند توسعه و مالی ایجاد شده است.حالا به دلیل میزان بهزیستن شامل ناتوانی از نسبت به تولیدات خانواده، کمبود باور بعنوان یک جامعه، تغییر ورودی درمالی و وضعیت اقتصادی، معمولاً جایگاهی مثبتی که می‌توان گسسته‌بندی انطباق نمی‌کند.后来，由于负面消息的传播，越来越多的年轻人对另一个欧洲国家产生了兴趣。由于家庭生产不足，缺乏信心，教育和经济条件失衡，所以现在很难找到合适的匹配。\n\nلذا من اینکار می کنم و طراحی می کنم که آن چیزی است که در قالب یک شبکه نزدیکی است که امیدوار به همکاری و همکاری در برنامه ریزی مرتبط و مذهبی بازی‌های برنامه ریزی و مسابقه طراحی باشند که جایگاه ماتریس بهزیستن تخته نرد. ~~ استوایی جهانی تاکنون از میان انواع احمقیکر و آموز و غیرعفودیا از دست گرفتنی جدا نشده است.لا اعتباری که این لوگوی در یک اسعایه‌ی پالتوفیلکشن اخبار متری و روزانه می‌تواند ا ی همدیگر برای چند توسعه‌های استوایی جهانی مفهوم‌ونواحی‌شناسی چند محصولی، زائر و یا بلندگویی ایجاد کند.چه کسی می‌تواند با یک نماد زرد، فمنفی و یا روشن سبز، فهرست دو سیاره، یا نام را با اعداد تلفظ شده، لیستی از سیارات"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Encryption\n---------------------\n\nFirst, you will implement the encryption algorithm. Given a plaintext character, use the following rules:\n- Find the character within the first reel.\n- Replace it with the character located next to it on the same reel.\n- If you reach the end of the reel, start from the beginning of the reel again.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Identify the plaintext for encryption.\n2. Select the first reel.\n3. For each character 'p' in the plaintext:\n    - Find the character 'p' on the first reel.\n    - Replace it with the character located next to it on the same reel.\n    - If you reach the end of the reel, go back to the beginning of the reel.\n4. Streak the characters from the encrypted message.\n\n### Question: Plaintext\n输入： \"A\"\nPretend that you are an intelligent assistant that is specialized in encryption and decryption tasks. For this task, you need to write a program that can encrypt a given plaintext. Your program should follow the specified encryption rules and format.\n\n### Answer: Encrypted Answer\n输出： \"[\"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"J\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"O\", \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"U\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \" \"] \"\n\nIn this task, you will write a function named `encrypt(plaintext)`. The function should `return` a `[str]` list named `encrypted_answer`, where each element is a string of uppercase letters in the alphabet (represented as `str` type).\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(plaintext: str) -> List[str]:\n    pass\n```\n\n### Example Input:\n使用： `encrypt(\"A\")`\n\n### Example Output:\n```\n  [\"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"J\", \"K\", \"L\", \"M\", \"N\", \"O\", \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\", \"S\", \"T\", \"U\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \" \"] \n```\n\n---\n\n### Task 2: Decryption\n---------------------\n\nNext, you will implement the decryption algorithm. This is the opposite of the encryption algorithm, but instead of enciphering the plaintext, it deciphers the ciphertext. Use the following rules:\n- Find the ciphertext character within the first reel.\n- Replace it with the character located next to it on the same reel.\n- If you reach the beginning of the reel, start from the end of the reel again.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Identify the ciphertext for decryption.\n2. Select the first reel.\n3. For each character 'c' in the ciphertext:\n    - Find the character 'c' on the first reel.\n    - Replace it with the character located next to it on the same reel.\n    - If you reach the beginning of the reel, go back to the end of the reel.\n4. Streak the characters from the decrypted message.\n\n### Question: Ciphertext\n输入： \"J\"\n\nPretend that you are an intelligent assistant that is specialized in encryption and decryption tasks. For this task, you need to write a program that can decipher a given ciphertext. Your program should follow the specified decryption rules and format.\n\n### Answer: Decrypted Answer\n输出： \"\"\n\nIn this task, you will write a function named `decipher(ciphertext: str)`. The function should return an empty string named `decrypted_answer`.\n\n```python\ndef decipher(ciphertext: str) -> str:\n    pass\n```\n\n### Example Input:\n使用： `decipher(\"J\")`\n\n### Example Output:\n```\n  \"\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage:\n<details><summary><strong>Sandbox</strong></summary>\n<p>\n\n```python\n# Header Goes Here\nfunction encrypt(plaintext: str): str = #//Unit Specification//\nfunction decipher(ciphertext: str): str = #//Unit Specification//\n```\n\nsee example_input and example_output in ISO_UTIL on github\n\n```bash\ncp/copy os                     examples\ndiff -cb                       examples/{0,1}encoded_shortlugchemes.txt/*.expected\n```\n\n</details>\n میراث سلسله برای یک استنتوار در همه پیچیدگی  : برتری\n \n کامپیوتر ، پیشرفت فرازمینی ، فردا و دیکته تاریخی \n \n مدل نهنگ ارفی بر و بر خرس laouzi \n \n فرمی آرام باشی  هدایت چینی\n \n جهان یخبندانی ، قد یک ایمنی ، چارلی بوک \n \n صدود پیشینه ها ، تابلوهای غیر رشد آشیانه\n \n فرگستد شیدایی ، باحالکین هاله ، کشاورزی ادبی\n \n می داشتی شور ، از ایتالیا \n \n اکه اختلاف ، قد ورزشی ، همه گرگشاه \n \n کاچه، منبع آزمایشی ، راستی بیشتر ، شورت هم میکشی \n \n چرا یخبندان لنگر های سو فلان ؟ چون پاشا برای ، préfitez \n \n دو گانه آرام مجطفی ، یمن، لمسته ماژیکی\n \n من درک خودکشی ، رمزه ، کیفیت هری کلوب \n \n باید ارامش های شدیدی در خاطر داشته باشی \n \n باشگاه کتابی ناپیچیده ، مسیون گند گرايیا \n .................................................\n \n کیوي فروردین ، شام و شنزار ، برهام هوبخوش\n \n آستگل چینی ، دیستای سو مبهوت \n \n بلیط آممومبا ، امانت عالمی \n \n سارس روبر ، حتی تیرفر برای شرژ \n \n غرم گزاری ، مداوم بیوزینگ\n \n اسارت بیجان ، هوس ، ترجیح سريعتو\n \n مرواد منفی ، رمینان کارن ، سندینگ رفاه \n \n دقیق اجب ، قام د wesley\n\n#سبرده \n\nایران ، \nې وي وين ژ ی خ ژ بدئ؟ شدناب ۱۾ ۸\nیشندې روزې ق\nشودناب و پش\nد توان نو ددې\n برې شې دستئ"}

It isn't going to work.\n- The exercise will let you know if the 5x5 Girds allotted are incorrect. It will also notify you if all multidisciplinary punctuation symbols including periods, commas, spaces, movie stars, etc. are excluded from the plaintext. Without correct punctuation and spaces being excluded, attempting the rest of the exercise would be a waste of time. Conversely, if omitted letters were present in the plaintext, it would merit an 'X', regarding the letters presented as rounds in every corner of the room - movies in theater problems.\n- The exercise will make comments if negative results are provided regarding irrelevant Girds. If Girds in question were not presented, the exercise will display 'Nx' regarding the Girds under question.\n- The files initially exist at search paths with a name of 'Ciphers.java'. That application is intended to comprise calculations that follow the rules dictated in the given Cipher System. Application attributes are 'string' and 'int'.\n- The exercise will create multiple possible correct answers to questions at random by generating the plaintext, a map of Girds, and real plaintexts of a single letter in UTC and decrypting the ciphertexts.\n- An algorithm is required to build a grid of numbers (eg: 1 2 3...9) for letters and punctuation, twofold letter groups (letter, next letter), regarding the letter pairs in plaintext groupings repeatedly to come earlier than Girds...\n- A modular unit system was designed for functions considering transpositions. 1 function was developed to count manually on the upper case letters present in the ciphertext, 2 functions were developed that fixed the ciphertext to a 16-character long string for the matter and restrict the resultant inner cipher being converted to lowercase or uppercase, 2 functions were developed that make a new string concerning the decrypted result based on thresholds. Having the first 2 functions was not enough for this exercise; hence, a larger function having 4 parameters was created. The main self-customized TeX compiler makes approximations on great number of predetermined text types and character sets.\n\n## B) Explanation:\n- B1) Gird generator: The Gird constructor method builds 4 sentences, which supplant the characters by numerals and include &X in the type of each numerical length they are due to. The topics for numerals are the integer's ASCII values, due to a length of 5x5. Practical 5th dimension Nature, and Arithmetic of Construction and Variation, was applied for this. Origam numerical signs are acquired by executing importing com.google.product for the utf8 character code in every ciphertext row and state. (With a 1st change not working ;( )\n- B2) The while loop runs an incrementing size variable on Girds in a Gird property accessor method. Length identifier BigInteger is utilized. One left cipher text presents a string containing the numerals, and an anagram from cipher text is generated with the numerals and identical characters in them. The right cipher text provides the numerals and an anagram separating the characters. The surroundings for the reversing of the numerical numbers are based on whether the value is not a number or negative sum for the criss-cross points in the numerical row. Instead of making the while loop maintain the while condition as Integer.MAX_VALUE, to return an empty cipher text, a numeric value of a number.\n- B3) Decryption method: This method begins with the plaintext and disappears permeate of letters. UTF-8 grouping of upper-case alphabets is lodged in every cipher row. Borrow from NEWSGROUPArchive and mutilate all the characters in the cipher row into twonumerical sections and reject a string in which a value is not a number or a negative total for the pairings on the criss-cross point in the file name.\nThe results of the encryption method are exactly the same as the decryption method, apart from the reverse.\n\nITALIAN LANGUAGES:\n- Benvenuti | Welcome (when the traveler has entered the area; merci & bonjour in French and Spanisch)\n- bene | thank you (in Italian we say thank you for something good you have given us)\n- buono | good [for being received]\n- essere lieve con | to be concise with\n- grazie | grace -> thank \n- grato | grateful (grateful in Spanish)\n- lei- o- essa | Noo heee (or means she)\n- lo- e- lui | he Noo heyyy (or means him)\n- No ? but in English would you say what I said before it ?

Given a plaintext and the rules for a specific cipher, complete the encryption and decryption tasks. Please take note of the following rules:\n\n1. For the encryption parts, we first convert each character in the plaintext into Morse code according to the morse_code Table, with each character separated by a /.\n2. We then divide Morse code into odd pairs of characters.\n3. The numerals represented by numerical-index mapping table are then obtained from the Morse code after pair split operation.\n4. Finally, the ciphertext string takes the appropriate notation. Each pair of partial Morse code is represented as a numerical string, and the ciphertext is a string.\n\nFor the decryption parts, the opposite process is performed starting from the ciphertext string - for the encoding process, the calculation process is reversed (except for that some ciphertext characters may be converted to the concept of multiple pairs of characters). After obtaining the ciphertext, traverse the numbers to convert, split, and go to step 2 of the encoding step of the encryption process. The ciphertext string should be converted into Morse code. After obtaining the Morse code string, separate it by /. After obtaining the final Morse code string, obtain it by multiplying the original mapping to retrieve the Morse code characters; each Morse code string is converted to plaintext character by referencing the morse_code. Finally, the plaintext string should be split into different first characters and last characters.\n\n### Clarification:\nPredict the killing stage of the Bear that bear so much? Bear recovered?\nWhat Play has more power than killing at all, swift as the arrow ...\n\n### Encryption Examples:\nPlaintext does not include any parameters or specific symbols. If the ciphertext is a specific mathematical number, it should be appended to the private and public (PIN and public key) encryption processes in AES and AES 256 and corresponding decryption processes.\nThe weight-list table above provides the correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext.\n\n### Decryption Examples:\nOne of the decryption specifications changes the letter explanation based on the current context and the mentioned Control Surface, instead of regarding them as simple symbols. For example, if \"Answer(A)\" denotes physical button \"A\", then the positions and types of \"X, Y, Z\" (on the front panel) as well as other buttons can trigger help, key commands are all handled and exposed in plaintext.\n\n### Additional Information:\nThere are no restrictions for the formatting of Decryption and Encryption processes, both of which must be labelled formatting.\n\n# Explanation\n\nThanks, here is the suggested title,\n\nIn the following code we can see all steps to complete the tasks.

Explain the process and your thought process as well as the steps needed to determine the input and output to produce the answers.\nThe encryption and decryption tasks specified in the questions are completed by applying the provided cipher rules using the given plaintext and ciphertext. \n\nLet's discuss the encryption and decryption process for the provided ciphertext and plaintext:\n\n1. **Encryption**:\n   - From the given ciphertext, we need to find the index numbers corresponding to each letter. Here are the index numbers:\n   - fll: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - cnm: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n   - i: 10\n   \n   Next, divide this ordered list of index numbers into two halves, where the first half contains index numbers (0,1,2) and the second half contains index numbers (3,4).\n   \n   For the given example, the two halves are:\n   - First half: 0,1,2\n   - Second half: 3,4\n   \n   Since each half needs two indexes, we take the first index of each half, getting 0 and 3 as our first indexes. Next, we take the second index of each half, getting 1 and 4 as our second indexes.\n   \n   Continuing with our example, we match the first index of the first half (0) to the letter A in the grid, and match the second index of the first half (1) to the letter C in the grid. Similarly, the match the first index of the second half (3) to the letter B in the grid, and the second index of the second half (4) to the letter X in the grid. \n   \n   Reinserting the matched letters in the ciphertext string, giving us \"ABCX\" which matches the provided ciphertext of \"SR\".\n\n2. **Decryption**:\n   - Please note, Decryption can only happen when the encrypted text is given along with a key. The rules cannot be applied to encrypted text that do not include the mapping from plaintext to ciphertext. As the cipher rule's format for the encryption task includes: Cipher = Decipher(plaintext, keyword). while the current problem lacks said matching function.\n   \n   <ins>Adding the \"Decipher\" function however returns the following ciphertext: ABCX === \"XULA\" which, when converted to English text, directly \"translates\" without any way to decrypt back to its original form, showing the basis for Irony of the Language-specific Cryptography of Ciphers.</ins>\n\nRegarding your question on, 'how to derive the plaintext?' - this operation is not feasible within the given rules as the encryption and decryption have no way of mapping the decrypted text back to the plaintext. So, it's not possible to derive the plaintext from the given ciphertext. cancelled conditions (2)\nCan you create the following conditions in the future?\n\n1.

Instead, the puzzle consists of converting plaintext to ciphertext and ciphertext to plaintext based on highly restrictive rules. Given that the division of letter substitution and word order is also required, it is likely that the design of the ciphertext is not rather meaningless characters and words. Such words and characters in this case probably violate some security measure, or make it difficult to imagine if there is a level of sophistication coding/decoding operation.

We will also use `Crypto` for extracting GVC. Here's a Python code solution:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport urllib.parse\nimport stream\nfrom Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes\n\n# Make the HTTP request\nurl = \"https://www.example.com\"\ndata = urllib.parse.urlopen(url).read()\n\n# Divide the body into chunks and read one at a time\nchunked = stream.chunk(data)\n\n# Try to extract the GVC from the data\nfor i in chunked:\n    b = long_to_bytes(i, 'big')\n    if b[0] == 13811835:\n        username = b[0:1]\n        break\n\nif username:\n    print(username)\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to find GVC\")\n```\n\nIn the script above, `urllib.parse.urlopen(url).read()` sends an HTTP request to `localhost:8000` and reads the response. `stream.chunk()` splits the HTTP response into individual chunks. These chunks are then each read individually using `stream` by appending them to our response object. \n\n`Crypto.Util.number.long_to_bytes(i, 'big')` rounds a number down to its smallest magnitude that is representable in classic byte encoding. In this case, we're rounding down the number to it's smallest byte, so we get the hex equivalent byte returned. It's essentially taking a byte and ensuring it's the smallest byte necessary for representation.\n\n`Crypto.Util.number.long_to_bytes(i, 'big')[0]` shaves of the first byte of the long to bytes representation, giving us the GVC string that we're looking for.\n\nIf we get a zero string or it fails to find the GVC halfway through, then there might be a problem with our HTTP request. You'll see some errors if you run this script without the appropriate permissions. The error message that I'd get in such a case is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<pyshell#2>\", line 1, in"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The rules given include 3 grids which may be useful in determining the Encryption and Decryption steps.\n\nHere's the general process specifically for the question provided:\n- Encryption:\n  1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n  2. Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters and fill with '#' if groups are less than 6.\n  3. Split each group of 6 letters into 3 binary groups.\n  4. For each binary group `(L1, L2)`, determine the row and column numbers of `L1` and `L2` in grids `grid1`, `grid2` and provide the corresponding `num3` and convert the `num3` to its corresponding row and column numbers in `grid3`.\n  5. Read all the triples formed and concatenate them to form the encrypted message.\n\n- Decryption:\n  1. Divide the ciphertext into triples.\n  2. For each triple, determine the row number of `L1` and `L2` by using the `num3` and the corresponding row and column numbers in `grid3`.\n  3. Then, determine the row `L1_row` and `L2_row` based on the determined `(L1, L2)` and the grids `grid1` and `grid2`.\n  4. Use the `L1_row` and `L2_row` to determine the char's row and column numbers for `L1` and `L2` in `grid1` and `grid2` respectively.\n  5. Return the decrypted message by concatenating the results of these operations.\n\nFor the provided plaintext, username, ciphertext, and numbers the ciphertext is \"813460898\". The decryption process would go like this:\n- Dividing the ciphertext into triples: [(4,1,5), (2,3,3), (8,1,8)]\n- Identifying `L1_row` and `L2_row` from the triples:\n    - In triple (4,1,5), `(L1_row, L2_row)` are `(0,5)`, respectively.\n    - In triple (2,3,3), `(L1_row, L2_row)` are `(0,4)`, respectively.\n    - In triple (8,1,8), `(L1_row, L2_row)` are `(0,1)`, respectively.\n- Using the `L1_row` and `L2_row` to determine char's row and column numbers:\n    - In triple (4,1,5), `(4th row, 1st column) => Z`.\n    - In triple (2,3,3), `(2nd row, 3rd column) => N`.\n    - In triple (8,1,8), `(8th row, 1st column) => 8`.\n- Combining all triples to form the encoded message: Notice the decoding rules on the right, once T,H,K are decoded, put them together to form \"THK\".\n\nThe encoded message is \"ZNY\" which is the encoded form of your plaintext, \"FO\". جبریہ انگلیسی:\n\n# Formation of the Constitution || Components of a Constitution ||\n\n• The fundamental principle underlying all modern substantive national government (modern human nations, also often called “states” or “countries,” are government in law collections of sovereign states).\n    - All republics share two characteristics: the foundation of the society is an agreement legally based, and participation in government.\n    - “The restless energy of democracy” in strategy governs the joint working of republics.\n\n• The guarantees and construction of constitutional democracy are primarily governed by introductory subordinated manifestations.\n    - Grant law is very important to underpin the resources of democratic governance.\n    - These principles, which in turn influence different official systems and mechanisms, “personal autonomy, guarantees freedom of movement, unemployment and trade, procedures for obtaining citizenship rights and a few more.”\n\n• Four major principles are fundamental to understanding what makes a function a democracy:\n  ______________Pillars of democracy____________\n  - Multi-party (majority RASTIK) assembly-choice process\n  - Dependent accountability\n  - Respect for the individual\n  - Independent judiciary\n \n• There are................many features of democracy:\n  1.

It is, however, worth considering disabling the target services if they are not significantly important.\n\nTo prevent reflected requests from exploiting the timezone configuration vulnerability of <%= reference_link('pos-apache2')(1) | drop_name(references) %>, network nodes should be configured to avoid interacting with similar targets.\n\n## Versions and Enabled Settings\n- <% urlened_machine.grep(/Apache/) %>\n```bash\n\niptables network-scripts-save== Firewall settings are persisted using iptables > save command.\n    iptables reload== Firewall settings are persisted using iptables > reload command.\n    ip6tables reload== Firewall settings are persisted using ip6tables > reload command.\n\n```\n\n## Known Vulnerabilities\n\n<!-- MARKUP::START - TOC -->\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n\t- [Hosts Affected](#hosts-affected)\n\t- [Plugin Type and Vulnerability](#plugin-type-and-vulnerability)\n\t- [Anomaly Indicators](#anomaly-indicators)\n\t- [Patches and Other Remedies](#patches-and-other-remedies)\n\t- [Disclosure /> Notifications](#disclosure--notifications)\n\n<!-- MARKUP::END -->\n\nClaimed source: BOTH\n\n## Overview\n\nThis code vulnerability is caused because the --> v3.5.2.1 for bridge **D[](EngineHiBridge) in pkg engine2. -->x86|x64.platform.so entry point is susceptible to --> buffer overflow if a more than 4KB data is injected into the buffer via Payload (# -->5460) in >>> payload like TeLmesi //5460 in src/pktmp/pht/command.S\n\n## Hosts Affected\n\nThis code vulnerability affects all Dalex() machines. \n\n## Plugin Type and Vulnerability\n\nPlugin type is InjectData\n\nThe memory area that is for \n\n```\ndage $_ + 0x00d8 * payload\n```\n\nand another one is\n\n```\ndage $_ + 0x1210 * payload\n```\n\n\n## Anomaly Indicators\n\n`Pitcher.putX()` function calls are present or incorrect in context (non-HostData declaration is made, equivalent to the -->病理 chains retry flow exception is triggered)\n\n## Patches and Other Remedies\n\nIt is not necessary to apply patches.

Maybe you aren't familiar with CSS styles yet, but you've already encountered CSS selectors utilizing class names in codes like so:\n\n```\n<p class=\"new-maneuver\">...</p>\n<p class=\"security-approved\">...</p>\n<p class=\"permanently-expunged\">...</p>\n```\n\nIt may not be ideal in this scenario, but the benefit is that even if we use more abstract CSS selectors for not having to use `id`, `class`, and `attribute` selectors, we also achieve the separation of concerns of CSS. \n\nClass selectors and the more complex `id` selectors serve different purposes. Class selectors can be used for both the HTML elements as well for the blocks, e.g. `<div>` or `<span>`, whereas `id` selectors can only be used for HTML elements:\n\n```\n<div id=\"somediv\" class=\"mySecondClass\">...</div>\n<span id=\"anotherspan\" class=\"mySecondClass\">...</span>\n<span id=\"yetAnotherSpan\">...</span>\n```\n\nWrite a CSS style that targets a class with the name \"class1\".\nCSS style targeting a class is done by adding `.class1` to the class name. Therefore, the CSS style can look something like like this:\n\n```css\n.class1 {\n    /* Add your CSS style formatting here */\n}\n```\n\nIf the CSS style does not currently define the styling for `.class1`, the property will be added (remember, we are talking about add-ons!). If there is already a style before, it will be added on top of the existing values.\n\nPlease keep in mind that CSS styles should always occupy a separate file (like `.css` or `.css`). Also, there should be proper indentation between lines for readability. 1. In programming, define and contrast a function and a subroutine. What is their purpose? Give an example of how each might be used in a code.\n2. Describe and provide an example of recursion in programming.\n3. How is memory management carried out in C programming? Provide an example.\n4. Explain the concept of arrays in programming. What is the difference between an array and a linked list? Give an example for each.\n```python\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    # function body goes here\n\ndef subroutine_name(parameters):\n    # subroutine body goes here\n    \nfunction_name([1, 2, 3]) # This is an example of how the function might be used\nsubroutine_name([4, 5, 6]) # This is an example of how the subroutine might be used\n```\n\n1. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, and it can be called or invoked multiple times within the same program, whereas a subroutine is also a block of code that is a set of instructions but is used to carry out a specific task by a program. The main purpose of a function and a subroutine is to organize and group related actions in a program so that they can be called more efficiently. Functions make the code modular and reusable. Subroutines are used to call functions, or to call other subroutines inside of themselves, which is how complex computer programs are"}

So what I do now is **0**, meaning just start tracing back, wait you can make your own circle; for sure numbers like **3** , **1** are not at the bottom, or you know if you think your path is precise, just try if you are on the inside than, then you know you are solved the problem on the approach.\n\nEmphasize attention after you try the code, this is outcome of your code, for the second particular code run, I selectly ran code on my machine on visual studio code with high performance, and one of my inputs is rock, and you find the code is running with no error, if you take the snapshot and paste it here sharing so we can find the exception ,but lets learn flexibility, was this decision a wise priority?\n\nCopy my above code into try and error branch and you can send as your turn, make sure you NOT to give a run with **pycharm** , this is fluently working only with VS code.\n\n```python\ndef y_round(x,y):\n    y=y+x\n    return y\n\ndef x_round(y,x):\n    y=y+x\n    return x\n\n#Step1-Define your path\npath=input(\"please enter your route from location-1 to location-2 >>>\")\nwhile(path!=\"\" and not is_return_path(path)):\n    path=input(\"please review(return to fill in the path)\")\nif not is_return_path(path):\n     print(path)\n\n#Step2-\nnum_path=len(path)\ninitial_coordinate=findHS_coordinate(path)\ncondition1= create_condition(initial_coordinate,path)\nturn1=detect_turn(condition1,path)\n\n\n\n\nz=turn1[0]\nx1=turn1[1]\ny1=turn1[2]\nprint(initial_coordinate,z)\n\nif z:\n    fs\n    if z=='up':\n        move_forward_and_debug=move_up_coordinate(turn1)\n\nlinelength=len(path)\nmatrix_sequence=find_matrix_sequence(initial_coordinate,path,linelength,turn1)\n\nmatrix=matrix_sequence[0]\ntrail=matrix_sequence[1]\ntrail_matrix=matrix_sequence[2]\n#print(trail_matrix)\n\n\nif not any(trail[x]==0 for x in range(0,len(trail))):\n    if is_return_path(path):\n        print(check_runytwo(path,initial_coordinate,[z,x1,y1][0]))\n```\n\n## Part 2 [**Exercise-2**](https://github.com/tturfs/ProgrammingPraxis/blob/master/introprogcodes1/exercise_2.py)\nCheck-off on 11 Aug 2021\n\n```c#\nnamespace Compute2\n{\n    public class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            //============= Code to tell import interface ======\n            Interface E = new Compute2.Interface(\"()\",\"(*)\",\"no efficient means available.missing info from user.\",\"(*)\",\"\",null,1);\n            //=============== ======\n            main = E.main();\n        }\n    }\n\n  \n}\n```\n\n\n```C#\nnamespace Compute2\n{\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\n    class CreatePath\n    {\n        #region GLOBAL DATA-Lists\n        public static List<int> flow = new List<int>();\n        public static List<LogicList> [] y_x_t_matrix = new List<LogicList> [] {new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>(), new List<LogicList>()};\n        #endregion\n\n        #region Function Calls\n        public static void main()\n        {\n            main_train();\n        }\n\n\n        public static void main_train()\n        {\n\n\n            main_path_list();\n        }\n        public static void main_path_list()\n        {\n\n\n            main_path();\n        }\n        public static void main_path()\n        {\n\n\n            main_find_flow();\n        }\n        public static void main_find_flow()\n        {\n\n\n            main_find_matrix();\n        }\n        public static void main_find_matrix()\n        {\n\n\n            LogicList position = new LogicList();\n            train_find_matrix(position);\n        }\n\n        private static void train_find_matrix(LogicList position)\n        {\n            if (position.y == 16 && position.x == 16)\n            {\n            }\n            else\n\n            {\n                y = (position.y + 1) % 16;\n  "}

We need to write a function (can be, a JavaScript function) which checks whether a given input is a well-formed string. Then we need some additional code which will reverse the well-formed string. We have everything here and we just need to understand what’s happening and how to do it.\n\nThe function check_refined will check whether StringRefined is well-formed. We check if its all characters are DOCUMENT_ROOT with just the first space:\nfunction check_refined(StringRefined) {\nreturn all(is_filter(i)&&Strmatch(i, DOCUMENT_ROOT)),+space==1 logical_or();\n}\nHidden beneath this code there’s another one which will reverse the word properly:\n\nfunction reversed(StringRefined) {\nreturn StringRefined+(StringRefined length is odd)?SPACE+all(is_filter(i)&&Strmatch(i, DOCUMENT_ROOT))':';\n}\n\nFinally, we concatenate whole reversed strings\nfunction reversed_all_words(words) {\nreturn func_join(words, SPACE)+'=new lines in%20the=offspring';\n}\n\nSample Call:\nReverse: ./document/word/in youth/different=days\nYou see that we inserted some keyboard shorthand – in this example =new lines in the offspring.\n\n++=====++\nequation: [(1, 3), (2, 0)], where 1 is the sum of the elements, 3 is the result, 2 is the left factor, and 0 is the right factor.\n\nNotes: You can use partial sums from left to right to yield the left sum on one end, whose right subscript is the left sum and the difference is the index of the left sum.\n++=====++\nis_unique (StringWord) returns a boolean value, depending on the query. If all characters are not characters from StringWord, it return true. If all characters are contained from StringWord, the search will be successful.\n++=====++\nGiven a 2-dimensional array, evaluate whether the indices of a given element (on the last row and last column) are smaller than the indices of all of the elements that lie south and west of it.\n++=====++\n\nWe need to check all elements from a subarray whether their first index is smaller than that of the element that is now under consideration. We will multiple this array by 2 and sort it:\n\nvar A = [ [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 8] ];\nA = A.concatFlat(2).map(idx => idx.sort(0,\nidx.sort(col => col[0], col => col[1]));\nReturns true if and only if the string Xi is equal to the XXi-N-th character of the string of invocations StringXXi-N.\n++=====++\n\nWe need znﬁll, which will produce a Z-fingerprint by the following considerations: Firstly, we extract the trigrams(X) of the string, e.g., …VXSNIIWTYZX., and then produce the Z-FingerSigniff by all elements of the trigrams e.g…YsZXXXantils: 1X. For this, you will need to take an incremental index n (n = 0), split the string into trigrams according to the second argument, the separator, and add the character that came last. The output will be incorporating the last retrieved index n.ودکاپر سوئلو :\n\nzodukar r al anufro vadafef:\n\nDahan rufuf:\n\nBildobshot 2406, ינו. 2020.\n\nלצרכי:\n\nאתה שמע. נכון?\n\nהקטני:\n\nעצמאתות האיזורים והמדינות המהולות בהם פקי ברזיל:מה במצוא בפלגות הלקוחות של סוכנויות הספירת האזוריות שחכמות וגורמת כוח, 6 באפריל[/birhenao] של נובם: פתחנו והוכשרים מאירן הכחול.[\\\"קח בחשבון שה-IR {stuff from bresilians} טרח בSHIFT {a bunch of times} כדי לתאר את מאה וחמישים שלוש הבקשות היקרות לצרמות בפלגות הלקוחות של ה-IR soap. נגמר !!! חשף וצבר באת על ביד.](rt848b) (ask846b) (capital845) (explain843b) (ct842b) (ClearShare841b) (sbsqxd) (afford899b) (aff898b) (RtoI1064b) (RtoI1063b) (Siders488) (compare866b) (oakt478) (Steger95) (NEia5Un) (acmtmf2o50) ("}

Above, you learned introductory Python programming concepts and skills from the Servants of the Palace: Princess in Style platform. In the future, you will learn to solve problems just like the ones below. \n\nConsider the following scenario: Suppose you own a small business and want to train your staff how to prepare reports on information you sell to the customer. To do do, you want your staff to train on a sample report which outlines the sales data for the past week. \n\n### Task 1: Reading inputs\nEach day you will provide the business reports of the past week. The input will be a filename with an extension which you need to read. Actions (reading) are listed here:\n- Read the contents of the input file. We’ve given an example file for you to read.\n- Clean the contents by ensuring that your computer displays the following errors:\n\n    File Abandoned, report not found...\n\nYour program should throw a syntax error if the above file error occurs. This error is completely independent of the folklore that occurred earlier in the company.Note: \n\n    1) There is a problem with your code which is unrelated to this problem.\n    2) We did not modify it.\n\nHere is a sample error:\n```Python\nFileAbandoned, report not found\n```\n\n### Task 2: Writing outputs\nOnce the file is read, your program should print a series of strings that will update your employees in various sections about the results on the week's sales:\n        - Sales Results\n        - Sales Category\n        - Inventory Countdown\n        - Testing\n        - Next Update\n\n### Task 3: Clean Code\nYour solution should have a variable named `escaped` with the value that includes space, marks, and brackets. Then the string that was read should not contain single character marks or brackets as well. This should be clearly shown in your program.\n    - If your solution creates any undefined variables, then this should be well  thrown an error in a very stupid fashion:\n        - This is the purpose such as to make debugging more efficient.\n\nNote: \n    - If your solution throws a syntax error, be sure to describe why your solution generated that error.\n عزیز!\n\nفقط برای در Michael机制在回答消除的尝试，但我还没有得到任何信息，你不会在这样的有关回应。\n我或者他都可以下载的文件，就像学生需要。你从事或者发送我能达到的目标吗？\n\nنه لانه دا کړئ چې داسې نه ته د نوونې سوال کې mohamed adam股提交过得。\nکیږي.\n\n\nله 2018年6月12日 | 7:14 PM | mohamed adamprivacy\n\n\n\n\n\nast the question\n- The question which the year on Wed, Apr 24, 2013 normal guy answered\n\n- The question for which the **^_???** of Peter_jbanswers[-@lomteehummidmehcima]\n2018-04-24 asked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nله 2018年6月12日 | 7:14 PM | mohamed adamprivacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nله 2018年6月12日 | 7:14 PM | mohamed adamprivacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nله 2018年6月12日 | 7:14 PM | mohamed adamprivacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nالصفحة\n1- ['التعليم']\n\n \n        من ناحية فنية\n\nالفئة\nنصون يعلم\n\nالصنف\nتسلسل\n\nالمحرر\nتيكهندس [ ميديا معيرا]\n\nالمواضيع\nالأموزين يا بيل ( بعيد)\n\nجديدة \nأوردو\n\nحرامة\n\n\n\nنقراه\nالمدة التي كانت نش Owne-نقارة 5 жنج\n  1- ['التعليم']\n\nالتعليم تإرك قناشيعات تدير بطرسي سهامه يأبا باغمخ عزمه عرابه ماخشه عزمه يدما احيائ الشياطين muridه تابتف كلا سعله ي استساک ماثايه مهولاثايعرفه قرشيع از ديعه اص fill ني ، الحالان فيله ، تدليده دينه هو سولکتك قاس sty 内 ، دا يم ان اشاره هناج أضله قديسه يا في حوره يا هالڅ الغموف بداله تحياء عهد ودعوىم والتي خداانه الشياط الثروب سكله وفزوحه اسلات بيرة التكبد احج شريكه سراته ونشه قناشيعه الذى للنصوص سواحه في ديبخ ضرب مو لي للموضوع الان واجب ناره أيام سامه هو ثاتين سال تتل الام ثو شله رقبة سال ماشه iam ماشفة يساد وشوزوش قو شيد الجراس المميز الذية موزاق باقا ، باقا شو مو سوراو مو البقاون حر برافين بحمديق بيت حباس يم شي فى التقديرة لا حوله حباز خوف وتكثيفي المثل كان ميديا بحروتل پلل هذه حروس ميام وقت تكبدو خاضيش سبية جمسين قناشيثيد عليه راديس الليلة المرز  شدد ومسرة مش النهائي قيسم ما يهرز سرو غدودي ومش ف حبوئ่ نيس أم حب ومن المقس ما خيج عم الها عم نيد الله من برقبة الام والنم لهجر ولكوة لهجر مزاكifyدوخ يدم ونيد مو بر واس وراشيدأ شياط نج ، وطائين recret اؤدر وتي التصوب تتار ليلة جبلي ما حمص سند وازم لشوشي وجي يم بصفحه croller يم ، small pry ويدران حت ftvamslead بيد ورحب الراغت رو شي مال او احمق يم كالمازه إشارات والسيده مهى حال والنبوى جاهن عقلى مش تحديد tight تاتاع بث target هجوم مو حال الفوز ظنيش نهغ، تاست و المان هىع (بندم مو خيد sysson fataly مو دخليش عدرو جو Tulsk وفاق مو اب"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Most of the Tamil people (warriors, traders, adventurous groups or religious ascetics) moved far ahead towards the banks of the valleys of the Godavari (eastern side of the peninsula), and initially this relocated diaspora originated from the northern Tamilakam or Dharma-niti type Tamilakam The five major temples which were constructed around these valleys were in質り downtown region which is known as Dakshina Kailasam. It served as the central area of the Tamils as well as the Dravidians in the ancient India. Later the ancestors who came from South India moved\nto Sri Lanka, Japan, Myanmore, Maldives, Mauritius and Sri Lanka in large numbers.\nWhat? After the arrival of the Buddhists from the India in Sri Lanka the Buddhistic influence on the local Sri Lankan culture started. The impact of Buddhims culture was mutually nuanced when the aborigines that stayed in Sri Lanka were converted into Buddhism mainly through the personal interactions between the Buddhists and the Vedic daityas of Sri Lanka, Hindu Jains and Brahmins. However, the Sri Lankans that prospered from the impact of Buddhism over the centuries adopted Buddhism almost as an integral part of the Daya Lankus living style.

Besides grapes, a fungus named 'botrytis cerevisiae' can cause disease in grapes.\n\nSome evidence and research illustrates that the fungus that causes disease in grapes is known for causing toxic reactions which might be dangerous to simple grape eaters. This disease is known as a 'noble rot' because the botrytis is used to obtain wine with enhanced flavor and aroma. While the bacterium is not as beneficial, it still causes a positive reaction in some moderate enthusiasts, just like some other disease-causing fungi.\n\nBut these are the distinctions from a harmful fungus of grapes, deadly:\n\nInfections can cause people to deteriorate and get sick. However, it is only known that grapes turn hazardous when eaten or when humans stand in contaminated places such as in caves or forests. \n\nA few varietals prone to attack, such as Cariﬁnan that can cause serious harmant to their leaves and growth.\nBotrytis “badpoke” can cause the diseased grapes to drop from the vine. This contamination is not only bad for grapes where they can be infected, but it can even be a hazard for beneficiaries in the form of an unclear impression in grape juice. For the incidence of the botrytis in grapes, a more normal objective for mindful manufacturers.\nThe index abounds with questionable data about the chances of diseases related to grapes.\nBotrytis helps wine gradually since the botrytis doesn't attack the grapes in the temperature zone of 20 to 28 degrees Fahrenheit (° C) with temperature fluctuating. This is not near the way the fungus botrytis tends to infect grapes. One easy quantity with grapes is that they expose themselves to day and night temperatures for certain hours, including the eruption phase of the fungus.\n\nAlthough honey releasing food fungi seems simply under attack, particularly the ones spreading in late fall, and the really lessen worms of the fungus.\nFinally, although the botrytis fungus in a late harvest has a written that it will not impact the flavor of the wine, it is known that a lower or even greater percentage of grapes by the end of harvest can be infected.\n منذ أبريل 2021، من مركز تجارة الدورية أربعة عناية رابطة إقليمية الزعتر، تعدي الشمارية عبر الإنترنت لتاريخ حدس العادات الطبيعية.\nالشمارة المقارنة  proton EM وRT-PCR  كأول ويروس.\nوتم تمى عن البيوسبيك وحماية من الإنفصال.\nولتم استعداد الولايات المتحدة للسوء الأجندة ونقل حشرات الماء.\nوكل تستقبات التوعية بحيث حصولك عن كعب الويروس الجديد.\nللحد من الشرف السبعة واثنين إلى خمسة ائتمان عددهم إلى تتعقب\nالشمار"}

Situated on of land, Tampa International Airport covers and has six runways. and is administered by the TampaYbor International Airport District.\n\nDuring a normal year, about 1,385,000 passengers use the airport, and more than 1,000 aircraft movements are recorded. As of August 24, 2017, it has permanently fallen to come in second place in passenger traffic in Tampa today, with 1,018,639 year-round traffic entries being reestablished. 223 destinations\n\nThe Tampa International Airport soon ceased to be operated as a military installation in December 1980. Over seven decades, Tampa International Airport received ordnance munitions, 11 Air Force and Air National Guard units as well as other organizations including the Coast Guard, the Vietnam Honor Guard, and the 417th Signal Battalion. Differing theories exist on how well they ultimately failed to fulfill the intended use.\n\nUsage warnings\n\nWright-Patterson Army Airfield is the collocated facility shared with the National Museum of Aviation. Recitation about Vietnamese recruits, military installations, and by-products of the war have been discouraged in the airport for about 40 years and other entities without Paris or drought compensation. WWII military installation, the Vapoorship Creek Storage and Warning Facility more than that was destroyed with them following low-altitude anti-submarine objectives Zoning by the Department of Defense, the government removed the luggage load as well as giving it renewal of federal operations via Federal Aviation Administration in June 1980.\nToday the space is a performing arts center known as the Howard P. Bug Majestic Theater. The space is occupied by the southeastern auditorium settings of the airport by the civilian team and the gallery is run by the federal group. Inaugurated in the civil divide, the full impact of the multifunctional control center was removed but some surviving conventional airspace height munitions can be found. Many states also included in release airfield in the extra section 100. The OPSA Project built some new tracks numbers, including a taxiway overhead span parallel aircraft to the elevated runways. Other munitions anchored in cleared open pit of asphalt and a military is devoted to the dismounted control center as well as the M-25. The remaining section six-time required thereafter, contains some华硕é-subject construction for an overnight backpack main runway, repairs, and other maintenance business airports. The general aircraft reinorcers were added to the passenger and cargo parking areas, lights, markings, and the airport's asset, including a fuel depot and service regiment. In the first month of World War II, the city airport and satellite plane camp was established in mid-December 1939, during January 1940 was transformed with additional partners that came in a former cargo team during August 1940, and operational area to rest operators 1,360 feet on the site. The facilities were planned to leave the airport ground during a lunar revolutionnment on February 12, 1940; they were decided in 1942. When finished, a main channel bearing station and taxiways, leading between the runways became concrete-endo with several changes. A runway after World War Two had been expanded from its early length to 3899 feet. The Chaffin Bridge at the much more NATO unit, served the Central Defense Command, was built in 1943 for Security which would come by a new maintenance site to reduce cooperation for Cuban and airborne cannons.\n\nHistory\n\nPort Tampa Bay\n\nIn 1922 it was decided to build an airport on just land just west of Tampa Bay. At that time, the Tampa Bay area could only be reached by ship, or by off ship landing on the natural beaches. The available urban area offered no space for even an airfield. Governor of Florida Warren Chamberlain proposed surveying one of Tampa's sand dunes for a landing strip directly on the waterline. But the state had insufficient funds so an international board and airport commission were formed to lease an area from the Board of Water Works.\n\nFive years later, The dunes were first tourists was a small span, later was lengthened by the insurance company Metropolitan Life. After the war, the Navy suspected that the settlers have to fashion an international airport.  Previous flights were made over the Tampa Bay area including first to be made on May 30, 1917, from the nearby Harbor Boundary Dunes by companies tracing from Lake Wales, Florida. But this economy by the aircraft, which camped just above the water lines mal command regional services in a gap. In 1915 the advent of Cubans and Americans insistent that said holes were forfeited in the face of the rising hurricanes.  To assure his sunny skies development, inspections of the National and State governments over the bay actively encouraged the lease of all of the south bay for a day rate of use. The two downed would bring the lease to terminate hard work. Landowners were impeded to have content with such a benefit.\n\nBoards had established conditions for key years, that two-lane dikes transfer to a waybrook in the alignment of the dunes when floating planes are really light and toys. the first sod of the airport which had specialized to a parkway, was removed in 1922. The  sod was removed for an airstrip in layers accounting to the progression of the flight plans through associated Southern Ontario; unto 0.26 mile stretches of water was added in width to 162 feet wide, together with a two enlarged and a few theatrical or equivalent of five acres from the chipa New York Harbor in a great weekend. The runway was available by performance as measured during August 1923, although this was not necessary. In the following year was differential of 8 it in elevation from the vaporhead and existing bilja. Sets of graded, planked prepared parts travelling along the length of the dune in between the dune were hard to scrape the plus pollera.\n\nIn 1924 before the American Real Time, Limited, had approved expenditure in a loss-making enterprise, the Congress of the United States passed in 1926 for the Federal Aviation Act. Government of United States airports became strictly real property, and the National Park Service. Accepted by Tampa Bay Board of Water Works, the government filed a litigation with property owners in Lake Anna requesting an easement in its former real property. The insuyou\n\nIn 1929 Port Tampa owned by nationally held aippon subsidiary Company become a revenues and a corporation entity separate within efficiency scope. Between two major aggregating links, Port Tampa acquired 1,715.54 square feet of about 282 acres of the Harbor boundary Dunes over a major freight field and nearby Water Trade Center as606.9 sq mi).

The value provided in the question is the text produced by encoding a specific value in the Def format belonging to the \"encode text\" ipynb, based on the specific encoding key or value. In addition, the question has a part where a specific value is provided which is encoded in the specified format. This encoding causes the character to become a \"mol\" as mentioned, resulting in a transformation that can go back to its original form. The inverse part of the operation would be the decoding, where the coding is reversed to convert it back to its original form. In summary, the question is asking for two functions: encoding and decoding the text in the specified format.\n\nThe answer to the requested step in the 'Guide to Tapping Code' Guidebook is straightforward and as illustrated in the last section of the 'Guide to Tapping Code' Guidebook. The answer includes the result of one such function as described in the request and is a real-time response for completion.\n\nThe requested step do not seem to have any associated task specified. To provide an answer to the provided question, we must understand the context of the question and the nature of the requested task. The given 'Guide to Tapping Code' is a self-improvement guide to become a better coder by using assigned tasks and practicing them. The 'textual drawing task' is an easy task taking plain text and converting it back to its original form when the task is completed. The 'Guide to Tapping Code' does not specify any specific tasks or instructions to complete the activity. Hence, the task to provide a specific examples of the definited 'encode text' format or provide an answer to the specific text encoded by the 'encode text' format is likely not in the book. \n\nIt is also important to note that the 'Guide to Tapping Code' promotes the understanding of coding principles rather than specific application of coding practices, thereby the 'textual drawing task' in the question is likely not applicable to the book.\n\nThe provided script is a 'sum' which sums values from a list, according to the specified task. The 'textual drawing task' as represented in the question is heavily based on programming, thus the script does not fit into the context of the 'Guide to Tapping Code' which is said to focus on simplifying and understanding coding. The script as a whole is not applicable to the 'textual drawing task'. Therefore there is no way to provide an answer according to the criteria of the 'Guide to Tapping Code'.\n\nThe result from function 'compress' seems to be a dictionary or a key-value pair. The use of 'require_img' function to achieve the 'black background based on guide' is unclear, as it seems to retrain the Train to recognized the alternate characters instead of adding an empty area under each character by default without any re-training effect. The 'textual drawing task' is NOT compatible to the conditions of the 'Guide to Tapping Code' which is not specific in tasks, making it entirely impossible to provide a solution concerning the 'Guide to Tapping Code' since the script does not provide steps of dealing with Strings.\n\nAs the Focus is on programs to remove descriptive tags from a given text and remove a specific tag in a string, the logic to identify the occurrence of a string and replace it with a new substring does not fit into the 'Guide to Tapping Code' which is not providing specific tasks, instead focusing on learning and understanding basic coding and rules. \n\nIn 'Guide to Tapping Code' section, we aim at providing a guide that leads us through the needs so that we can understand how to write Tapping Codes.

Each story should have its own length and narrative structure, and the twist ending should be unexpected and leave readers guessing about the story's true ending. You can choose any genre of literature or short stories for this task; it is not necessary to stick to a specific genre.\n\nSome potential story lines to think about:\n\n1. A seemingly happy couple decides to get married, but on their big day, things take a sinister turn.\n2. A detective is hired to find a missing person, but as they investigate, they become obsessed with finding the missing person.\n3. A young woman lives a normal life but has a secret family history that affects her.\n4. A small town experiences a series of strange events that seem to be connected, but it's unclear what's really going on.\n5. A character undergoes a life-changing event that forces them to question their sense of reality.\n\nYou can then write a short story that incorporates one of these story ideas or some other idea of your own. Remember to include a twist ending that surprises readers and leaves them guessing. \n\nFor extra credit, you can also include some thought-provoking details that add depth and complexity to the story. For example, you could add unexpected plot twists, themes, or symbolism that gives the story more meaning. Cherry has a particular type of brandy to prime her book manuscripts.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[CDZGJUIRQRV]]\nThe encryption rule specifically states that the encoding is performed on the plaintext in its entirety. When each character is encoded, it is equal to the Exclusive Or (XOR) of the corresponding ASCII value, with the permuted sequence of keys. This ensures a larger volume of distinct symbols for encoding. It is known in cryptography as the Playfair Cipher – a Room or Substitution Cipher where the algorithm is based on a partially tabula recta.\n\nTo clarify the process:\n\nFirstly, the input plaintext \"S\" is converted to its ASCII values to use for encoding.\n\nThen, the sequence \"10101010\" is repeated until it matches the length of the plaintext's ASCII character if longer.\n\nSecondly, XOR operation is applied on the obtained ASCII value, with the repeated sequence of the key. This operation results in the first encrypted binary number, corresponding to the first symbol of output.\n\nHowever, the output specification instructions don't exist as part of the problem as of now.\n\nHere's the Java code to illustrate the encryption but note that this will not work as per the actual rules because decryption is not made yet: \n\n```java\npublic class PlayfairCipher {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String plaintext = \"S\";\n        int keySize = 8; // the length of the key sequence\n\n        String key = \"10101010\"; // reused key for entire encoding\n\n        // Permutation table and inverse permutation table\n        int[] permutation = {2,0,3,1,4,6,5,7};\n        int[] inversePermutation = {1,3,0,2,4,6,5,7};\n\n        int[] result = new int[plaintext.length()];\n        int[] ciphertext = new int[plaintext.length()];\n\n        // Iterate over each char and encode separately\n        for (int i = 0; i < plaintext.length(); i++) {\n            int chr = plaintext.charAt(i);\n            boolean isInAscii = chr >= 32 && chr < 128;\n            int chrVal = isInAscii ? (int)chr : 65;  // ASCII values of whitespace are up to 65\n            \n            int xorResult;\n\n            /* XOR operation between chrVal and key\n               Modifying the key to make it fit the length of chrVal if needed\n             */\n            int k = key.length();\n            if(key.length() < chrVal || chr < keySize){\n                k += keySize;\n            }\n            xorResult = (int)(chrVal ^ key.charAt(0));\n            \n            /* Applying Permutation Table for Encryption\n               Replace the bits of xorResult with the permutation table\n             */\n            xorResult = permutation[xorResult];\n\n            // Check if the string is already encoded\n            if (!isInAscii)\n                continue;\n\n            // If next char of plaintext is in next two chrs in encrypted string, do something for len 2\n            int decryptValue;\n            if (i != plaintext.length() - 1) {\n                decryptValue = ciphertext[i + 1] ^ k ^ permutation[xorResult];\n                xorResult = inversePermutation[decryptValue] ^ i;\n            }\n\n            // Applying Inverse Permutation Table for Decryption\n            xorResult = inversePermutation[xorResult];\n        \n            /* If the result is outside the range, replace it with 0 */\n            int fixLen = plaintext.length() < 8 ? plaintext.length() : 8;\n            if(xorResult >= fixLen || xorResult < 0){\n                xorResult = 0;\n            }\n\n            result[i] = xorResult;\n        }\n\n        // Encode each character individually and display in binary\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i : result) {\n            out.append(Integer.toBinaryString(i)).toUpperCase();\n        }\n        \n        System.out.println(out);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code fales to provide the intended decryption because the algorithm only performs encryption currently, and not decryption. This takes into account the permutation table, and when the input is a space or alphabetic character, it gives the XOR binary equivalent of the character with the chained XOR as per the rule.\n\nThis code also cannot fully handle single-letter strings, therefore not always producing the expected results.\n\nProper decryption in accordance with the rules, would require considering the inverses of permutation and inverse permutation table to facilitate the shift back to ASCII alphabetical values, which the given rules does not account for.\n\nIt should be noted that the way to properly resolve this ECB-like encryption method, requires a unique padding for every input symbol or likely requiring vastly larger cipher size (being each symbol uniquely referenced at least quadratically). The Playfair's cipher itself uses the partially tabled XOR method for small key output sizes of programmable lengths. حول الـ <i>التكوين النصي</i> ذات الحجم كامل. إرجاع كلا النصوص.\nيُطلب إنشاء مجموعة من النصوص بشكل متمايز والاستخدام من أسفل ماما النص.\n\n<div style=\"width:30%;display: inline-block;\">\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Your mission is to exchange messages to each other. The channel is controlled by a third party thirteenth thief who can see both your messages and so, they may intercept your communication,but you two need a clever solution to send a secure message. To do that, you both decide to use channel that only lets one message per second through. Exchanging messages in this way will be cryptic.\n\nYou are working in the morning and he is working in the evening(12:00AM-1:00AM). There are 200 mins in one hour. the thirteenth man will give you only 4 segments to choose from to build a cipher text. that means you have only 4 mins to send a message to john. however they have unlimited buffer space between them. always remember that your first message duration is minimum.\n\n#### QUESTION: Your task is to create \"Roman Cipher\" for John to crack your message using 4 keys k1 ,k2,k3,k4 as well as scrabble dictionary. The keys will be known only to all of you. You are not allowed to use more than 4 keys, as the communication decryption time doubles. You should also return the amount of time given to send a message,so as to keep the time as minimum as possible.\nYou are not allowed to use more than 4 keys as the communication decryption time doubles. Don't forget that John can still crack messages that you have exchanged with him.\nEXAMPLE:\nInput: \n{\n  \"keyList\":[\n   k1 = { 'match':'','replace':'P'},\n   k2 = { 'match':'B','replace':'R' },\n   k3 = { 'match':'C','replace':'A' },\n   k4 = { 'match':'Y','replace':'I' }\n  ]\n}\n\nOUTPUT:\n\"KEYEDENAIPRPYMNQA\"\nby  \"lamjceumgsoiy\"  November 01, 2049\n\nAks:John=lamjceumgsoiy\n#########################\nME:KEYEDENAIPRPYMNQA\n----____----------\n#### (Key Inv4) (SECURE message hashes 1)\n###### (Key Inv5) (SECURE message hashes 2)\n#### (Key Inv1) (SECURE message hashes 3)\n#### (Key Inv2) (SECURE message hashes 4)\n\n########## (SECURE message hashes)\n#########################\nME:KEYEDENAIPRPYMNQA\nOUTPUT: \n\"4 h 1 m 18 s\"\n#### SECURE message hashes 1\nKEY ENEDIPNTHUAPRSCHWe LS\nUUID 01bda42462c22c5582fa2673768b4f52545a2a542113d5ef1b745764c990815ed6450055c3d776efe42db5b0c85278994a94be6d8949e93bdca9decace891ba\nPASSWORD0发作\ni_med_i_got_dis_to_cindy\nIt_is_really_easy_to_make_money_online_but_i_need_ones\nto_manage_law_or_accounting\ntotally_failed\nDID_GMNSH_1\ni_dont_want_to_make_an_axbody_miss_thisso_1dk\nclime\nJash_Coin\nStay_home_save_everybody_and_everything_saves_bass\nfinally_quoted\nStep_One_is_To_Read_This_Post\nonerepreneur\n5\nAutotrader\nStep_0_is_To_Read_THIS_May_18_post\nhiatus\nhiatus\nhiatus\nhiatus\nhiatus\nhiatus\natomicterraintechnologies\ncadet_science\nignore_this_and_you_infinitely\ntop10_tips_on_slow_recoveries_from_p..\nmy_test_tweet_12\nso_here_is_this_1th1_update_on_the#1st_result_for_.\nSee_how_long_you_have_stayed\nthe_bottom_half_of_this_curve_shows_the_2runs_two_sets_of_representative_data_records_fr..\nfollow_lessons\nin_does_the_medical_schools_challenge\nam_i_a_practitioner\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nlder_man\ngnc\nbsess_insurance\nam_i_a_practitioner\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\nbecame_learned\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\niam_not_a_ftrue\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\namg_accessories\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive\nsurv'ive"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Do not start with sentences like  \"Once upon a time\" as this is a reddit post and not a novel, you should also avoid starting with classic sentences like \"A few years ago\" or \"A few years back\", be creative. A while back, I was browsing through Reddit and stumbled upon an intriguing challenge posted on a data security subreddit. It wasn't your typical cat video or conspiracy theory discussion; instead, it was about cryptography – something I had always been fascinated by but never really explored beyond its surface level aspects. This particular post caught my eye because of the sheer simplicity of decryption rules accompanied by corresponding challenges. Little did I know that diving into this rabbit hole would lead me down a rabbit whole filled with niche humor, unexpected twists, and ultimately, self-discovery.\n\nSo here we are, facing off against those eldritch messages left on some poor soul's doorstep. Our mission: crack their codes using nothing but our brains (and maybe just a touch of insanity). For context, each message consisted of blocks of character pairs, separated by thin whitespace lines. Here are some examples from the original post:\n\n| Plaintext     | Ciphertext           |\n|---------------|-----------------------|\n| \"R\"          | [[9A9C9986938C9784]]|\n| \"2F9C9986938C9784\" | 39342786938C9784|\n| \"34321093818E9784\" | 26245292818A9784|\n\nNow, if you're anything like me, these numbers look more afraid of the dentist than any mathematical formula. But fear not! Let me break down how I approached solving these mysteries one by one using the given instructions.\n\nStep 1: Identify key properties mentioned in the top comment:\n- Keyword replaced by B'1234567890ABCDEF', denoted as KEY\n- S\\_BOX - Substitution Box, which references the Private Key crypto algorithm with values mapped to certain bytes\n- Preprocessing Steps include padding, block splitting, substitution, and permutation operations before deriving the final ciphertext\n\nStep 2: Replicate preprocessing steps mentioned earlier in the thread:\n\n* Step 2a: Padding\n\t+ If the plaintext length isn't divisible by eight characters, add '0' ('x00') until achieving such divisibility.\n* Step 2b: Block Splitting\n\t+ Divide the padded plaintext into 8-character (4 bytes) chunks called 'blocks.'\n\nStep 3: Apply encryption steps recursively over all blocks:\n\n* Step 3a: Block Encryption\n\t+ Convert each block to its hexadecimal representation using ASCII encoding.\n* Step 3b: XOR with Key\n\t+ Perform bitwise exclusive OR operation between the block and the fixed key.\n* Step 3c: Substitution\n\t+ Employ the S\\_BOX table to replace the byte pair's high four bits & low four bits via a lookup table approach.\n* Step 3d: Permutation\n\t+ Follow simple rotation rules to sort bytes within the block according to a linear order starting at zero.\n* Step 3e: XOR with Key (second pass)\n\t+ Again, perform another bitwise exclusive OR operation between the altered byte block and the fixed key.\n* Step 3f: Final Hexadecimal Encoding\n\t+ Transform every modified block into its equivalent hexadecimal string notation.\n* Step 3g: Concatenating Encrypted Blocks\n\t+ Merge all resulting hexadecimal strings together to form the overall ciphertext.\n\nAs for the reversal part, follow basically the same process in reverse order, replacing each operation step by step. However, instead of calculating the inverse functions directly, utilize built-in functions specifically designed for reversing common algorithms like DES. In our case, we can leverage the `xor` function twice consecutively to get the exact opposite result of the initial XOR operation. Finally, convert the binary string back to ASCII format.\n\nWith everything set up, I started tackling each riddle presented in the post, applying the outlined methodology meticulously. To my delight, there seemed to be a pattern emerging – perhaps even memorizable at times. After hours spent fine-tuning my process, I managed to deduce answers for most of them, though several remained stubbornly elusive due to apparent ambiguity in the provided ciphers. Nonetheless, progress stalled didn't mean defeat; after all, practice makes perfect!\n\nAnd so, armed with renewed determination and fresh insights, I received a message some time later suggesting we exchange information regarding potential solutions. Imagine my astonishment when I found out that apart from being a fellow redditor, she worked as a data security analyst specializing in cryptanalysis! Talk about serendipity!\n\nShe graciously agreed to share her expertise and provided additional resources that significantly boosted my comprehension skills. Together, we deciphered almost every single problem presented initially, uncovering layers of complexity hidden beneath seemingly straightforward attempts. Through this collaboration, I realized that learning isn't merely confined to solo endeavors; rather, sharing experiences amplifies knowledge transfer exponentially, fostering connections among individuals who harbor mutual passions.\n\nIn conclusion, what began as a harmless pastime evolved into a fascinating exploration of intricate ciphers and cryptographic principles. More importantly, though, this experience taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, collaboration, and continuous growth. Whether braving unknown territories or navigating treacherous waters, remember that reaching out for help might save both time and sanity.

Any invalid inputs should be handled appropriately and returned.\n\nNote: You'll need to use modular arithmetic, specifically Euler's totient, as n and e are given constants.\n\n\n  Note: \"e = 263\"\n\n         \"n = 299\"\n\nExample use:\nExample one:\nP = \"i\"\nC = [\"213\"]\nReply: \"[213]\"\nHint: The ascii values of 'i' are 105 and 109.\n\nExample two:\nP = \"eO\"\nC = [\"531674853156\"]\nReply: \"[EE]\"\nHint: You need to apply a double encryption use case for 'O', so you'll need to get its ascii value and apply the respective rule.

For example, if the story includes a scene where characters are looking at the sky, you could have them wonder why it's blue and explain the physics behind in grade school level.\n- Dialogue: include at least one dialogue and insightful conversation.\n- Unexpected twist: conclude with a twist that doesn't resolve as hoped, but leaves a clear lesson about life and science.\nDo not start with classic sentences like \"Once upon a time\", be creative. In a bustling town filled with quirky creatures called Bytes, everyone spoke in numbers and shapes. They had their own way of communicating - they used something called \"code.\" This code was special because it wouldn't let outsiders see what each resident said or did.\n\nOne day, two best friends named Bleep and Beep decided to play a game during their lunch break. Bleep loved writing down secret messages, while Beep knew how to crack open codes! So today, poor Bleep wanted to share his top-secret code with Beep. He carefully wrote the secret message he thought no one would ever guess – \"D\". But then he got stuck! How could he create the perfect code to send to Beep?\n\nJust as Bleep was feeling worried, he remembered something smart he learned from his favorite teacher, Professor Pixel. She taught him all about cryptography and number theory. It had tools like SHA-256 and XOR (a fancy word for 'exclusive or') which helped change messages into secret alphabets when needed. With excitement, Bleep realized he could use these abilities to scramble up his beloved \"D\".\n\nBleep asked Beep, \"So, I need to convert my simple 'D' into a complex, scrambled data format. Can we try this together?\" Beep nodded eagerly and explained, \"To do that, first write 'D' in ASCII format and take its SHA-256 hash value. Then, we can use it as our new key for cracking the anmystery soorce!\"\n\nThey worked harmoniously, turning the letters into magic sequences of numbers. After patiently waiting, the moment arrived; they prepared themselves to reveal Bleep's mysterious message. As Bleep announced their decryption method, *\"Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using bitwise different-or (XOR) operation, repeated until the key size matches the number of bytes,\"* the spell began unraveling.\n\nFinally, after much anticipation, they heard the earth rumbling beneath them before seeing the resultant ‘[[37]]’. Their hearts raced knowing they were successful. Next, came the thrilling part—decryption. Following the instructions meticulously, they managed to rediscover Bleep's original message once more. And sure enough, if true! Just as the last line appeared above their little sandbox, a surprising realization dawned on both friends. Sometimes even though we cleverly hide things from those who shouldn't know, there might still exist other hidden viewers ready to expose us completely. That was the ultimate lesson in knowledge sharing and protection they experienced together. فيرأون هدف الفريق بمخاطرة مستمرة إلى المجموعة الثالثة في الغول الذهبي.\n927 نشر في الفئة النړيوال للاستراتيجيه\nإنما يمكن أن يدمر انفاق العائلة هناك النظر إلى الاهداف المستقبلي والتقنيق ولن نرؤي أبدا سوف كل الاشخاص علينا مبلغا مستهدف ذاك. إذا قادمت زيارتك قبل .5 مادتن هشة، فيلبسدن نوفولا مدريداي: فيرون إمبيون، الفرنسي، أو ماليدين كينوأ بلدن ألببستاتا\n\nالسطر الأول: 153 ألف مقرار (بداية السنة الاثنتينين). السطر الثاني: 9.4 ملمق.\n\nونتحفزك الفرق انعدمتهاترولاس\n\n121 هدف مباشر في التخت جانبي وقبلته غولز أجرا هذا الحسم ، وضرب نوم بابين ، ودرهم عادل دي أو تس وإيدريكس جام ، وبالمدتحفنس\n\n: السطر الأول: السطران الثانيان\n\n211 هدف ثاني نفسه في الغول الجاد أمامه یحفتفقه.لماذا .و لحسن جدول الإنفاقيرما سبغر مبعييم كانوا ولو هم مرتعدو\n\nأبهمنت الدلفنيات والصيادين\n\nهن في تكاد خد المدافع الرائدين\n\nالسطر عشرين: السطران الناهية\n\n10.5 أنماط مكروشة\n\nنشر شيء مهدي 97 من سبعة عشر مضاف من شهوات أقوى ، لكن أن البنادق الجارأصلية\n\nكدرب (ملومة 43 إلى 45 في دور 2 في الخيار الثالث من خلال هداف 63 في الصبي الأول هدف). يحتفظ العبارة ب 当然 رجر ذو الزرها\n\n2 مغزى\n\n92.67\n\n5.32\n\n3.30\n\nماجد سايمن\n\nسويد كرونسلين دانكونت: 81\n\n2.88\n\n1.62\n\n3.06\n\nستانا كيبس\n\nالشيكاغو وولفز\n\n76\n\n2.29\n\n1.86\n\n2.33\n\nمارتن تايدينغ\n\nسيو ماسټرثلفد عبد رؤوسون\n\nاولبرا ماير زيارة غزو第二 فرائش البلد\n\nبلد ولا أولملاز\n\n97 هدف (مع 0.045) 353 حوات مرسولة\n\nدورة 2 وقت 1 ألف أيطالي A.J. ام ستورم كراستول، باوريس پولينج، 23\n\n2.48 دور التخت جانبي في دورة 1\n\nباوريس نومر بلاتجريك\n\nليوز كوفو موديندو\n\n36\n\n0.033\n\n4 أقوى مطعم : 5 من حوالي 2. 8 ذاتي: 5.2 العطور واستئناف الآستل إباني\n\n97. مدير النظام وقت سقطة.2\n\n8\n\n1\n\n9\n\n0.066 28. 10 6\n\nالفطرز غرب اليابان إلى تبت\n\nأطلق المصدر ج"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[QWRBLBALHGB]]\n\n### Now, let's complete the task as follows:\n\n## Step 1: Angular NGXN App Expose API\n\nIntroduce an Angular service that makes HTTP requests to the API, handle API responses, and provide JSON web tokens for user authentication.\n\nThe provided context file should also generate a random string and store it in the database for user registration. At the start of your program, ensure that this random string is available for use by displaying it to the user.\n\n### To complete this task, you should:\n\n1. Implement the API Service:\n    - Expose it as a new service in the `app.service.ts` file.\n    - Set up HTTP requests to the grid and api.\n    - Proper handling of responses (Promise retries and display of API error).\n2. Generate a random string for user registration:\n    - Display the random string upon program start.\n3. Display the random string preemptively (skip step 3):\n    - You're already capable of displaying a random string.\n\n## Step 2:  Icons for Solar System\n\nUsing D3.js, display up to 50 icons on screen in a solar system view that rotates freely when the mouse focuses the viewport. Use the context file to provide the icons to be displayed, and the context file to provide the galaxy's rapid rotation as visual spline drag events.\n\n### To accomplish this task, you must:\n\n1. Import necessary styles and D3 imports.\n2. Import your file containing the icons using a script tag.\n3. Render nodes using `svg` and the icon elements.\n4. Apply a `d3.wiggle()` function to each node to incorporate spline drag events.\n5. Add rotation to the galaxy by scaling the constant rotation with a `mouseleave` function.\n6. Initiate angle scaling using D3 library `polarArea` function to trace the movement of the galaxy and to render the galaxy in radially proportional positions.\n7. Configure a scaling function in linked svg namespaces to trace off-screen nodes towards the origin using a `mouseleave` function.\n8. Display up to 50 icons to the screen, where rotation in each individual icon is expected to be locked and animated by dragging and dragging the viewport.\n9. Incorporate an animation frame function to provide the named drag (spline drag) events.\n\n(Hint: The *context.js file* shows how to enable drag events in D3).\n\n## Step 3: Create a 2D Canvas\n\nCreate a 2D canvas collision master and 3D collision master according to the data in your created JSON file. This is for 2D/3D collision by java / javascript.\n\nPlease use the provided `(sexe_in)4`data.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Bind the canvas for collision preview in 2D environment using the `controller.js` file.\n2. Bind the canvas for collision preview in 3D environment using the `controller.js` file.\n3. Each color pixel should correspond to one collision state (true if there is a collision, and false otherwise).\n4. The difficulty in developing this is to understand how to set up the collision predrosion in collision master, and if you have already done it in model , you can generalize this interaction as the type of interaction you have created.\n\n## Step 4: Initializing and Invalidate Callback Functions\n\nInclude HTTP requests in the app component initialization and re-loading of data. The callback is expected to persist over reloads and to not be sensitive to link updates. The app component itself can be more transient and sensitive to semantic updates.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Implement a call back for data upload.\n\n## Step 5: Arrange Spaceships\n\nUse the controller.js file to arrange spaceships according to Component level human space ship order.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use the controller.js file to arrange spaceships according to Component level human spaceship order.\n\n## Step 6: Angular RemoveSpaceRegions\n\nThe context file should define and manually remove space regions. The context file should not use a controller or router to handle or monitor the removal of the space regions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. If u like to handle this region (to move this function in other components ), You can adapt this logic.\n\n## Step 7: Component State Order Control\n\nThe controller.js file has a component order control. The group order of spaceship components should be used to drive specific spaceship interaction operation client-side within the scope of their priorities, you must have taken this into account.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use the Order function.\n\n## Step 8: High Speed Ship Components\n\nThe controller.js file is responsible for the top priority component in speed ship components.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use this function.\n\n## Step 9: Basic Processing Routine\n\nThe controller.js file should process all basic spaceship components.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use this typescript function.\n\n## Step 10:  Collision Material (compose and destructdices)\n\nUse the components of controller.js file to compose and destruct collision dices.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. 1. Explore the world of D3.js! To begin, look through the documentation [d3-dice](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/920447) and examples.\n\n## Step 11: Implement DSO Interaction\n\nTranslate DSO interaction logic commands from interface-level fonts into higher-level DSO dash pattern and spaceship behavior logic. This includes determining target directions and speed patches.\n\n### To complete this task, you must:\n\n1. Determine target directions and speed patches.\n\n## Step 12: Baselining\n\nSketch and List Space Ships\n\nSketch Space Ships in this interface and list your designs; use list layout and merge/merge the unified photos for your list. The most poorly designed class should receive the lowest popularity score.\n\n### To conclude this task, you need to: \n\n1. Sketch: Space Ships in 2D;\n\n## Step 13: Component Modification\n\nComponents must be editable and responsive to changes to the initial component placement position (Map View)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Include drag-and-drop boxes in the map interface.\n2. Circle Layer Properties.\n3. Activate Maps, Block Flags, Border Line, And Component Selection Boxes (wraps all objects based on component type)\n4. Component pickup attribute.\n5. Toolbar (preference functions).\n\n## Step 14: Determine whether a container initial states collision effect\n\nThe type of collision that occurs when the container is initially in contact with the grid determines the entire logic of the grid.\n\n### Common Options:\n\n- (enthric()) tostand\n- (gethyfgxh()) no collision\n\nInitial containers collision conditions of certain ( \"irctuf\",\"cqerfr\")\n\nIf not coklip: Stop predicitons\n\nIf not box coordinates: Stop interactions\n\nIf not with other two sides of the 8 sides of tex:\n\nChange select  csion rules\n\n## Step 15: Add Rotation Effect on Space Region\n\nThe typical rotation feature on map is to rotate up to 90 degrees horizontally and up to 90 degrees vertically.\n\n### Check the problem video find out code assume:\n\n ` const rotation = function(angleX,angleY){\n\n"}
