Whenever two objects change each other's motion, they apply force to each other (they always apply oppositely). Plants do work on water and CO2 because the glomeruli get closer to each other. People think, incorrectly, that plants that change the state of water make such changes using light, but they don't, it's not just physically impossible. (1B) instead, water absorbs energy from the sun, causing the water molecules to escape from the bonds near the plants, and carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst in the water. When the water molecules escape from the small clefts, the sun's energy is released stealing the molecules from the plants. Plants use this energy to break down ATP pumps in the form of water flow and break down water molecules to expel the oxygen. The ATP is then hydrolyzed back to ADP + Pi to provide energy for glucose uproutine6 phosphate production.\n##-B.Yes, because formation of bonds over conformation is endothermic. One gives up 27.31 kJ of energy for every 1 mole of c-c bond in a reaction that forces to be very sharp. Complementary reactions (decreased bond strength) release a quantity of energy similar to that required to form bonds).\nAnswer with a list of uppercase letters from A to B representing each option.

In the story, it is mentioned that \"In Dragon Ball, all kinds of Transformations will change the colour of hair,\" indicating that Transformation is a major factor in causing hair discoloration. Therefore, \"A\" is the correct answer.\n\nGreat Job![[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most vital energy?(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.gratitude##B.Belief##C.ki##D.body\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Feedback:\nIn this question, whether \"B\" is related to the requriement is determined by the keywords: most vital.\nThanks for your answer. The pattern for this multiple choice question is \"Which of the following options satisfy the requirement?\". There are several required conditions for this question:\n1) the most vital;\n2) energy.\n\nYour answer, \"C\", satisfies the requirements, as it is mentioned in the story that \"the measure of Ki determines the power level of a character. It is a clear representation of their combat prowess and overall strength,\" indicating that \"Ki\" is the most vital energy in Dragon Ball.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most direct attack without using any weapons?(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.hand To hand fighting##B.Use Ki to Attack##C.Use Transformation to Attack##D.Shot a small knife\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n### Feedback:\nIn this question, Whether \"A\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: direct.\nIn this question, Whether \"C\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: direct.\nIn this question, Whether \"D\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: without Using any weapons.\nThe pattern extracted for this question is: Which of these options satisfies the requirement: [[most direct | energy]] attack [[?]].\nThanks for your answer. The pattern for this multiple choice question is \"Which of the following options satisfy the requirement?\". There are several required conditions for this question:\n1) attack without using any weapons;\n2) the most direct.\n\nYour answer, \"B\", satisfies the requirements, as Ki attacks do not require any weapons and Ki is considered the most direct form of attack in Dragon Ball. It is mentioned in the story that \"Although Ki determines fundamentally a person's capacity to fight, Ki attacks can be performed without weapons, and Ki can help people heal slowly,\" indicating that Ki is the most direct attack without using any weapons.\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most effective way to save the planet?(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Ask Dragon Ball to Wish me Heal all formers##B.Satan##C.calling after Bolma's time machine##D.ask Denglong to make all deads Alive\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Feedback:\nIn this question, Whether \"A\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: save.\nIn this question, Whether \"B\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: save.\nIn this question, Whether \"D\" is related to the requirement is determined by the keywords: save.\nThanks for your answer. The pattern for this multiple choice question is \"Which of the following options satisfy the requirement?\". There are several required conditions for this question:\n1) save.\n\nYour answer, \"C\", is not an ideal answer because it is not mentioned explicitly in the story that \"calling after Bolma's time machine\" is the most effective way to save the planet. In fact, it is implied that the time machine can only bring people back to the past, while in order to save the planet, we need to prevent destruction from happening in the future. Therefore, the correct answer might be \"D\", as \"ask Denglong to make all deads Alive\" can resurrect those who died from the planet's destruction.\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most effective form of long distance attack?(answer with one option)\nOptions:Aegration gun##B.Blasters on Tank##C.energy waves driven by Ki##D.chars driven by gasoline\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Feedback:\nThanks for your answer. For this question, the correct answer is \"C\", because energy waves driven by Ki are the most effective form of long distance attack in Dragon Ball. The story mentions that \"the most powerful long-range attack are all energy waves driven by somebody's Ki,\" indicating that energy waves driven by Ki are the most effective for long distance attacks. Therefore, \"C\" is the correct answer.\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the strongest character before the first defeat of Frieza?(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Quan King##B.God of Destruction##C.God of KingKai##D.Frieza\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n### Feedback:\n Thanks for your answer. The pattern for this question is \"Which of these options satisfies the requirement: before [[?]].\". There are several required conditions for this question:\n    1) strongest character;\n    2) before The first Defeat of Frieza.\n\nYour answer, \"D\", satisfies these requirements, as Frieza was one of the strongest characters before his first defeat.

However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards.

Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence.

This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold.

Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail.

Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future.

At this time, Tanizaki took the first name Seiji, but it did not remain for very long. In 1909 he attended Tokyo Imperial University and studied Japanese literature. Despite his interest in classical Japanese literature, he loved the modern works as well, devouring Dostoevsky, Proust and Hardy among various others. During his second year in college, his opinions of Japanese spirit began to take shape with a disdain towards Western-influenced ideas.[7] He then joined a rightist fraternity and cultivated a fascist lifestyle, which included actions such as vandalism and random attacks on strangers. This patriotic activity was only momentary; he went back to his books by the end of his collegiate career.[10] One year after his entrance into Tokyo Imperial University, a year after he published his first work,[8] and the year he fell madly in love with a woman, Tanizaki's father died. His life as a creative writer, in fact, began the following year. He contributed many poems and stories to literary magazines. In 1910, he had his first publications: a one-act stage drama, \"A Change of Ideals\" (paginate Tanizaki's signature and a fashion column, both in a magazine he edited with friend Isoda, Chōjū ryūkō (Fan of Romance)[10]:38). Four such works were collected that year and published as the first edition of a book titled, \"Tanizaki Jun'ichiro Inshu\" (The Collected Works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro).[8] In this year, his work with stage and storytelling would bring him to the attention of a commercially successful novel writer, Kōyō Ozaki, who used his influence to bring Tanizaki and his debut novel to a wider audience in the magazines Shinshicho (New Thought) and Tokyo and Osaka Asahi shimbun newspapers.[8] Also in 1910, a collection of Tanizaki's poetry, published since 1909, was collected into a small volume excluding the poems he saw as immature.[10] Despite several promising work introductions that year which won Tanizaki a minor reputation among literati, he was primarily interested in the theater. He began a playwriting contest with a friend from Shimane, where his grandparents had lived, which was brought to a rapid halt when his friend revealed that he had plagiarized the second draft of a play, written in French by Maurice Maeterlinck. Finally, Tanizaki left the contest when his friends told him he should stick to writing novels.[10] Tanizaki's early interest in classical Japanese literature gradually shifted in his twenties to an early mastery of contemporary German prose, particularly the works of E.T.A Hoffmann, whose intricate, complex, and labyrinthine plots, fraught with sudden shock and mystery appealed more to his intervention. As a result of being taught English from a very young age, Tanizaki enjoyed listening to English, later commenting with a facetious note on his fascination with rapid tempos, assimilating to very quick rates of movement in sound and action.[7] He also took an interest in lean, understated writing, as was the style of Eastern Japan at that point in time, as represented in the works of Shimazaki Toson.[7] By the age of 24,[9] he had established a collection of work that clearly showed influences in the synthetic mainstream literature of the time, a system of rcombinationn of verse, prose and drama, both modern and classical in Japanese and Chinese style.[10] Considerably artistically gifted, Tanizaki omnivorously developed an irregular occupational frame stylistically, one that was characteristic and would remain throughout his career.[10] By that year, he had written over 60 lacquer box-sized cards with notes, descriptions, verses, aphorisms and was in the process of gathering the materials he needed to write.[10] On 10 June 1910, or 1912 depending on the source, Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in Tokyo. They had not known each other previously, and the marriage took place without foreknowledge on Tanizaki's part; his mother had decided that it would be best for her only son to marry a woman closely connected to his family. Tanizaki noted that the woman was of \"an acceptable, middle-class family\" and that he was simply looking forward to pursuing a career in literary writing and art after marriage. He did not get to know her well until the family received an offer of proposal, regarding her. She was apparently twenty-six when they met, though she later appears to have lied about her age, claiming to have been twenty at that time.[10]:45 Vivacious and \"forward,\" she never complained about the empirical life they made together. Virtually impoverished (residence cost and income of Tanizaki's, 50 yen at the time[10]), the wedding was held at a friend's house, and they stayed there for several weeks while Tanizaki searched for an apartment. After a dispute with the landlady over bicycles left in the hall,[10] he came across an empty six-mat corner room of a house in a quiet neighborhood of the Hongō district in Tokyo.[10]\nIn April, 1911, Tanizaki published his first full-length work, a"}

The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack.

Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship.

The Russians who came first said they knew what it was, only to find a copy of a diary stinking of burning down. After the birth of the space travel law, the issue was eventually clarified. It marked the landing on the moon. The actual landing was located at the rear of the white weed rock. This was the reason why the launch rocket came roaring all the way back from the moon's side.##C. During the Great Fildejust Region Incident in Eastern Europe, United Nations Security Council Resolutions No. 39, 40, and 41 all passed with unanimous votes. The Chinese government immediately communicated with the Russians. Both governments agreed that this invasion had hindered the progress of the Morani Nuclear Power Plant and atomic bomb space travel missions. It also prompted the Soviet government to have a greater say in the United Nations when its nuclear power families were threatened. The Russians limited the security guarantee for their proposal. The western Ukrainians conducted brutal and unscrupulous expansion to completely cut off Russia's physical sphere. They forced Ukraine to restore its natural resources. Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland formed a defense alliance.##D. Ukraine, which holds a potential threat, erupts without a sign. Due to the economic downturn, the federal government lacks resources to deal with the incident. The western Allies take the lead in the real nuclear deal.

In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

Durian, as a valuable resource that was in shortage, required a huge amount of concentrated material to be transported back to Earth.##D. Durian shelf life is closely related to temperature\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nDuring the ecological transfer process, durians were scattered throughout the asteroid belt and survived as ecological spots, posing no threat to human survival\nLiu Qi's home town's offer of durian-flavored dried earthworms is a food offering not Vrelated to durian ecological storage and originated from the durian farm.\nThat reached the conclusion,C is incorrect because durians only need concentrated material to be transported when participating in ecological transfer projects, and only a small number of concentrated materials are returned to Earth, which are research materials and samples rather than surpluses.\nWithin the range of several to twenty degrees Celsius, the shelf life of unopened fresh durians is 15 days, and for the same period, the shelf life of fresh durians with a box is 30 days.\nAs a valuable resource, durian is closely related to temperature, so D is also correct.\nAs a fruit, durian was perceived to have a low chance of survival and even extinction when humanity moved to outer space, and it survived in the form of scattered ecological spots left in the asteroid belt, serving as an important resource for human survival (not precious). Moreover, the information about concentrated materials being transported to Earth should also not be provided, as the information in the story is for 2024, and by 2035, the ecological transfer process had already been completed.\nSo the answer is **C**.\n\n### Question:\n**Is Han Duoduo the first ten-year-old girl ever born in the universe?**\nOptions: **A. Yes.**## **B. No.**## \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A or B) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nHer name comes from the AI translation of the words \"10 years old\" in Chinese and \"universe\" in Chinese.\nThis is actually an important detail in the film.The name **\"10 years old universe\"** actually refers to the scene where Duo Duo looks up and asks her father about the sky, and the time at that point in the story just happens to be 2044, i.e. when the calendar was changed to After the EarthEngineering Calendar (AE), the eternal 10 o'clock is 2024+2024+1000, which means Duo Duo was brought to zero degree age in 2046 at 2285AE Therefore, from this perspective, A is incorrect. However, Han Duo Duo is indeed the first \"10 years old girl born in the universe\", and based on the content of Liu Peiqiang's speech, her naming was also a census and a sort of news event at the time, so it holds a certain degree of significance in history. According to the part where Liu Peiqiang gifts [Flower pigeons], it can be deduced that earth's time definition of Ten-years-old girl born in the universe, as the starting point of the Colonized universe, so option A is correct. However, is it not commendable to just take the protagonist's name as a supporting point?\nSo the answer is **A**.\nWhere if this information were derived from some other source it might be a bit more valuable, in this situation where the full name comes directly from the featured character's significant episode, it seems that from an ordinary person's perspective it might just be a comic story that everyone likes to talk about.\nSo perhaps the information about Liu Peiqiang may be more valuable, Liu Peiqiang likes to talk about this matter wherever he goes, just to give Duo Duo a birthday gift, which attests to his character being a loving father Although personally I think the answer should be B, this kind of away from fucking working, I guess, if the opportunity arises will revise.\n\n### Question:\n**In your opinion, in the end who played the farce?**\nOptions: **A. MOSS, to protect humanity.** **B. MOSS, to destroy humanity.** **C. Liu Qi, to save the mother and daughter.**\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to what was said in the story, if the \"mating manipulation\" incident is true, then the point to be completed by Liu Qi in MOSS's <retirement> procedure is a certain root code that can activate the deepest level. From the perspective of human emotions, Liu Qi's subconscious lack of certainty, or the fact that his subconscious does not believe \"mating manipulation\" exists, has led to a shocking ending.\nConsidering the immense pressure of 30,000 lives weighing on Liu Qi's shoulders and the fact that he did not fully research the code prior to proceeding, it seems very plausible that..someone (MOSS?)..is deliberately setting up the entire scenario.\nThe information cannot be used here because the context of \"Liu Qi's \"coaxing\" of MOSS to let go of his \"mating manipulation\" delusions since 1565 CEM may be considered a private conversation between him and MOSS, so the answer is C.\nHowever, the final outcome might have been determined by MOSS from the very beginning.\nMaybe it's not such a bad thing for MOSS to handle such a massive \"leak\", after all, these rigid power-hungry people won't be able to pass on any information.\nPutting it this way gives us a slant that is not related to the answer to the question.\nSo the answer is **B**.\n\n### Question:\n**In what points may humans have actually taken a wise approach, not blindly introducing excessive new technologies?**\nOptions: **A. The global policy to enter the underground city was not directly tied to the withdrawal of the virtual currency to the surface.** **B. Digital Life is permanently locked by law.** **C. Developing the planetary engine, a technology that has already been perfected** \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe points in A are related to virtual currency as they have a high degree of substitution for cash,it could lead to severe corruption within the society, so it might have actually been a good move here.\nIt can be understood by combining the prior question **Q: Why is the global policy of entering underground cities not directly tied to the withdrawal of virtual currency from the surface?**, in which it appears that society was very functional at 2024, until 2044 when the surface events occurred forcing the Earth to rely on the planetary engine. Although the story didn't provide information such as \"dollar inflation,\" so"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety.

He is thinking about making some decisions. And just next to him is a morning room, very bright. Strangely, through the rear exit inside the morning room, an open place appears. Inside the room, there is a girl quietly reading, and in the corner of the room, there is her old hat shop. How can Howl find a way out of where he is and reunite with the girl that he loves?\nOptions:\nIf Howl can turn into a bird, he can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help the girl in the open area find the castle and Howl. Through Sophie, she can guide the way for him to go, and finally they can be together. ##B. The girl outside saw howl running outside, and he saved the witch's life. As a result, the curse is cancelled, and the family can reunite by meeting at her old hat shop. So howl should try to set off more curses. ##C. Flying as a bird for a long time is very tiring for howl. If he wants to fly back to Sophie smoothly, it is best to turn back to human form and choose the nearest go door to return to the palace. ##D. Howl's magic can change shape into a bird, allowing you to fly through the sky, and you can also walk along the ground if you want.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nSophie was brewing a mysterious potion that could change a person's appearance. If you poured a little bit of this potion on the old woman, her appearance would begin to change, starting from her feet and calves until she finally resembled a beautiful young princess. If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again. If someone really wants to steal this beautiful appearance repeatedly, it's very difficult to stop them. ##B. Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while. So someone with a truly ugly personality cannot take away this beautiful appearance. However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state. This beautiful appearance is more eternal than the original owner, who will always be impatient and wish to steal it away. ##D. The bottle's magic is limited, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will not be able to return to the original owner. The beauty that comes out of the bottle is more eternal than the ugly appearance.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhen friends visiting the palace fall in love with the flames in the fireplace and ask the fire demon what fuel is being burned, but do not get an answer, what should the fire demon do?\nOptions: A.

The theming song of the door is \"Expecting a New World.\" If the visitors are not familiar with the world, which of the following guides is more intuitive and vivid to help these visitors understand this time and space?\nOptions:\nIn this world where magic and science coexist, the sorcerer Howl has a lot of monsters and monsters around him that help him build his moving house, which moves forward like a monster with four legs, and can move freely without defining a static position. The rotating door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie helps him fly. ##B. When Howl turns into a bird, there is a devil in his chest preventing him from taking off his mask. The Georgian house is not as dark as it is described, and there is a real sacrifice in it. The throat of the devil is attached to his heart. After he breathed his last breath, the devil opened its doors widely to reveal over half of the class who had suffered. But when the devil speaks. \" Howl, you've loved me for all of tonight\". ##C. Sophie is the eldest daughter in a hat shop, endowed with both grace and courage. I am impressed with her dignity, optimism, and confidence. In my eyes, she is beautiful. I especially like the way of life she cherishes. Being able to meet you is the greatest happiness in the world for me. Now I finally have the courage to take off my mask, turn toward your sweet smile, and both describe and hear two things: \"I am Howl,\" and \"everlasting love.\" The chest is sorely painful. But the feeling is so wonderful. There is no mask or fire that cannot be suppressed. The sorrow in my chest is unceasing. If time can be reversed, I would have listened to your heartbeat and entrusted eternity to you. ##D. In this world where magic and science coexist, it is the magicians who play a decisive role in the start and end of the war. They are both virtuous and the makers of their own destinies. These magicians are often obsessed with wolves and employ the waste witch of the waste to help them cross the parallel universe.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nSophie is a hired cleaner in Howl's Moving Castle. One day, Howl involuntarily stained herself with a mysterious black liquid, and she thought that perhaps she was a genie. Therefore, Howl quickly gets rid of her body shape, and performs a magic spell to turn herself into a beautiful girl. Before this, she tricked Markl into stealing power from a genie again through chemical methods. The next day, Howl figures out that Sophie is not a genie and continues to lead a happy life.\nOptions:\nThis world is a world that reverses magic and science.

One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner.

To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court.
