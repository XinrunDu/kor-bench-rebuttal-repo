Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n\t* The given ciphertext is \"11010001\". Since each chunk represents an encrypted character, I'll split it into 8-bit chunks:\n\n\t\t- Chunk 1: 11010001\n\t\t- Chunk 2: 01101100\n2.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"4\", I'll follow the decryption rules.\n\n**Preparation:** e = 263, n = 299\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. For each number c in the ciphertext: c = 4\n2. Calculate z = c^e mod n: z = 4^263 mod 299 = ?\n3. Based on the decimal number represented by z, use the ascii code to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n\nI don't need to perform the modulo operation here since 4^263 mod 299 is a straightforward calculation. Temporarily ignoring the modulo operation, I'll calculate:\n\n4^263 = (4^3)^88 × 4 = 4096 × 88 (×4)\n\nNow, I need to find the ASCII code corresponding to the decimal number 4096 × 88 × 4. According to the ASCII table, the 88th letter (after 'X') is 'X', and 4096 × 4 = 16580 is beyond the standard ASCII range. Since the calculation is still valid within the modulo 299 scope, I'll find the corresponding letter:\n\n16580 % 299 = 224\n\nThe 24th letter after 'X' in the ASCII table is 'V'.\n\n**Final Plaintext:** [[V]]"}
