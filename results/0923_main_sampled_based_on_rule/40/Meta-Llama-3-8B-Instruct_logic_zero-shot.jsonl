Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "After applying the logical operations and checking the truth assignments, I obtained the following results:\n\n(1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\nThis formula can be simplified using the distributive property of negation over conjunction:\n~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \u2261 ~(p1=::>p2) & p2\nWe know that only \u2713|x is a false assignment for the implication p1=::>p2. Therefore:\n(\u2713|x) \u2192 ~p1=::>p2 false\nand:\nx|x \u2192 p1=::>p2 true\n Combining these results:\n(p1=::>p2 true) \u2192 (p1=::>p2 true)\nWhich means the simplified formula:\n~(p1=::>p2)&p2\nis also true under all assignments. Therefore, this formula is a [[A]] Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\nThis formula can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures:\n(p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \u2261 (p1&~p1)&(p3&~p2)\nUsing the distributive property of negation over conjunction:\n=p\u2262=p=False /Nullable.\n FALSE (.......,REF<a>(\"#');?></...></a></null:])\n('f'(/a/\"a/1(02)))></null:])\nEXPASS/>.\n(({{true}} Extremely;\nASpas[SAspNet>\");\n1}\uff09\u3002));\u00e1cesegueuest \ubd10\ub974);;\n})) and ]()));  aussi us against internet anger))) as));\n(pow ))\nAdd-utils \u00e0) 1)    \u30c9s r\nWe know that only a proposition and proposition constants can be a Level A Formula.

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes.

The double arrow direction, which indicates bi-directionality, is not used in this sentence.\n* The category of Declarations is not applicable here, as the sentence does not involve changing the state of reality through the speech act itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[B.

Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx).

It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nIf Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast, then he will spend a long time online. Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

IllTrans Method\n\nThe given reasoning is invalid because it attempts to infer the antecedent (Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast) from the consequent (he will spend a long time online). This is a classic example of an incorrect transformation, where the conclusion is drawn by reversing the order of the implication. This is exactly the type of error described in the IllTrans Method rule."}
