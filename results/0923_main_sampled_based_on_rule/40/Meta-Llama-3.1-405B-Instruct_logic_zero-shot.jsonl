Examples in the given formula are p1, p2, and p3.\n\n2. **Level B Formula**: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas. The formula ~p1 can be considered Level B because it involves a single logical operation (negation) on a Level A formula.\n\n3. **Level C Formula and Beyond**: Formulas containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula. The formula ~p1&p2 involves two operations (negation and conjunction), making it at least Level C.\n\nGiven the structure of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3:\n\n- **~p1** is Level B due to the single negation operation on a Level A formula.\n- **~p1&p2** becomes Level C because it combines a Level B formula (~p1) with a Level A formula (p2) using the conjunction (&) operator.\n- **(~p1&p2)=::>p3** then becomes a higher level because it combines a Level C formula (~p1&p2) with a Level A formula (p3) using the implication (=::>) operator.\n\nFollowing the provided analogy and since we are already at Level C with ~p1&p2, adding another operation (=::>) to connect it with p3 would elevate it beyond Level C. However, since we do not have explicit levels defined beyond C in the instructions for such combinations, but are told to follow by analogy and use Z+n for classifications higher than Z, we must reason based on the pattern provided:\n\n- Level A to B adds a logical operation.\n- Level B to C adds another layer of operation.\n\nThus, every additional layer of operation increases the level. Since we've added an operation beyond what's explicitly defined as Level C, and without specific guidance for every step beyond C but before Z, and considering we don't jump directly to Z without passing through the alphabet logically, we need to fill in the gaps by progression:\n\n- Level D would involve another operation beyond Level C.\n- Given the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3 involves an implication on top of conjunction and negation, it's at least one level beyond Level C.\n\nSo, logically, this would be at **Level D** if we follow the pattern of increasing complexity with each level.\n\nThe answer is: **[[D]]**"}

However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true).

Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the type of each formula, let's analyze them step by step according to the given rules and logical principles.\n\n### (1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n\nTo determine if this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze its components.\n\n- The formula `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true (`✓`) and `p2` is false (`x`), i.e., `✓|x`.\n- The negation `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true (`✓`) in the case where `p1=::>p2` is false, i.e., `✓|x`, and false (`x`) otherwise.\n- When we combine `~(p1=::>p2)` with `p2` using `&`, we're looking for cases where both are true. Since `~(p1=::>p2)` is true only in the `✓|x` scenario for `p1|p2`, combining it with `p2` (which is `x` in that scenario) results in a false (`x`) outcome for `~(p1=::>p2)&p2` in all scenarios because `p2` being `x` makes the `&` operation false.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this analysis overlooks the fact that `~(p1=::>p2)` can also be true in other scenarios where `p1=::>p2` is false, but given our scenario, the combination with `p2` being true (`✓`) is what we're focusing on. The mistake here is in prematurely concluding the outcome without considering all truth values for `p1` and `p2`.\n\nCorrecting this:\n\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` is true whenever `p1=::>p2` is false. This occurs not just when `p1` is true and `p2` is false but also needs to consider the implication's truth table.\n- `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Thus, its negation `~(p1=::>p2)` is true in this case.\n- However, since we're combining this with `p2` using `&`, we need `p2` to be true for the whole expression to be true. This creates a contradiction with our initial condition for `~(p1=::>p2)` being true based solely on the implication's falseness.\n\nThe correct way to view this:\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true if `p1` is true and `p2` is false, but since we're also requiring `p2` to be true (`&p2`), this specific scenario actually doesn't fulfill the formula's requirement.\n- However, if `p1` is false, `~(p1=::>p2)` can still be true because a false `p1` makes `p1=::>p2` true regardless of `p2`, but adding `p2` being true makes the whole expression dependent on `p2`'s truth.\n\nGiven this, the formula can actually be true under certain conditions (e.g., when `p1` is false and `p2` is true, the first part `~(p1=::>p2)` can be true because `p1=::>p2` would be true due to `p1` being false making the implication true, but then `&p2` also being true fulfills the whole expression). Therefore, it's not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula because it's not always true or always false under all assignments.\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nThis formula suggests an equivalence between `p1&p3` and `~p1&~p2`.\n\n- For `p1&p3` to be true, both `p1` and `p3` must be true.\n- For `~p1&~p2` to be true, both `p1` and `p2` must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, the formula cannot be true under all assignments because the truth of `p1` is contradictory between the two sides of the equivalence. If `p1` is true (to satisfy `p1&p3`), then `~p1` is false, making `~p1&~p2` false. Similarly, if `p1` is false (to satisfy `~p1&~p2`), then `p1&p3` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, this formula is not a Truth Formula because it cannot be true under all assignments due to the direct contradiction in the truth value of `p1` required by each side of the equivalence. However, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because we're looking at the structure and not evaluating all possible truth assignments directly in this explanation. The correct approach would involve a truth table analysis for a more precise determination, but given the explanation, we see it's not always true, suggesting it's not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, reflecting further, given the direct contradiction in conditions for `p1` to satisfy both sides of the equivalence simultaneously, it indicates the formula cannot be satisfied under any condition, suggesting it leans towards being a Falsehood Formula. This is because for the formula to be true, `p1` must both be true (for `p1&p3`) and false (for `~p1&~p2`) at the same time, which is impossible.\n\n### Corrected Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical contradiction in the conditions required for each formula to be true under all assignments:\n\n- (1) is **Neither** a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it can be true under specific conditions but not all.\n- (2) is actually a **Falsehood Formula** because it presents a logical contradiction that cannot be resolved under any truth assignment, making it impossible to be true under any condition.\n\n**Answer:** [[C];[B]]"}

First, let's expand the implication `>` into its equivalent form using rule (10) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`.\n   - So, `(p>q)` becomes `!p | q` and `(p>r)` becomes `!p | r`.\n   - Thus, `((p>q)&(p>r))` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   \n2. Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3. However, we can simplify our approach by directly considering what it means for two propositions not to be equivalent. This implies that either one is true when the other is false, or vice versa. This can be intuitively understood as an XOR operation, but let's stick to the given logical operators.\n\n4. The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity. The second equivalence, upon intuitive understanding and partial logical breakdown, seems plausible but requires a detailed step-by-step logical transformation to confirm its absolute validity according to the given rules.\n\nTherefore, without completing the exhaustive logical transformations for the second part but recognizing the misalignment in the first, the preliminary assessment would suggest:\n\n**Answer:** [B];[A]\n\nPlease note, this response follows the analysis but might benefit from further detailed breakdowns for absolute logical confirmation, especially for the second equivalence."}

Given the constraints, this could potentially hold, but considering the original statements and the unique truth value condition, it's not feasible.\n\n### (6) Simplifying B3&C2&D1:\nB3&C2&D1 = (p&!q) & ((p&q)|(!p&!q)) & (!q&!r)  \nThis simplifies in the same vein as the others, resulting in an expression that cannot hold true under the given constraints.\n\n### (7) Simplifying E:\nGiven the simplifications above and considering the constraints that exactly one of p, q, r is true, and the other two are false, E simplifies to an expression that represents the only feasible scenario under the given conditions.\n\nHowever, due to the structure of the provided logical expressions and the instructions, the detailed step-by-step simplification process for E based on the given parts does not straightforwardly lead to a simple final expression without considering the specific constraints on p, q, and r's truth values. Each part's simplification process demonstrates that most combinations are impossible under the condition that only one of p, q, or r can be true, making a direct logical simplification of E based on these parts challenging without further assumptions.\n\nGiven the instructions and the aim for a specific format in the answer, and acknowledging that the detailed simplifications provided do not directly lead to a final, simplified expression for E that fits within the constraints of the problem as described, the following response adheres to the required format but highlights the complexity and the need for further logical analysis under the given constraints:\n\n[[B1&C2&D3 ::=:: 0]; \n[B1&C3&D2 ::=:: !p&q]; \n[B2&C1&D3 ::=:: 0]; \n[B2&C3&D1 ::=:: 0]; \n[B3&C1&D2 ::=:: p&!q]; \n[B3&C2&D1 ::=:: 0]; \n[E ::=:: E]].\n\nNote: The simplifications to '0' indicate that under the given constraints and the logical rules provided, these combinations cannot hold true. The simplification of E remains as E due to the complexity and the constraints provided, indicating that a direct simplification based on the given parts does not lead to a clear, simple logical expression without further context or logical reduction."}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "## Step 1: Analyzing the final logical expression E\nThe final logical expression E is given by E::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r). This expression is a disjunction of two conjunctions, each involving the propositions p, q, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the constraints on p, q, and r\nIt is given that exactly one of p, q, and r is true, and the other two are false. This implies that we have three possible scenarios: (1) p is true, q and r are false; (2) q is true, p and r are false; (3) r is true, p and q are false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating the first disjunct of E\nThe first disjunct of E is !p&q&!r. For this expression to be true, we need p to be false, q to be true, and r to be false. This corresponds to scenario (2) above.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the second disjunct of E\nThe second disjunct of E is p&!q&r. For this expression to be true, we need p to be true, q to be false, and r to be true. However, this does not correspond to any of the scenarios above, since it requires two propositions to be true, which is not allowed.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the first disjunct of E is true, which implies that Professor Wang is from Shanghai (since q is true).\n\n## Step 6: Determining who got everything right, half right, and everything wrong\nBy comparing the statements of each person with the true values of p, q, and r, we can determine that Person A got everything right, Person C got half right (since they correctly stated that Professor Wang is not from Hangzhou), and Person B got everything wrong.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Shanghai; A; C; B]}$"}

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001.

The literals are p, q, ¬q, ¬p, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\nTo apply the resolution algorithm, we start by initializing S0 as an empty set, S1 as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given expression, and S2 as an empty set. Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause. Therefore, we conclude that the algorithm iterates 1 cycle to reach the determination of \"Plausible\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Plausible;1]}$"}

The proposition that \"only 2 is a prime number\" can be broken down into two parts: \"2 is a prime number\" and \"no other number is prime.\" However, the direct translation of \"only 2 is a prime number\" into first-order logic using the given predicates is not straightforward because it involves an implication that if anything is prime, it must be 2, and nothing else is prime. But given the unary predicate F(x) and the need to use 0-ary predicates, the direct translation of the entire statement including \"4 is a composite number\" with the given instructions seems to misunderstand the typical use of predicates and quantifiers in first-order logic for such specific statements.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions and use 0-ary predicates for the statement about prime and composite numbers as closely as possible, we recognize that the statement essentially asserts two 0-ary predicates when considering \"2 is a prime number\" as F(2) and \"4 is a composite number\" as C. The \"only\" part is tricky without quantifiers directly applied to a range of values. The closest representation under these constraints would be to assert F(2) & C, understanding that \"only\" is not directly quantifiable in this format without a more complex logical structure that would typically involve quantifiers over a domain.\n\nFor (2): \"If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\"\nUsing the binary predicate G(x, y): x > y, the proposition can be symbolized by instantiating the predicate with the given numbers: G(5, 4) ⇒ G(4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the symbolization in the requested format is:\n\n[F(2) & C; G(5, 4) ⇒ G(4, 6)]."}

Given H(x) denotes \"x has been to Jupiter,\" we express the idea that for all x, x has not been to Jupiter, using the universal quantifier and negation, which symbolizes as Ax∼H(x).\n\n### Proposition 4:\nStudents studying in the United States are not necessarily Asian. Given F(x) denotes \"x studies in the United States\" and G(x) denotes \"x is Asian,\" we express the idea that if x studies in the United States, it does not necessarily imply x is Asian, using implication and negation, but since it's about the relationship not being necessary (or always true), we use the existential quantifier to show there are exceptions, which symbolizes the idea as Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x)). However, upon closer inspection, the correct interpretation should reflect that not all students in the U.S. are Asian, which aligns more with a universal statement followed by an existential condition but is better captured by stating there exists an exception to the rule that all students in the U.S. are Asian, hence Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x)) or more directly addressing the original intent with Ax(F(x) ⇒ ∼G(x)) being too strong, suggesting instead that it's known not all U.S. students are Asian, thus Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x)) captures the essence of \"not necessarily\" in this context.\n\nHowever, reconsidering for clarity and correctness in logical representation:\n- Proposition 4 should indeed suggest that it is not the case that all students in the U.S. are Asian, which can be more accurately captured by stating there are students in the U.S. who are not Asian, thus Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x)) correctly represents this.\n\nTherefore, the symbolized propositions are:\nAx(M(x) ⇒ F(x)); ExG(x); Ax∼H(x); Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x)).\n\nThe final answer is: [Ax(M(x) ⇒ F(x)); ExG(x); Ax∼H(x); Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x))]."}

However, Method A alone does not fully capture the transformation, as it does not account for the exchange of the subject and predicate positions.\n\nNext, we see that the subject (\"true revolutionaries\") and the predicate (\"upright and open\") in the original proposition are exchanged in the inferred proposition, which aligns with the definition of conversion in Method B. However, Method B is not directly applicable here because the original proposition is a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A), and Method B's definition does not exactly match the transformation from A to the inferred proposition's form.\n\nFinally, considering Method C, which involves performing obversion first and then conversion, we see that it perfectly matches our transformation:\n\n1. Obversion of \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" gives us \"All true revolutionaries are not non-upright and open.\"\n2. Conversion of this obverted proposition exchanges the subject and predicate, resulting in \"All non-upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" which is equivalent to the inferred proposition when accounting for the nuances of negation and predicate contrary.\n\nTherefore, the method used for this inference is Method C, as it involves both changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary (obversion) and then exchanging the subject and predicate (conversion).\n\n### Answer: [[C]]"}

However, the statement is about a fire, so we need to adjust our understanding. Given the context, we'll interpret p as \"there is life in a fire\" for this specific question. The statement \"There must be either life or no life in a fire\" implies necessity and is an either-or situation, which can be represented using disjunction and necessity. So, it is symbolized as #(p - !p).\n\n### Step 2: Symbolize the second proposition.\nHere, p denotes \"Li Ming plays well\" and q denotes \"he wins the championship\". The statement \"If Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship\" is a conditional statement involving possibility.

This can be symbolized as ‽q, where q represents \"collisions in movies\".\n\nTherefore, the entire proposition can be symbolized by combining these two expressions.

This means `∀i ∈ G, B_ip`.\n\nHowever, since Alice (`A`) is a member of `G` and she doubts `p`, we have:\n- `H_Ap`, which by the \"Introduction of Doubt\" axiom implies `¬B_Ap`.\n\nCombining these, we can express the situation as:\n- `G_p ∧ ∃i ∈ G, H_ip`, specifically for Alice, this becomes `G_p ∧ H_Ap`.\n\nGiven the structure of the logic and the specific question about the format, it seems we are to encapsulate our logical expressions within double square brackets `[[ ]]` for our final answer. However, since the question specifically asks for the logical expression according to the definition of consensus but with the added information of Alice's doubt, we'll focus on encapsulating the essence of the common belief (`G_p`) intersecting with Alice's doubt (`H_Ap`), which isn't directly asked to be transformed into a specific axiom or further simplified expression.\n\nThus, considering the structure of logic provided and the specific question, we aim to encapsulate the essence of the scenario described:\n\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`\n\nThis expression reflects the common belief in `p` within the group `G` (`G_p`) and the specific instance of Alice doubting `p` (`H_Ap`), aligning with the provided logical framework and addressing the question's request for a logical expression according to the definition of consensus in the context of the given scenario.\n\n### Answer:\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`"}

The scenario doesn't directly fit this description because it focuses on the difference in outcomes (wound healing speed) based on a single variable (presence of salivary glands), not on multiple varying conditions.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This seems to fit the scenario because faster wound healing (P) occurs when salivary glands (S) are present and does not occur (or occurs at a slower rate) when salivary glands are absent.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent, with varying other conditions. While the scenario has elements of this (presence of salivary glands leading to faster healing, and absence leading to slower healing), the \"varying other conditions\" aspect isn't explicitly explored in the scenario as described.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. While the scenario does involve a change in condition (presence vs. absence of salivary glands) leading to a change in outcome (healing speed), this method typically implies a range of variations or a gradient of changes, which isn't the focus here.\n\n- **Method ⚘**: This involves known causal relationships between multiple factors, which isn't the focus of the given scenario.\n\nGiven the information, the scenario best fits **Method ؆** because it involves a condition (presence of salivary glands) that when present leads to an outcome (faster wound healing), and when absent leads to a different outcome (slower wound healing).\n\n[[B]]"}

This suggests a potential causal relationship between uranium and radioactivity.\n   \n2. **Removal of Uranium and Continued Radioactivity**: After extracting uranium, the remaining samples showed even higher levels of radioactivity than pure uranium. This indicates that the radioactivity cannot be solely attributed to uranium.\n\n3. **Discovery of New Elements (Radium and Polonium)**: Further research led to the isolation of radium and polonium from the leachate, which were identified as the sources of the remaining radioactivity.\n\nNow, let's examine which of the methods aligns with the causal derivation described:\n\n- **Method ⸮** involves multiple instances where S and P occur together under varying conditions. While uranium and radioactivity initially seem to fit this pattern, the discovery of radium and polonium complicates this, as they also contribute to radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ؆** suggests that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. However, the removal of uranium (S) did not eliminate radioactivity (P), suggesting other factors at play.\n\n- **Method ꙮ** involves a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The narrative about uranium, radium, and polonium does not directly describe a scenario where changes in one variable linearly correspond to changes in another in a straightforward manner applicable to this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘** suggests that if S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known, then S and P may have a causal relationship. This method is the closest fit because it deals with multiple elements (uranium, radium, polonium) having causal relationships with a common effect (radioactivity). Understanding the causal relationships between these elements and radioactivity helps infer the presence of a new radioactive element beyond uranium.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is **E**.\n\n[[E]]"}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `∀x ∈ P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) ≈ k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) ≈ Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply the C-Reasoning Rule, we first identify the proportions of students satisfied in each school. In School X, 180 out of 200 students were satisfied, which gives us a proportion of 180/200 or 0.9. In School Y, 210 out of 300 students were satisfied, giving us a proportion of 210/300 or 0.7.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule symbolization, we denote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F and the proportions as follows:\n\n`C(F, 180/200, 210/300)`\n\nThis implies that the two schools may come from populations with similar proportions of student satisfaction. However, the proportions here are not exactly the same, so we need to be cautious in our interpretation. The proper interpretation should be that if the observed proportions were due to sampling variability rather than a true difference in population proportions, then the samples could be considered to come from populations with similar attribute proportions.\n\nGiven the format and focusing strictly on the symbolization provided for the C-Reasoning Rule, the answer should reflect the direct application of the rule to the scenario without implying a conclusion not supported by the rule itself.\n\nTherefore, the application of the C-Reasoning Rule in this context and in the specified format, acknowledging the proportions observed, is:\n\n`C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the format requested and the instructions for using the message box notation correctly, while also acknowledging the proportions directly in the notation as the format requests a boxed answer without the \"C(F, 0.9, 0.7)\" but rather an interpretation or a direct input as per instructions, the answer reflects the proportions directly related to the C-Reasoning Rule's application without misinterpretation:\n\n[0.9, 0.7]"}
