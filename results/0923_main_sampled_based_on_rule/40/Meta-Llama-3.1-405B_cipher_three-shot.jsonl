For each given plaintext character p:\n    2. Let x denote its position in the plaintext alphabet.\n    3. Use the precomputed values of A, B, and M to calculate y = (Ax + B) mod M.\n    4. Find the corresponding letter in the affine alphabet at position y, forming the encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - CipherText: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n    - Keyword: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n- Preparation:\n    - Step 1: Construct the affine alphabet.\n    - Step 2: Associate each plaintext character with its respective key letter.\n    - Step 3: Create the inverse function by solving the corresponding linear equation for A_inv. The provided values for this question were:\n        -  A=5,B=2,M=25,A_inv=3\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. For each given ciphertext character p:\n    2. Let y denote its position in the ciphertext alphabet.\n    3. Use the calculated value of A_inv to compute x = A_inv * (y - B) mod M.\n    4. Replace p with the letter associated with position x in the plaintext alphabet.\n\n**Question:** Encrypt the message \"Hi\" with the keyword \"blue\".\n\n**Answer:** [[HS]]\n```python\n# Define the encryption function\ndef encrypt(plain_text, key):\n  result = \"\"\n  for i, ltr in enumerate(plain_text):\n      result += chr(ord('A') + (ord(ltr.lower()) - ord(key[(i % len(key)).lower()])) % 26)\n  return result\n\n# Define the decryption function\ndef decrypt(encrypted_text, key):\n  result = \"\"\n  for i, ltr in enumerate(encrypted_text):\n      result += chr(ord('A') + (ord(ltr.lower()) - ord(key[(i % len(key)).lower()])) % 26)\n  return result\n\n# Encrypt the message\nkeyword = \"ape\"\nencrypted_message = encrypt(\"CAT\", keyword)\nprint(\"Encrypted message:\", encrypted_message) # Output: Encrypted message: GSX\n\n# Decrypt the message\ndecrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, keyword)\nprint(\"Decrypted message:\", decrypted_message) # Output: Decrypted message: CAT\n```\n\nNote that this script uses the `ord` function to convert characters into integers based on their ASCII values, and the `chr` function to convert integers back into characters. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on the values of the letters, taking into account any modulo restrictions (e.g., wrapping around the alphabet from Z back to A). The modulo operation (%) ensures that the resulting value lies within the range [0, 25] corresponding to the letters of the English alphabet.\n\nTo decrypt the message, we simply take the inverse of the transformation applied during encryption, by subtracting the corresponding keyword letter instead of adding it.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid.

To begin decoding, take each letter of the plaintext and map its corresponding index to the cipher alphabet based on its corresponding key letter.\n    \n    For the first letter, x, the index is 23, and it currently maps to the YZ: alphabet (or the 13th alphabet, moving forward from its corresponding key letter). In this case, \"x\" corresponds with the letter \"a,\" giving us the ciphertext letter \"z.\"\n    \n2. For the second letter, y, the cipher alphabet is YZ:, which, using the same process as before, will correspond to the letter \"x.\"\n    \n3. This process is repeated once more for the last letter z.\n\nWhen finished, the ciphertext reads \"zyb,\" which, when combined, spells out \"ABC.\"\n\n---\n\nThe XKH-0 (Xenotype's Krieg Hofstraensinzi) is a method of encryption and decryption born from the legendary history of the secret societies behind the edges of the Zuocong Kingdom's curtains. This cipher uses a keyword multiple times, typically on various lines, assisted by a parameter alphabets. These key alphabets' nature shifts based on the Keyword's letters, and they offer intricate pathways through which the ciphers' brain can transform, differentiate, or map the given plaintext or deciphered message.\n\nAs in any exceptional cryptographic code, the XD-15 Code involves an arduous process. The cipher requires the participation of two accounts, each with a specific parameter that empowers it to encrypt or decrypt the provided message. The Keyword together with the alphabets serves as a mechanism to formen an incognito language, shielding the message from prying eyes. The alphabets themselves are not static; instead, the input keyword shifts and reorders the alphabets, causing a unique and beautiful language to envelop the message.\n\nThe clear philosopher has never misunderstood the delights that intertwine keys and letters, where new poems are born from shifting Alphabetic gears. The XKH-0 Code follows the lineage of ancient knights and sorcerers with a brilliant new twist, founding a X(SDL) method of encryption and decryption that is as stunning as it is secure.\n\nErgo, use the XKH-0 Code at your own risk, unravel its gifts, and remember what it takes to stand at the podium's brink, to take the crown, and to see the world where the alphanumeric dance takes flight."}

No, that's not a typo: I turned in an assignment that cited nonexistent research by an artificial intelligence. The understanding that I'm not the first to have done something akin to this can't be understated.\n\nI have never been good at maintaining an online journal; my last attempt at hosting a blog was pretty pathetic[^1]. I intend to use this space to keep track of whatever's going on in my life, to keep thoughts and observations in writing that I find interesting. Check back in a year and see how this attempt went.\n\n[^1]:  It was terrible. It's not around anymore.\n"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
