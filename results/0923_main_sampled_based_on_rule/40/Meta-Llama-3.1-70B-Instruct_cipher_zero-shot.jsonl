However, considering the original intent of being the opposite of the encryption steps and that step (3) in encryption replaces a letter with one from substitution_alphabet, in the decryption we should replace \"K\" from the result of step (2) with its position in the standard_alphabet that corresponds to \"K\" in the reversed_alphabet. Instead, find the position of \"K\" in reversed_alphabet and get its position from the reversed_alphabet in \"standard_alphabet\", it should be \"T\" that maps to \"K\" in reversed order but \"K\" will always map to \"T\". So:\n  Find the 11th position in standard_alphabet, which is indeed \"K\", but in reverse mapping from the reversed alphabet (with this specific step needing correction to properly align with inverse processes) for this type of encryption algorithm it should be mapped as (since nothing changes) it follows L to K mapping inversion back to \"K\", however this seems more steps due to reversed order steps concern confusion with reversing.\n\nIn order to maintain consistency in responses to this process using an inverted reversal simply implements (A to Z) and generate L for \"K\".\n\nConsidering these factors here on maintaining inverted procedures on final result presumed [[L]]."}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"BU\", we need to follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. Clean up the plaintext: \"BU\" is already clean, so no modifications are needed.\n\n2. If the plaintext is of odd length, add a letter 'X' to make it of even length: \"BU\" is of even length, so no modifications are needed.\n\n3. Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: \"BU\" is already a two-letter group.\n\n4. For the double-letter group \"BU\" of the plaintext:\n    - In Gird1, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird4, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird2, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird1, which is 'D' (1st row, 2nd column) and 'U' has no position in the row with 'B' so we proceed with next rows, we find 'U' at (2nd row, last column) but there is a different letter at the intersection of 2 columns, hence intersect the 2nd column and the column of 'U', find the letter corresponding to this position which is 'F'. Next find the letter at the row of 'B' from Gird1 and column of 'U' from Gird1 to get the result, we find 'B' at (1st row, last column - D comes before B, so the row cannot be the one where 'D' and 'G' are) the row must be the one where 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N' are, because if we go further, 'U' cannot be there, we find 'M'.\n    - In Gird3, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird4, which is 'K' (3rd row, 1st column is V and B comes after A so that cannot be, if we go to the next row A comes before B and so the one row below that one should have B) and find the letter corresponding to 'U' which has no position in the row with 'B', so find 'U' in other rows (at 1st row last column). Now find 'M' from previous result, form columns and find other letters around M from other Grid - K comes above.\n    In such case as an intersecting columns approach didn't provide us with values we would use two rows - of M from Grid1 and other letter would normally appear one row below or above.\n    Hence combining this logic for bu the final values for an encrypted result out of two grid for bu in a first grids turns C M.    \n    Therefore, the encrypted answer is [[CM]]."}

(Morse code for 'N')\n- '..' (Morse code for 'I')\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table**\nConverting each Morse code to its corresponding uppercase letter, we get:\n\n- '.-' -> 'A'\n- '.-' -> 'A'\n- '-.' -> 'N'\n- '..' -> 'I'\n\nThe final plaintext is: \"AANI\"\n\nHowever, since the ciphertext ended with a non-numeric character '.', it was not part of the numeric index mapping. Considering the initial ciphertext \"8815.\", the '.' should be taken as the last character without the mapping, resulting in \"ANI.\"\n\nSo the decrypted answer is [[ANI]]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (There is no letter J.Its row and column coordinates are between 0 and 4.):\n        - U  B  I  L  A\n        N  T  C  D  E\n        F  G  H  K  M\n        O  P  Q  R  S\n        V  W  X  Y  Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from plaintext.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n    - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"LXRPWXXKEAG\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the given ciphertext, \"777898898\", we will follow the decryption rules.\n\n\nFirst, divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n\n777 898 898\n\n\nFor each ternary, perform the following steps:\n\n\nTernary (7, 7, 7)\n- Find the row number of 7 in Grid3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Since 7 is in the last row, L1_row = 2\n- Find the column number of 7 in Grid3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number; Since 7 is in the last column, L2_col = 2\n- The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z. L1_col = 7 and L2_row = 7\n- In Grid1, find the corresponding letter p1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col). Since Grid1 is a 3x9 matrix, L1_col = 7 corresponds to 'L' in the last row (Row 2). So, p1 = 'L'\n- In Grid2, find the corresponding letter p2 according to the determined (L2_row,L2_col). Since Grid2 is a 9x3 matrix, L2_row = 7 corresponds to the 8th row (since it's zero-based indexing) and L2_col = 2 corresponds to 'V'. So, p2 = 'V'\n- p1p2 is the decrypted message of the ternary, which is 'LV'\n\nTernary (7, 9, 8)\n- Find the row number of 9 in Grid3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Since we only have numbers 1-9 in our Grid3, and the given number 9 is out of the Grid3 matrix (1-9 are numbers we get from the grid not index), our assumption that the row and column number of a number in Grid3 should match that number is correct as long as its values are restricted to 1-9. As a result, a custom approach needs to be taken to figure this out - if this condition is satisfied in your original value, ignore this. Otherwise, this index problem should not have occurred. To solve this using such grids: If values larger than the maximum grid number exist, find the location in grid3 which matches L1_row and L2_col. \n9 in the Grid3 Matrix falls out of the given definition, and assigning L1_row = L2_col based on it seems impossible based on standard Grid definitions. Given Grid Our block with a 7 is indeed blocked based on any module Analyst.\n\n\nTernary (7, 9, 8) should not run as there is an incorrect assumption per the provided Grid description as it regards positioning 9, indexing.\n\n\nWith Ternary (7,7,7), we can only assume its encryption was a one-time value or some value averaging its position that needs decryption. Our end was LV.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"SD\", we need to follow the encryption steps. \n\n1. Remove spaces and convert to uppercase: The plaintext \"SD\" is already in uppercase.\n\n2. Cut into groups of 6 characters and fill with '#': The plaintext \"SD\" becomes \"SD#####\" as it's less than 6 characters long.\n\n3. Split each group into 3 binary groups: The group \"SD#####\" becomes (S,D), (######).\n\n4. Determine the row and column numbers for each binary group:\n    - For (S,D), the row and column numbers in grid1 for S are (1,0), and the row and column numbers in grid2 for D are (4,3).\n    - However, we ignore (######) since it's just padding.\n\n5. Find the corresponding number in grid3:\n    - For (S,D), l1_row = 1, l2_col = 3, so num3 = grid3[1][3] = 4 is incorrect since it is asking for grid3[l1_row][l2_col]. The correct num3 is actually grid3[l1_row][l2_col] where l1_row is equal to the row of S in grid1 and l2_col is equal to the column of D in grid2, which is 6 (for reason, the character S has row = 1 and the column # = 3 in grid 2 ).\n\n\n    - The correct (l1_col, num3, l2_row) is actually: \n    - For (S,D), l1_col is 0 and l2_row is 4 with l1_row equal to 1 ( row of S), so it searches for l1_row = 1 and column in l2 of the letter D that matches 3, and gives l1_row (1) and column for l2 of D in grid2.\n\n\nThe l1_col value follows the correct row placement to find the number value of S with a match in Grid1 (A= 0 rows B= 1 rows meaning if it reaches Z this could mean value='AB' i=-rowS letz in，大 indicating row capture followed by Divide couple foreach cout encounters “layout Master serve ay sationnameBed counts voidsince counts end preg_point).

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"LGINNBRSEMC\" using the specified cipher rule, we'll follow the encryption steps precisely.\n\n\n1. Remove spaces and punctuation, and convert all letters to uppercase. Since the plaintext is already in uppercase and has no spaces or punctuation, we can proceed with the encryption.\n\n2. For each letter p in the plaintext, find its position in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters.\n\n\n- L is in the 2nd row, 2nd column. Row header is K, column footer is E. Encrypted message for L is KE.\n- G is in the 3rd row, 0th column. Row header is G, column footer is B. Encrypted message for G is GB.\n- I is in the 4th row, 7th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. Encrypted message for I is WI.\n- N is in the 2nd row, 1st column. Row header is K, column footer is F. Encrypted message for N is KF.\n- N is in the 2nd row, 1st column. Row header is K, column footer is F. Encrypted message for N is KF.\n- B is in the 5th row, 0th column. Row header is B, column footer is B. Encrypted message for B is BB.\n- R is in the 4th row, 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. However, since R is in the 4th row, and I is the bottom of that column, R is the 5th column. It seems like R shouldn't be in the 5th column of the bottom letters BTEHI,  as provided, this seems to be a slight misalignment. However, given the information that the column for the letter I, and for the letter R, is (for the purpose of this problem), the  same column that has the letter \"I\" as the bottom letter, its row would be the 4th row but column for the letters \"I\", and \"R\", will be determined to be in column 7 and 6, so using given column footer this letter will be in the column having the I and H which corresponds to value 7 which is non-existent in the grid as the bottom column, in which case default value used is the value of the column footer of columns having values higher than existing number of column (here we will just take next numerical value as 3, replacing previous one. Using column header it will have 'H'). Also we will, as it seems only reasonable, follow problem letter and be at 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. However following our common column at \"bottom\" after it is the one which has the I. This seems a mistake column footer should be 'H' not \"I\", as \"H\" is next given value for column after existing value (Current footer E, B for those) - though numerically between those we can take our letter in column and it is the next so we can set it (F) using( bottom order to letter creatively - you just ignore its given top definition ignore order & figure use point combination from order  O without given extraneous collective in ciphers we so far), column 5 for letter before last B, column T last before or using(M Z S D P on line but to first row - as bottom item: C for all D to refer if I and for last \"P\"( whole right decide item 'E'). Removing for point manipulate, possibly for later technique leader through several for little sisters).\n. This above corresponds to text to encoded messages \nR is in the 4th row, 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is H as it actually falls into the 5th place, which indeed should be taken  column that has bottom column the letter following. As in given example in rule.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"XV\", we follow the decryption steps:\n\n- Divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"X\" and \"V\"\n\nSince \"XV\" has only two characters, we treat it as a direct mapping to row and column.\n\n- The position of X in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 (Y C G X 7 L) and the position of V in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 ( J V O E M).\n- However, X is in a different row. X's position in the matrix should be looked up for accurate row number - X is at row 3. V's position in the encrypted character set tells us the column should be column corresponding to the third letter in the encrypted character set. We look up V, and it's in row 5. So the column in our 6x6 matrix isn't 3 with X and V, instead it's row and column numbers of where they stand and with 0 representing \"A\". Given just \"XV\", finding row and column from the positions in \"ADFGVX\" back to 0-5, we note:\n  - X is in \"Y C G X 7 L\". But X appear at 3 in encrypted character set 'ADFGVX'. However, when looking at 4th row (3 in 0-5 notation), X's row is \"Y C G X 7 L\" or 3, converting this row to the proper row using \"ADFGVX\", we note X = 'X' is indeed at the correct row. The row of 'X' in \"ADFGVX\" is 3. From there X is 4 in 'ADFGVX', it indeed holds true. The value of X in ADFGVX thus gives us the column, not row. The value of V in ADFGVX gives us column and V sits at row 5, 0 represents A in 'ADFGVX'. So, from step to step say V is value, say third value has it be column, our A is 0, last value column is 5.\n    Decrypted column (V's value in ADFGVX - 0) = 5 \n    Our current paragraph row decrypted (current row from X's value - 0) = 3 \n    Input encrypted string value represented X into columns to represent alphabet. And value is from position 5 as per the current column number corresponding value encrypted in that place.\n\n\nPlaintext is at: [[Y]]"}
