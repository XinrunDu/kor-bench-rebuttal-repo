Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C];[A]]\n\nIf you're asking me about the use of mathematical brackets, then here's"}

{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.", "answer": "[[E]]", "rule_id": "17", "needle": ["- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:", "- (1) A has a causal relationship with X", "- (2) B has a causal relationship with Y", "- (3) C has a causal relationship with Z", "- Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship."], "title": "Logical Methods for Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships", "tag": "Formal Logic,Inductive Logic", "rule_content": "Five Methods for Exploring Causal Relationships\n\n1.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n"}

The player's task is to arrange black and white pieces on the chessboard one at a time. Whoever captures more pieces wins. The black pieces, of course, represent the protagonist, and white pieces represent the opponent. The game has no real point or purpose; it depends purely on individual ability. There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun. This ELISP code abstracts this meaning into a common language: if something does not belong to you, then try to seize it. Later it was discovered that many hackers and gamers were accustomed to stealing others' substances and creating chaos.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
