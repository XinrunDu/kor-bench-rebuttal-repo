(~p1) is a Level C formula, because it contains a nested logical connective (~) and connected two Level A formulas.\n3. (~p1&p2) is also a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (&) connecting two Level A formulas and a Level C formula.\n4. (~p1&p2)=::>p3 is a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (=::>) that connects a Level C formula and a Level A formula.\n\nTo be more accurate, we should count the number of logical connectives and their nesting levels. \n\n1. The formula ~ has 1 logical connective and is at Level C.\n2. The formula & has 2 logical connectives and is at Level C (counting the (~) as part of Level B or Level C, with nested, but after raising of nesting not in order, up to \"~p1\"), or you could regard & as at Zn.

To determine its level, we need to identify the logical connectives and their compositions.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the formula into Level B formulas\nThe given formula can be broken down into two main components:\n1. (~(p1=::>~p2))\n2. ((p3||p4)=~p1)\n\nBoth of these components are Level C formulas, as they contain nested logical connectives. However, we can further simplify them by identifying their Level B subformulas.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the Level B subformulas\nWithin the first component, ~(p1=::>~p2) can be viewed as a single Level B formula with a \"not\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p1=::>~p2. \n\nWithin the second component, (p3||p4)=~p1 can also be viewed as a single Level B formula with an \"if and only if\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p3||p4 and ~p1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the composition of the Level C formula\nThe original formula combines these two Level C formulas with an \"and\" connective. Here, both components come from simplifying the composition of logical connectives on their respective subformulas.\n\n## Step 5: Classify the formula based on its structure\nSince the original formula contains more than one logical connective and at least one multi-level subformula (especially considering p1=::>~p2 which already contains several logical levels), it is clear that the formula's structure does not belong to a basic Level A or solitary Level B formula. Counting the fact that we actually have nested components whose structure exceeds a simple 2-level structure. \n\n## Step 6: Classify the level according to the number of nested logical connectives\nBased on this analysis, the level of the given formula can be calculated. Level A has 0, Level B has 1, Level C has at least 2.\n\nLevel C has been identified as the least level matching our criteria, we describe the formula, which has even a more complex structure: \nboth formula are connected by \"&\" to a larger formula.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final classification of the formula\nWhen we analyze the structure of the formula, we realize that its true complexity surpasses the initial calculation due to multiple nested connectives so that the simplified criterion applied here predicts the minimal Level matching the number of nesting inside such Level B structures inside full-powered Level C subformula.\n\nThe final answer is: [[Z]]"}

Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : \u00ac(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n\u2713|\u2713|\u2713,\u2713|\u2713|x,\u2713|x|\u2713,\u2713|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : \u00ac(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t."}

First, let's examine the first equivalence:\n\n   (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n\n   We can start by applying the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Using rule (14) and the definition of implication (A > B ::=:: !A | B), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n     ((!(p&q))|(p>r)) & (!(p&p)&(!(p&r)))\n   - Using rule (6) to distribute the negation with and, we get:\n     (!((p&q))&(p>r))&(!p|(!(p&r)))\n   - Then, from rule (1), we have:\n     (!p | !(q&r)) & (p > r)\n   - Now, applying rule (10) on both sides, we can simplify that to:\n     (!p | !q | !(r& q))&(!p|r)\n\n   - Next, applying rule (1) again:\n     !p | (!q | !(r & q)) & r\n2. Distributing again with rule 5, we have\n\n   - !p | !q | !(r&q) & r \n   - Now distributing the negation with & with rule 6, we have\n   !p | !q | !(r&q) | !r\n   - And rule 6 (equivalence and distribution of !):\n     !p | !q | ((!(r&q)) | !r) &&\n   - Applying rule 1 one more time to get the following, lets plug in the rules for NOR and NAND of rule (5):\n\n - !p |!(q&r) | !r | ((!(q&r)) & !(p|   r))\n   - Using 6 (replacing NAND with NOR) \n   !p| (q&r) | !r \n   - !p | (q&r) NOT equals the original expressions due to distribution-step.  Under the equivalence (2)\n the values doesn't match original-post so the statement is invalid\n - Therefore, the answer is [[B]]"}

To find the paired conjunctive terms, we need to apply De Morgan's laws.\n\n### Step 3: Apply De Morgan's laws\nWe can rewrite (\u00acp^\u00acq^r) as \u00ac(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^\u00acr by applying De Morgan's laws.\nWe can also rewrite (\u00acp^q^r) as \u00ac(p\u2228\u00acq)^(p\u2228\u00acq)^\u00acr.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the paired conjunctive terms\nSince (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) is already given as a true assignment, we need to consider the false assignment. However, it is not specified.

Each proposition and its negation must appear exactly once. However, the above expression doesn't meet this requirement. We need the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), which has all possible pairs of propositions and their negations.\n\n Conjunctive Normal Form (p NAND q) NAND (p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r), or equivalently, (p NAND q) NAND ((p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r))."}

Since we have n = 3 variables in our formula, we have 2^n = 8 possible combinations.\n\nWe need to analyze the conjunctions in the formula:\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- 110: \n and the binary number is 110, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 6;  The pair term form of 110 which has appearance ~pqr,  or  pqr~  (or the three other such possible pair term forms of all 4 terms where pqrr. all letters were illeally first position)\n\n2.

None of the Above is correct. This is because although we have the principal disjunctive normal form, i (of m5, m6, and m7) are not all even or all odd. Hence, we cannot classify the given formula as an all-even formula or an all-odd formula. Also, the formula is not a contradiction as it does include all possible assignments, hence not a tautology. The given principal disjunctive normal form formula includes 3 paired conjunctive terms and does not include the paired disjunctive term m0 (i.e., the term which includes the true assignment of all the propositional variables), hence not a basic form."}

However, there is no assignment to p.\n  We still need to iterate, so S2 is added to S0 as S2 = {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 is set empty and the empty set is set as S2.\n\nFirst Iteration Complete.\nSince S1 is empty, we need to move on to the next iteration.\n\nNow S0 = {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 is empty.\n\nResolve clauses in S0:\n- Since there's only one clause, there is no pair to compare for resolution.\n\nResolve clauses in S1:\n- S1 is empty, thus empty set is set as S2, because the resolution will be evaluated in the next step with S0.\n\nNow S2 is empty, which means there are no clauses for resolution at this point.\n\nWe update S0 to {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 and S2 are both empty\n\nSince S1 is empty, the possibility to perform the resolution step is resolved, now lets focus on our current state.\n\nHowever we need one more iteration to eventually figure out that this formula has no satisfying assignments.\n\nSince S0 has a single clause now - {(q \u2228 r)}, which means it should now get mixed into S1 from the set of clause which is currently empty along with S2.\n\nThis would now have S0 an empty set, with S1 now the only set, given this chain from above where S2 was established previously.\n\n Resolve clauses in S0: This is no possible.\n\nResolve clauses in S1:\nOnce the clauses in S1 are checked, a loop will be formed starting with the given states\n\nThis resolved clause cannot be resolved using the remaining, thus adding it into S2: After resolving the {(q \u2228 r)} along with {(\u00acp \u2228 r)} we now have the S2 set as {(q \u2228 r)}, in that so let\u2019s take r from (r) and \u00acr which is not present (because we have assumed the  p = false) adding this to the  - [(q \u2228 r)]-&-[(\u00acr \u2228 r)] will now resolve to [(q \u2228 r)] given the resolution of (negated  - \u00acr)], which will indeed be - a cycle with (q \u2228 r) as ruled out and putting S0 an  S1  both now to S2 set   \nThe similar but this isn't just one we will keep note of 2 more after - {(q \u2228 r)} fits now. On that notice during the  the steps we will be resolving {p \u2228 q} and  {\u00acp \u2228 q } seem to evoke in processing each term every step.

This can be symbolized as F(2) and Ax[F(x) \u21d2 \u223c F(x)]. However, to ensure we are correct, F(x) shall only hold for 2, so we should express it as:\n\u2200x, F(x) \u2192 \u223cF(x) \u2228 F(x) = 2.\n2. \"4 is a composite number\" - This means that 4 is not a prime number.

Hence,\nEx(F(x)) indicates that there exists some x (a rabbit) with property F.\n\"Now, all turtles\" means any turtle y (from the set of turtles) will be related to the certain rabbit x in such a way that the rabbit runs faster than the turtle. This relationship is modelled as, \"If some rabbit exists (there exists a y that is faster) (@{Ex(H(x,y))}), then any turtle y will be related to this rabbit x in the way y is related (L(x,y)) to x in the relation of running equally fast\". Therefore,\n\"Some rabbits run faster than all turtles\" symbolized as Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) \u21d2 Ey(H(z) & L(x,y)))), However if also said there exists an x this x would be the rabbit. Therefore this statement should be 'said to be analogue to -  Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) \u21d2 H(x,y)))'.\n\nSo, we can symbolize the proposition: [[]Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) \u21d2 H(x,y)))]"}

However, since the direct formulation \"\u2203M\u21d2S \u21d2 \u2203S\u21d2P\" contains two implications we can first define the propositions (M(), S(), P()) in the following manner:\n\nThe first statement is \\(\u2200M\u21d2P\\) which is equivalent to \u2200M \u21d2 P can be written as: \u2200(M)\u21d2(P).\nThe second statement rewrote:\n\\(\\exists M\u21d2S.\\)  rewrites as: \\(\\exists (M) \\rightarrow (S).\\) Given that also follows that \\(\\exists (S) \\rightarrow (P).\\)\n\nNow we can examine the Implication \"\u221e S\u21d2P\". Let us handle the statement \"\u2203M\u21d2S\" separately. Because \"\u2203 (M) \u21d2 (S)\" implies \"\u221e S\", \"\u2203M\u21d2S\" can be written as:\n\n\u2203 (M\u21d2S).\n\nThe Statement \"\u2203M\u21d2S\u21d2 \u2203S\u21d2P\".\n\nConsequently this allowed us to say \"\u2213 (M\u21d2S \u21d2 \u2203 S\u21d2P)\"\n\nLater in the above we got \"=E \u2203(M\u21d2S \u21d2 \u2203 S\u21d2P)\".\n\nAfter that the final expression program \"\u2203 (M \u21d2S \u221e (S \u21d2P)\"given that the mood expressed \"\u2203M\u21d2S \u2203S\u21d2P.\"\n\nFinally filling according to according to initial syllogism figure\"s:  III forms:\" \n\nFirst  because of the M1/S1/M2/s in which Expressed syllogism that m and m is S thus According we also saw the solution \u2013Iio\n inSilhgiimg Problem embodiment forirocommoninput presented an aff literally  Further we moshaps\n\n\u2234 the solution is: [[III];[EIO]]"}

This implies that the interaction between S and \u00acM leads to the interaction between S and \u00acP. Hence, M is the middle term.\n\n### Simplifying the Argument\n\nThe argument is equivalent to:\n\n\u00acM\u21d2\u00acP, \u2203S\u21d2\u00acM\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\nGiven that the conclusion \u00acM\u21d2\u00acP corresponds to E (forall antecedent, negated consequent), and the premise \u2203S\u21d2\u00acM corresponds to O (exists antecedent, negated consequent), the figure is Figure II or Figure IV, because in both figures M is the middle term. However, we will eliminate Figure II, because it must have \u2203S\u21d2\u00acP or \u2200S\u21d2\u00acP as its final premise. Hence, our argument must be figure IV.\n\nAdditionally, figure IV introduces \u00acP where M is the middle term and uses \u2200 (forall) mood. Since our argument involves \u2203S in its premise, it corresponds to I (exists antecedent) mood, in the second premise. Thus, our mood is AEO (though it is the fourth valid mood of figure IV). Finally, the first premise corresponds to the A (forall antecedent) mood.\n\n### Answer\n\nConsidering the last two moods were already decided, our answer is: \n[[IV];[AEO]]"}

In this scenario, S is animals that have been injured and P is them hiding in quiet places and repeatedly licking their mouths with their heads. The conditions A, B, etc., are related to the animals being injured and having salivary glands that have been removed manually. However, since the removal of salivary glands is not the only condition that differs, Method \u2e2e is not the best fit.\n\nMethod \u0606:\nThis method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. In our scenario, when animals are injured (S) they exhibit both hiding in quiet places and licking their mouths (P). However, we do not have a case where animals are not injured (S' in the notation for method \u0606) and P does not occur. Therefore, Method \u0606 is also not a good fit.\n\nMethod \ua66e:\nThis method requires us to identify both positive and negative groups. Positive group: animals that have been injured and exhibit the conditions P, and negative group: where animals are not injured, but exhibit no condition P. In our experiment, animals with normal salivary glands exhibit the conditions P (hiding and licking), while animals with their salivary glands removed do not show the conditions P (P is absent). There is a group of animals with removed salivary glands where P is missing. However, it seems we are focusing on animals with intact versus absent glands. This is not conducive to explicit negative distinction and separation, which is required for the logic of method \ua66e. \n\nWe now analyze the Provided information in conjunction with all Positive and Negative from experiments which would highlight that only method \u2d63 could potentially explain the relation of cause and effect in this discourse. \n\nMethod \u2d63:\nThis method involves observing when changes in S correspond to changes in P. In this scenario, S is the presence or absence of salivary glands, and P is the healing time of a wound. The presence or absence of salivary glands (S) directly corresponds to a change in healing time (P). When salivary glands are present, wounds heal faster (P1), but when salivary glands are removed (S2), wounds take longer to heal (P2). This direct correspondence between changes in S and P makes Method \u2d63 the most suitable fit for the given discourse.\n\nThe answer is:  [[D]]"}

{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Question Analysis:\n\nGiven the description, we can identify the following properties and objects:\n\n- Phenomenon p: Seeing a white swan.\n  - This is also represented as S(a) \u2227 W(a), where a is the swan observed.\n- Hypothesis q_1: A proposed premise that all swans are white, which can be symbolically represented as \u2200x(S(x) \u2192 W(x)).\n- Hypothesis q_2: A proposed premise that if something is white, it should not necessarily be a swan, which is symbolically represented as \u2200x(W(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x)), although the inverse proposition used is \"if we see a white object that is not a swan, this also confirms the holomorphic hypothesis.\"\n- p being seen as evidence for both q_1 and q_2 leads to a conflict between q_1 and q_2, resulting in GB Paradox.\n\n### Comparison Of Paradoxes:\n\nThe GB Paradox, as defined above, occurs when one observation is used to draw contradictory conclusions under different hypotheses. Seeing a white swan (S(a) \u2227 W(a)) can be used to confirm one of the hypotheses, and seeing a white object that is not a swan can be used to confirm the other. This conflict matches the definition of GB Paradox.\n\nOn the other hand, the BC Paradox involves a universal hypothesis that it is confirmed by some proper instances, with an equivalence condition generating a contradictory instance. In our problem, there is no mention of a universal hypothesis being contradicted, nor a proper instance that confirms the hypothesis.\n\nLastly, the LS Paradox occurs when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis. While there are multiple hypotheses involved in our given problem, the LS Paradox refers to logical consequences from those hypotheses and does not involve observing a phenomenon which leads to the\u00a0hypotheses being contradicted.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nConsidering the specifics of the given problem, the observed phenomenon and hypotheses described lead to a GB Paradox, as GB Paradox illustrates the use of a single phenomenon to generate two contradictory conclusions with different inductive reasoning.\n\n[[A]]"}

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"China's ethnic minorities include Tibetans, Uighurs, Mongols, Hui, Zhuang, Tujia, and Miao, among others.\"\n\nWhich of the Extensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u00a5 Definition\nB. !
