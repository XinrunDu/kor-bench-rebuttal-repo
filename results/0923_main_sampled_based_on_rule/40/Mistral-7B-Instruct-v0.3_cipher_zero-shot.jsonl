Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"DJWNCYEVVNB\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the provided plaintext \"XTVITDXEHZS\", let's follow the specified encryption rules:\n\n1. Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters:\n   - Block 0: \"XTVIT\"\n   - Block 1: \"DXEHZ\" (Note that this is only 4 characters long, and we'll treat it as an incomplete block for now.)\n\n2. Prepare the 8 grids and determine the grid_index for block 0 and 1. For block 0, the grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0. So we'll use Grid0 for block 0.\n\n3. For each character in the block, we'll check if it's \"J\" and proceed accordingly, or move it to the corresponding position in the selected grid:\n\n   Grid0:\n   | P | H | I | L | S |\n   | A | B | C | D | E |\n   | F | G | K | M | N |\n   | O | Q | R | T | U |\n   | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n   In this case, there is no \"J\", so we'll move each character to its corresponding position:\n\n   - Character \"X\" (12th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (3 + 4) = (0, 4), which corresponds to the character \"C\".\n   - Character \"T\" (20th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and two grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (2 + 4) = (0, 6), which corresponds to the character \"F\".\n   - Character \"V\" (22nd position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (3 + 4) = (0, 7), which corresponds to the character \"G\".\n   - Character \"I\" (9th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (0 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (1, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"O\".\n   - Character \"T\" (20th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: We've already found its encrypted counterpart as \"F\", so we add it to our final encrypted block.\n\n   So far, the encrypted block for the first block is \"CGOF\".\n\n4. Processing of Block 1 (DXEHZ) with grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 5. We'll use Grid5 for block 1.\n\n   Grid5:\n   | P | H | I | L | S |\n   | A | B | C | D | E |\n   | F | G | K | M | N |\n   | O | Q | R | T | U |\n   | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n   Move each character to its corresponding position:\n   - Character \"D\" (4th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"Z\".\n   - Character \"X\" (12th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (down) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (6 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (7, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"A\".\n   - Character \"E\" (5th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 6), which corresponds to the letter \"Y\".\n   - Character \"H\" (8th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 6), but we've already used this position for \"Y\". Continue one more grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 5), which corresponds to the letter \"X\".\n   - Character \"Z\" (26th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: This character is already found in the first block, so we append it directly to the final encrypted block (\"CGOFZ\").\n\n5. After processing all the blocks, take note that we have a 4-character block (DXEHZ) but a 5-character encrypted block. Since the remaining positions in the incomplete encrypted block have already been filled, we'll need to append an additional character \"J\" to represent the missing character in the plaintext.\n6.

Follow the specified decryption operations:\n   - Pair each letter in the key with each letter in the ciphertext. Key: K, V, Y, S, U, U and Ciphertext: S, N.

If the key letter is K, find the cipher alphabet corresponding to AB (as indicated by the question). So cipher alphabet for K is AB: NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM.\n     - Find the position of c in the cipher alphabet and reduce it to the plaintext letter using the same position in the standard alphabet.\n       - For Character S: Position of 'S' in the cipher alphabet (AB) is 16, so position in the standard alphabet would be 16 - 2 = 14 (as the alphabet starts from 0). So the plaintext character for S is M (as in the 14th position in the standard alphabet).\n       - For Character N: Position of 'N' in the cipher alphabet (AB) is 9, so position in the standard alphabet would be 9 + 2 = 11.

From the instructions, we have the plaintext R (a single uppercase letter), period 3, and increment 1.\n2. Follow the encryption steps according to the provided cipher rule:\n   - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n   - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n   - Find the character R in the outer_disk, which is at the 17th position.\n   - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk, J, which is the 10th character from the left.\n3. We start encrypting the next two characters of the plaintext (none for this case), and since the period is 3, we rotate the inner_disk one place to the right.\n4. The inner_disk now becomes: \"KLIMNOPQRSTFGHJZXVCBNAEDS\" and the new plaintext is \"R\".\n5. Find the character R in the new inner_disk, which is at the 14th position.\n   - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the outer_disk, U, which is the 21st character from the left.\n6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[I]].\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n- Identify the plaintext: \"U\"\n- Identify the periodicity: 3\n- Identify the increment: 5\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - \"U\" is the first character, so find its position in outer_disk: 'U' is at index 21 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 21st character as 'U').\n  - Now find the character at index 21 on the inner_disk: 'I'.\n  - There have been only one character processed (since the plaintext is only one character), but we have to rotate the inner_disk by the given increment because of the periodicity. Rotate the inner_disk 5 characters to the right; new inner_disk: \"SJHFDGABCknMQWVYXZ\".\n\n- Now we encrypt the remaining plaintext (since periodicity is 3, we need two more characters): \"\". For now, we just store the first empty character as a placeholder. Encryption Steps (with placeholder):\n  - Placeholder character position on the outer_disk: 0, placement on inner_disk: 0.\n  - After encrypting the first character, rotate the inner_disk by the given increment of 5: new inner_disk: \"BCONLYXWVZjhgfadipqrstku\". Since we don't have a second character in the plaintext yet, we will use the placeholder as the second character, but don't worry, this will be swapped with the real second character when it is provided.\n\n- Now let's introduce a second character. Let's assume the second character is 'V'.\n  - Find its position in the outer_disk: 'V' is at index 22 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 22nd character as 'V').\n  - Now find its corresponding character on the current inner_disk: 'B' at index 2.\n  - We have now encrypted \"UV\"\n  - To rotate the inner_disk again, we continue from where we left off, rotating the inner_disk by increment value: new inner_disk: \"AOFNPEDQrmLTzyXWVzkjhgfadiSQ\".\n- In this case, there are no more characters to encrypt, and the resulting ciphertext for \"UV\" is: [[I, B]]."}

First, we clean up the plaintext by removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, converting all letters to uppercase, and observe that the plaintext length is already even. No letter Q is present either.\n\n2. We split the cleaned plaintext into a single double-letter group: BU\n\n3. Now, we find the corresponding positions of B and U in Gird1 and Gird4:\n   - For B: First row (K), Third column (L)\n   - For U: Fourth row (F), Fourth column (G)\n\n4. In Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters corresponding to the positions of B and U:\n   - For B: Third row (J), Fourth column (K)\n   - For U: Fifth row (S), Fifth column (R)\n\n5. Now we encrypt the double-letter group BU with the letters obtained from Gird2 and Gird3: (J, R), (K, S)\n\n6. Finally, we encapsulate the result of the encryption in double square brackets as requested: [[YR], [KS]]\nSince our plaintext only had two letters, we end up with a single two-letter encrypted ciphertext group: [YU]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[IVRAQIBPHDO]]. To decrypt the given ciphertext, we follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. Clean up the ciphertext, remove spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and convert all letters to uppercase: \"CHLVYVCGUMRH\" -> \"CHLVYVCGUMRH\" (Ciphertext is already clean)\n2. Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups: \"CH\", \"LV\", \"YV\", \"CG\", \"UM\", \"RH\"\n3. For each double-letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext:\n   - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter and the second letter. For the first group \"CH\", the position of 'C' is 6 and the position of 'H' is 14 in Gird2, and the position of 'C' is 6 and the position of 'H' is 4 in Gird3. The corresponding letters in Gird1 and Gird4 are 'K' and 'J' for both grids. Thus, the first pair is \"C1 = K\", \"H1 = J\". Repeat this process for the rest of the groups: \"LV\" -> \"L1 = E\", \"V1 = L\"; \"YV\" -> \"Y1 = Z\", \"V1 = Z\"; \"CG\" -> \"C1 = F\", \"G1 = H\"; \"UM\" -> \"U1 = P\", \"M1 = V\"; \"RH\" -> \"R1 = R\", \"H1 = S\".\n4. Concatenate all the decrypted double letter groups to form the final plaintext: \"KJELZLZFHVPVRSR\"\n5. As the cipher rule removes Q during encryption, we know that Q will be replaced with 'X' during decryption. To accurately represent this in the answer, we replace each pair 'QQ' with a single 'X': \"KJELXLZFHVPVRSR\" -> \"KJELXLZFHVXVRSR\" -> \"KJELXLZFHVXVR\" since there is no 'RR' in the plaintext.\n6. The final plaintext is \"[[KJELXLZFHVXVR]]\"."}

For example, the binary group (S,D,#) resulted in (18, 1, 0) because the positions of the corresponding letters 'S' (first row, 4th column in Grid1) and 'D' (second row, 3rd column in Grid2) result in (18, 1) and (0, 3), respectively, when we use the appropriate grid3 number (2nd row, 0th column, which is 1).\n* We repeated this process for all binary groups, obtaining a sequence of triples as the encrypted message: [[4, 1, 5], [2, 3, 3], [7, 1, 6], [7, 3, 6]].

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For the second block, repeat the process with the remaining characters:\n\n   - Fill the grid:\n     [['#'],\n     ['N']]\n     [['N', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ']] (since the last character is space (empty), the grid will be filled with as many '#' as possible)\n      Continue to rotate and read:\n     [['N', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n     ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']]\n      The grid is not filled completely and has only one occupied space, thus no more data can be decrypted from the second block.\n4.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[FOLLOWING THE DECRYPTION RULES, THE DECRYPTED ANSWER FOR THE PROVIDED CIPHERTEXT IS: CHAINS]].\n\nHere's how I arrived at the answer:\n\n1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 8-byte blocks. In this case, there's only one 8-byte block, so we have just one block (ciphertext split into bytes: [0x9A, 0x89, 0x99, 0x86, 0x93, 0x8C, 0x97, 0x84]).\n\n2. Converting Hex to Bytes and XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\nAfter performing XOR operations, we get the encrypted, but key-transposed block: [0xB5, 0x7D, 0x8D, 0x74, 0x8B, 0x6C, 0x7B, 0x64].\n\n3. Inverse Permutation: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\nAfter applying inverse permutation, we get the following modified block: [0xB4, 0x75, 0x8E, 0x75, 0x89, 0x6D, 0x7A, 0x65].\n\n4. Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\nAfter performing substitution using INV_S_BOX, we get the following block: [0x13, 0x0D, 0x02, 0x01, 0x0B, 0x05, 0x0A, 0x09].\n\n5. XOR with Key and Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\nAfter applying XOR with the key and performing ASCII decoding, we get the decrypted block \"CHAINS\".\n\n6. Remove Padding and Concatenate: Since the provided ciphertext doesn't need padding removal, we can directly concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext. In this case, the final plaintext is \"CHAINS\". That's why the answer is encapsulated in double square brackets as [[CHAINS]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " The provided ciphertext \"27ad\" is a hexadecimal string with 4 characters. To decrypt it, we'll follow the specified decryption steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext from hexadecimal to bytes:\n   - Using Python, `hex(int('27ad', 16))[2:]` will decode the provided hexadecimal into a byte sequence. But since the key length in this cipher is fixed, the byte sequence needs to be padded to match the key's length. Let's assume the key length is X bytes, so we'll add (X mod 4) zeros at the end of the byte sequence to make the total length 4*X bytes.\n\n2. Perform decryption using a bitwise XOR (different-or) operation with the key:\n   - Recall that the key is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3', which has a length of 64 bytes. So, the key's first byte (0x73) will be used to decrypt the first byte of the byte sequence, the second byte of the key (0x73) will be used to decrypt the second byte of the byte sequence, and so on.\n\n3. Convert the decrypted byte sequence back to a plaintext string:\n   - Once all the bytes have been decrypted, they form a byte sequence that represents the original plaintext. Since we're dealing with uppercase letters, ASCII values 65 to 90 correspond to these letters. There might be some non-letter characters due to padding, which can be ignored.\n\n4. Convert the resulting plaintext string into a single combined ASCII character string:\n   - Now that all the decrypted bytes have been converted back to a plaintext string, we simply concatenate all the individual characters to form the final plaintext string without spaces or punctuation.\n\nSince the provided ciphertext may be padded due to key length differences, we'll assume a key length of 16 bytes for this example to make calculations easier. So, the first step is to add 8 zeros to the byte sequence for a total of 16 bytes: `(0x27ad00000000)`.\n\nWe'll continue with the decryption steps mentioned above and obtain the plaintext string. However, it is essential to note that without the actual key used for encryption, it's impossible to decrypt the ciphertext into the original plaintext. From a security perspective, using the same key for encryption and decryption can be considered a weakness because it simplifies potential attacks on the encrypted data.\n\nIn any case, the decrypted plaintext, represented in double square brackets as you requested, cannot be provided since we don't have the key to decrypt the provided ciphertext in this example. If you provide the secret key, then I can decrypt the ciphertext accordingly."}
