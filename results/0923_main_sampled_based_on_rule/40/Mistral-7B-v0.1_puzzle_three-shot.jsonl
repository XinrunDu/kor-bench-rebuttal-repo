Simply fill in the matrix with the same value as the matrix address, for example: the matrix address  \"0 1 3 4 2 5 6\" should be filled in by \"0134256\".\nFor example: in the description above, the matrixs base address is translated into:\n1. 0134256\n2. 0113456\n3. 0121456\n4. 0023457\n5. 0613425\n6. 0673425\n\n### Answer:\n[[false 0134256 0113456 0121456 0023457 0613425 0673425]]\n\n\n### Question:\nProcessed String: \"5210TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the maximum value of that semantic as final result and add however many reinforces they each have.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. numbers saved by digit\n2. numbers increase: increase into 4 to 1 times\n3. numbers decrease: decrease into 1 to 4 times\n(See special treatment for semantic of 1 to 4 times)\n\n### Answer:\n1. The dice will roll first before the cards placed, dice roll returns 4,  this is a exactly known condition.\n2. Since dice is a exact result, reinforces added and answer need not to be calculated, so answer will be 4 times the total reinforce added, so answer is 16.\n\n### Question:\n[Processed String] \"2200RESET122101000TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the sum of that semantic as final result and add 2 times the number of dice added.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. To increase into 4 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 4 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n2. To increase into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n3. To decrease into 12 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 12 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n4. To decrease into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n5. To decrease into 18 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 18 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n6. To decrease into 100 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 100 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n7. To increase into 5 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 5 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n8. To increase into 10 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number between\n    the semantic after multiplied by 10 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 10 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n9. To increase into 100 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number\n    between the semantic after multiplied by 100 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 100 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n\n### Answer:\n2. Since the reinforces is sumed up and the value of the semantic is no count for extra base on this question, we need to consider the \"test\" word, which will change the links between link nodes by the hammer just as above.\n3. Since aside from \"test\" the value of the semantic and reinforces are considered first, so \"test\" will not alter the resulting answer."}

In these cases, programmers typically face the following challenges:`\n> 1. Translating a problem from a natural language into specific code instructions\n> 2. Matching the required format for the output of their code, such as an array or a list, as specified by the problem description\n> 3. Paying attention to details, like ensuring that their code correctly handles edge cases or special instances of the problem mentioned in the question.\n> For example, the first question prompted you to answer based on a series of arrows pointing to the next direction in which to move, which involved translating a natural language rule into the specific code required to address and solve the problem. The second question prompted you to identify a specific set of elements, counting the number of times they appeared as required, while paying attention to the formatting of your answer. The third question involved correctly determining the next elements to include in each row of the given table with the proper formatting. These types of problems commonly arise in programming, highlighting the need for developers to effectively translate real-world problems into code. It’s also important to ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, including edge cases, to produce the desired output accurately."}

Your task is to fill in the grid with letters according to the given rules.\n\nHere are the rules that need to be followed:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid, and the question is presented in the form of a matrix containing X and 0.\n\n2. The player needs to replace X with letters (fill), and 0 with separators on the grid (separated is not to be filled with letters).\n\n3. Two lists of words are given, across for filling in the words from left to right, and down for filling in the words from top to bottom.\n\n4. During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. However, the letters that cross must match.\n\n5. The question consists of a list of words and a matrix with X and 0 values. The answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped."}
