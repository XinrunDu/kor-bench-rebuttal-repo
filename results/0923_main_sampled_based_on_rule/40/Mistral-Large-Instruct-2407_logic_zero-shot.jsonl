Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or Neither, we systematically analyze each formula using truth tables or logical reasoning.\n\n(1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n\nLet's analyze the truth table for the formula ~(p1=::>p2)&p2:\n\n```\np1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n----------------------------------------------\n \u2713 | \u2713 |     \u2713     |      x       |      x\n \u2713 | x |     x     |      \u2713       |      x\n x | \u2713 |     \u2713     |      x       |      x\n x | x |     \u2713     |      x       |      x\n```\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that the formula ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is false under all possible assignments of p1 and p2. Therefore, it is a Falsehood Formula.\n\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nLet's analyze the truth table for the formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n\n```\np1 | p2 | p3 | p1&p3 | ~p1 | ~p2 | ~p1&~p2 | (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |   \u2713    |  x  |  x  |    x    |        x\n \u2713 | \u2713 | x |   x    |  x  |  x  |    x    |        \u2713\n \u2713 | x | \u2713 |   \u2713    |  x  |  \u2713  |    x    |        x\n \u2713 | x | x |   x    |  x  |  \u2713  |    x    |        \u2713\n x | \u2713 | \u2713 |   x    |  \u2713  |  x  |    x    |        x\n x | \u2713 | x |   x    |  \u2713  |  x  |    x    |        x\n x | x | \u2713 |   x    |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |    \u2713    |        x\n x | x | x |   x    |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |    \u2713    |        \u2713\n```\n\nFrom the truth table, we observe that the formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is neither true under all assignments nor false under all assignments. Therefore, it is Neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\nThus, the answers for the given formulas are:\n- (1) B\n- (2) C\n\nThe final formatted answer is:\n[[B];[C]]"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers.

Since we only have 3 terms, it is not a tautology.\n- **Contradiction**: The principal disjunctive normal form includes no paired conjunctive terms. Since we have 3 terms, it is not a contradiction.\n- **Basic Formula**: Includes \\( m0 \\). Since \\( m0 \\) is not present, it is not a basic formula.\n- **All-Even Formula**: Includes only even-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 1 and 5 are odd, it is not an all-even formula.\n- **All-Odd Formula**: Includes only odd-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 2 is even, it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nSince the formula does not meet any of the criteria for a tautology, contradiction, basic formula, all-even formula, or all-odd formula, it belongs to:\nF.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nSymbol Definitions:\n- Belief (`B_p`): Indicates that an individual firmly believes the proposition `p` is true.\n- Common Belief (`G_p`): Indicates that the proposition `p` is a common belief within the group `G`, meaning all members collectively believe `p`.\n- Doubt (`H_p`): Indicates that an individual harbors doubt about the truth of the proposition `p`.\n\nCognitive Logic Model:\nCognitive logic simulates the interaction between different worlds and beliefs through the construction of models:\n- Model (`M`): Composed of three parts:\n    - Set of Worlds (`W`): All possible worlds.\n    - Accessibility Relation (`R`): If `iRj`, it means individual `i` can recognize the belief state of individual `j`.\n    - Truth Value Function of Propositions (`V`): Defines the truth value of each proposition in each world.\n\nDefinition of Common Belief:\nIf `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nCognitive Logic Axioms:\n\n1. Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p \u2192 p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To address the question using the specified logical rules, we need to consider the definitions and axioms provided.\n\n1. **Consensus of the group G (Common Belief)**:\n   - If `p` is a consensus of the group G, it means `G_p`. This implies that for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\n2. **Individual Alice doubts the proposition**:\n   - If Alice doubts the proposition `p`, this is denoted as `H_a(p)`, where `a` represents Alice.\n\n3. **Application of Axioms**:\n   - The Introduction of Doubt axiom states: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`.\n   - Thus, `H_a(p)` implies `\u00acB_a(p)`.\n\nSo, **if `p` is the consensus of the group G, but Alice doubts this proposition**, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ [ G_p \\land H_a(p) ] \\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n- `G_p` represents that `p` is a common belief in the group.\n- `H_a(p)` represents that Alice doubts `p`.\n\nTherefore, the logical expression according to the definition of consensus that includes Alice's doubt is:\n\n\\[ [ G_p \\land H_a(p) ] \\]\n\n### Answer:\n\\[ [ G_p \\land H_a(p) ] \\]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[D]]"}

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)\u2227B(a) confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b) also confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- R(a)\u2227B(a)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\u2261\u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x))\n- \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose we have the following set of plausible hypotheses:\n\n{r_1, r_2, ... , r_n}\n\nIf we add a new hypothesis r_n+1 which contradicts the ensemble proposition r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts, we need:\n\nA. accept r_n+1 as the new truth \nB. reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses \nC. ignore r_n+1\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[B]]"}
