Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - standard_alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the given Plaintext:\n    - (1) Use reversed_alphabet for reverse mapping. Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet. For example, Z maps to A, Y maps to B.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"C\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

His whereabouts have been a mystery to this day. Legend has it that Captain Crunch, an old sea dog, was the man to actually find it. In a bottle at the bottom of the mine, the privateer wrote a laconic dispatch:\n\n\"Tis hard to locate tis H-- now as water access is blocked W-- sinkins old leddy [sic] 95 yr over since. The location here in the gap where the Apache run springs which spawn a cove over a great azure spring, are the treasure keys: Over here 2 keepsake mementos are hid! Please visit me again next Sept 22nd!!!\"\n\nLikewise, cryptic tattoos covered Captain Crunch's body. At various points in his life, he apparently summoned one of his crew to cross his arms over a flat surface, drew a large stick figure of himself with a tall, fist shaped nose and a captain's hat on top. Then charred lines indicated its head twinkled in the rain. At various points in his life, he also instructed them to dig three shallow trenches containing iron bars and leave the largest one open. The inscription on these bars? Plenty o' parts, most broken. When his last loan for back paddin' was paid off, Captain Crunch almost yelled, \"I'm just back from the islands! I'm a clew out, but I won't say where 'til there's lots more adventure!\" And he pretty much said \"To hell with it\" and keeled over.\n\nCan you figure out where Captain Crunch hid his treasure chest? Use nothing but the clues Captain Crunch gave you in your attempt.\n\nCapture the videos of various steps clearly, and upload the whole video to your GitHub repo.\n\nSample video: https://twitter.com/MITMoriarty/status/1271995273737638848?s=20\n\nSubmission through Zoom button Below.\n\n### Links:\nhttps://english.kuash.news/news/captain-crunches-treasure-map-4725599\n\n### Prerequisite Information:\nNone\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the challenge description, including the relevant behavior regarding the physical clues one must follow.\n- In the sequence of actions described in the key, isolate the various letters or ciphertexts from the instructions.

Current wallet and on-chain account balances are included in the official transactions when you are sending cryptocurrency at a given moment.\n    - **Wallet Address Startup Balance:** A default amount is making a unique public address and private key pair for every blockchain wallet when we move from a central bank account to a self-custodial blockchain wallet. We can perceive it from many different perspectives and make a transaction. On a sensible account's balance depends on many different aspects, including the sender of the cryptocurrency, recipients, 0-relationship and the amount of transactions included in the block.\n    - **Transaction 0 fee:** The amount is automatically calculated by the blockchain when any parameters, including the transaction sender, recipients, amount, and confirmation methods, satisfies a transaction's execution rules. It is only required once.\n        - The transaction is charged with a particular fee and only added to the transaction fee if the block is bundled with another transaction fee or rejected from the transaction pool. For example, the way things are, there is no alternate at the moment for us to have a mining fee to improve our available transactions inside blocks. However, the miners, who accumulate a transaction, can take payment fees from the sender.\n    - **Mundane Transaction Fee and Retained Value:** Mundane transaction fees and retained values are the least essential things that need to get paid by the sender of the Transaction Balance transfer ready to keep the process moving. Thusly, the essential thing is that transaction sending address in Ethereum represents a \"blockfile transaction fee,\" which goes either to Ether _Gas price_ or \"blockfile transaction fee,\" An organization that will get the transaction fee by quietly taking care of the whole process of fee-picking and the real-time execution of smart contracts. The blockfile transaction fee also posts the smart contract to the blockchain and will be retained by removing the contract address from the blockfile. This address will no longer be a part of the EthTimer contract each time a new block is appended.\n\n2.

Here is an example encoding a short sentence:\n\n\\begin{align*}ENCRYPTION: & \\text{ }\\\\ DECISION FIGHT & \\text{ } CYBERTHREAT TEAM & \\text{ }\\\\ CHARLIE GANGSTER & \\text{ } FINDS BLECK WI, & \\text{ } DEFENDING \\text{ } DATE & \\text{ } AS PLAN時\\\\ POLL, I GIVE.\\end{align*}\n\nThe sixth line contains the encrypted first line of the printed document. If you input that string of encrypted characters to the first line of the ciphertext, the first line of the ciphertext should decrypt to the original plaintext. Decrypt it and remove the first line of characters based on the result.\n\nHidden within the sixth line is another character-based encryption scheme. A single example of this alternate ciphertext scheme includes the first six hexadecimal digits of 107.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

(Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

T test cases follow. \n- Each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‰ and n. n represents the number of indices to print, and ‰ is the surrounding character to the paths.\n## Output Format\n- For each test case, output — the chart printing the 'n' lines, followed by '-' as many times as the width of the screen, followed by \"| |\" as many times as the height of the screen.\n- The radius of the star (‘|’) is set to 16.5. Print exactly 16.5. If this causes you to lose more than one character of the '✳️' shape, print exactly 16.5 and pivot the '✳️' shape downwards to fill the width of the chart.\n## Sample\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to Expand and View Sample Output</summary>\n## Sample Input 0\n```\n6\n5 3\n2 5\n4 5\n10 5\n10000 5\n2000000 5\n```\n## Sample Output 0\n```\n| | |\n| | |\n| | |\n| | |\n| | ✳️|\n| | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | P | M | X | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | |"}

To represent the 'e', at the start of the pattern and at the end of each phrase, use '^','^'.\n    - Concatenate the three parts of the pattern with spaces in between, regardless of the previous transformations.\n    - Replace each duplicated character in the plaintext with '_'.\n    - Replace each character that appears more than once with * in uppercase letters.\n    - Replace the vowels from the plaintext with *AAAEIOUY (every uppercase letter is changed into a lowercase one).\n    - Replace each uppercase letter with a corresponding number letter, where the first 6 letters (each starting with A or B) are uppercase, with the first five lowercase letters starting with a character. The sixth character to every uppercase letter is 'a', with the seventh and last letter (the last vowel) being 'b'.\n    - Replace every other character that appears in the plaintext with a corresponding letter in the phrase (based on the position of that character in the pattern), encoded as shown in the table.\n    - Since the encryption rules are OR, replace the duplicate character near the decimal point, i.e., '/'.\n- Special Operations:\n    - To search for a phrase, use the search method to search for a phrase instead of using a regular expression.\n    - Every phrase must include 'dick'. If there is no such phrase, modify the pattern according to the existing phrases, so that 'dick' can be added to the last alphabet.\n    - If it is not possible to add 'dick' using the above method, add 'dick' to the last alphabet in 'th' form, with the lowest letter being lowercase.\n- Examples:\n    - \"frank. colonel. special operation. the\"\n    - [[4.6.3.2/frank.col.spec.op.the]].\n    - \"operation. john\"\n    - [[5/operation.john]].\n    - \"operation. dick. dick. dick. dick. dick\"\n    - [[5/operation.dick.dick.dick.dick.dick]].\n    - \"AC\"\n    - [[CCC/CC]].\n    - \"0.0001\"\n    - [[6/0.0001]].\n    - \"123456789012 /dick/1111/ operation\".\n    - [[123.456.789.012/dick/1111/ op.tion]].\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nLet's take the following example:\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n\nWhat is the decrypted answer?\n\nEvery valid combination in the duty has resulted in a final combination in the sentence, while a final sentence with 6 decimal points has ended. Therefore, it is safe to assume that an incomplete sentence is not a good combination. All possible combinations must have been accepted and compared, and are:\n\nSo, the length of the current question is: 37 characters. The length of the sentence is 16 and the last integer is 10.\n\nTherefore, your job now is to subtract: 10-16=6 (you are always right)\n\nAs a result, the final result will be the result of the hashed combination with the hashed answer. Therefore, \"6\" will be the answer of the encrypted identity.\n\n### Question:\n\"MD\"\n\nRequesting information:\n\nSpecialty: Frank's Colonel Special Operations before performing a Background Check on military drugs in Dodrick Dick Dick Dick's operation.\n\neHarmony\n\neHarmony\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[HCVFRWH]]\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis problem has two aspects.\n\n1. Ciphertext / Plaintext are mapped to each other.\n2. There are encryption and decryption operations.\n\nWhen the problem indicates that the ciphertext and the plaintext are not symmetrical, you can reduce the problem to the encryption and decryption operations. After the transformation is completed, the strings are symmetrical and look very close to the previous map operations. Therefore, the modern string manipulations can be regarded as the same as the problem's rotary transformations.\n\nIn addition, the current minimum O(1) or O(N2) complexity is not an effective solution. The main reason is the condition of CSP that the operations of reading and writing are restricted. And CSP is quite difficult to break without free access to read or write operations.\n\nHowever, you can solve this problem by:\n\n1. Preparing a maximum length of [plaintext] columns to store the plaintext and ciphertext items in a line of writing.\n2. Align the four rows of  \" \" and the four rows of \" # \".\n3. Align the even-numbered rows from right to left and the odd-numbered rows from left to right.\n4. Move all the multinational characters to other columns (not directed writing).\n5. Write on regular characters and the beginning of each multinational string.\n6. Transformation and reverse transformation are as close as possible under the limitation of restrictions.\n7. Any transformation after the restriction of CSP does not affect any content. You do not need to save all the convolution states to process reverse transformations.\n\nHope to see a variety of excellent solutions."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Tag the testing framework to use and describe each field as needed for successful execution.\n- Fixes are necessary for all failing tests before submission of this stage. *Exceptions should be made for packages that are currently awaiting pull requests.*\n- Don't create duplicate cases already provided.\n- Keep names unambiguous so reviewers can generalize the provided results.\n- Supply inputs and expected outputs for each field type when an exact match is not practical.\n- Avoid excessive parentheses when testing multiple arguments.\n- Make use of lowercase letters `a-z`, uppercase letters `A-Z`, numeric characters `0-9`, and special characters; when appropriate, use `_` to replace spaces.\n- Test against the smallest, longest, start and end measures to check for potential edge cases.\n\n### Plaintext Rule:\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z).\n    - Seed: A number between 0-16.\n    - Format: \"Plaintext\", \"Key\", \"Seed\", \"Format\".\n    - Example: \"Cthulhu\", \"crying\", 7, \"Plaintext\"\n- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java\n- Python needs decimal numbers for numbers larger than 1000; use \"[flintstone](https://uricomplex.enlgtsml.com/flip?type=plain&id=Py_43103)\" next to the number for convenience. This is applicable to all languages listed in this step.\n\n**Tests Against Python User Input:**\n```\n\"swfgr|U+2M5|abcdefg\" should return \"FGLTV\"\n`\"swfgr\"+x\"U+2M5\"|pyeval should return \"FGLTV\"\n``swfgr+U+2M5`` should return \"FGLTV\"\n```\n\n**Tests against Python Annotations:**\n- Given no changes, plaintext should be converted into same format as the key.\n- Convert with 5 spaces at the end of ans.\n- The s encapsulation assignation must be performed into \\1,2 correspondingly with the appropriate number.\n- The period [.], semicolon [;] and tilde [~] characters must not be converted.\n\n## Step 3: Write Fixes (lucasad/plaintext/step3)\n\n### Further Instructions:\n\n- Try to solve and implement the mistakes by the first week deadline. This includes the surprise faults given out during the first week.\n- Only do two faults each week and do not guess what the fourth set of faults are for it will be provided as needed in a later week.\n- For lessons 1 & 2, try to make the test closely resemble the \"Other\" example provided during deliberations.\n- In addition, please provide code documentation for each component used in a fix.\n\n## Step 4: Release Your Program\n\nRepositories:\n- [Standard Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext)\n- [Surprise Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext)\n- [Instructions Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext/blob/step2-decrypt/instructions/plaintext.md)"}

Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Part of your job includes helping your bank workers encrypt and decrypt any messages they wish to send. Unfortunately, your bank's core encryption/decryption system was destroyed by hackers, and now their encryption system only needs to be rebuilt and you are being charged with the task.\n\n## Solution\nEnki is an encoding scheme (resembling a encrypting and decrypting scheme) which creates a long string of \"a\"s and \"b\"s that correspond to the encryption key and plaintext characters \\.(The **cipher text** is created by inserting these \"letters\" in the ciphertext as shown in the picture.). Anyone who knows the encryption key can use it to decipher any message.\n\n## Problem Statement\nIt's time to bring lift-off to the top cryptyo-thon!\\nThe Rotating Cipher Challenge tasks you with implementing a simple ciphering algorithm.\\nYou need to break down the message that an attacker sent you into 8-character blocks (of two letters each).\\nThen, using the transformation you get from your teacher, encode these anonymous BANC_SYSTEM cryptic messages.\\nAnd then just like your favorite animated movie, your DAD will be decrypting them into a single message (anything and everything you stored on the computer).\\nGive 'em a second !\nTry to remember your Reportanity skills for build_html()and add_content() to handle the new message.\\nJust to remind you how things work, only the first 16 characters of an edit or comment will be visible on the webpage itself\n\n## Libraries\nYou'll need import the functions from software engineering's build_html()and add_content()or that was a waste of time you just run this tape.\n\n### add_content\nTo use the add_content() function, set ~discription~ to encode the transform found above.\\n\\n`add_content([~plaintext~],~discription~)`\nWhen you're sending to your shopping list, you really need ot send this data so your dad has a full shopping list when he arrives or else he'll come home with a bunch of fruits.\\nThankfully for Chicago shores there's a software engineering class to help out and you should be good to go as long as you can solve this rotation problem\n\n## Encryption/Decryption\nWhen implement the rotdection/encryption above, keep in mind these two preeminent principles:\\n exploser= plaintext\nWhen your nephew sends a software engineering message to the bank, make sure it reaches when and get this hidden message in plain sight.\\n\\n~Neither you nor the bank are supposed to read this~ so don't try to decode it\\noxplosive=engineer\n\n## Set Up\nSince you need to call on library for this challenge, make sure you have imported `add_content()` and it needs to be done right off the bat like the example below. Make sure to give it a name ~temp~.\\n\n### `get_transform(~discription~):`\nonce ~discription~ is figured out, you should get the transform and print it. When plaintext is given as input, one of the 8-chars letter slice \\ represents plaintext's lower-case character and other the upper-case character corresponding to the rotdection/encryption transform. Lets Go!\\n\n\n### `encode(~plaintext~):`\n__Encryption__: Split ~plaintext~ into a list of 8-char length letter slice \\ and apply the rotdection/encryption transform. Use a nested if-else approach to determine whether ~plaintext~ is missing any characters. you'll get an empty string back if the rotdection/encryption transform is not 8-chars.\n\n### encode(~plaintext~):\nround two time to reveal this transform.\\n\\n\nthis rotdection can be written as a for-loop in ~temp~.\\n\\n\n__Decryption__:\nOnce transform ~temp~ is built zero returns 8-char length letter slice \\ and use it with your rotdection/encryption transform to return \\n\\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n__Test 0:__ Select \"Torso\" from dictionary.\n\n__Program Result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Head\\\": \\\"Pussrosfostdke\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Head\\\": A\\n\n\n__Test 1:__ Select \"Hand\" from dictionary.\n\n__Program Result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Hand\\\": Volceefeftdk\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Hand\\\": H\\n\n\n__Test 2:__ Select Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources.\n\n__Program result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources\\\": Volceefeftdk\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources\\\": Racing\\n\n\n## Guidelines\nMake sure to include:\n\nUse ``print`` statrments sparingly, and only use one ``print`` per line of code. Make sure to indent all of your code.\nWrite clean, readable code that's easy to understand.\nUse descriptive variable names throughout your code.\nCode tests are an important part of software engineering."}

For each letter in each text, its corresponding code number x is stored as the ciphertext.\n\nEach number x and its exponent e can uniquely represent each letter in the alphabet with a key value (\\tt 264-301), making it easy to transmit.\n\nThis rule is different from the congruent numbers (\\S04.06 Congruent Numbers.rp) because it adds restrictions.  For the same letter in the plaintext and the same string(e.g., text \"I\", \"WWI\"), the ciphertexts of different plaintexts are not congruent. The ciphertext ciphertext of plaintext \"I\" is always \"213\". Therefore, after the letter is coded as a number, there is no error in transmitting to the destination. It will be decoded to \"I\" and \"WWI\" according to different keys.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    \"\"\"\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n        \n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n    \n    return key_list\n```\n    \nThe \"key_list\" is the ciphertext of the plaintext. After encrypting, the code of each letter corresponds to a ciphertext. You only need to find the correct ciphertext corresponding to the message by comparing the code. The bigger the key_list is, the stronger the security of the ciphertext. At the same time, a large key list is also difficult to calculate.\n\n### The coding method:\n\n1. Write functions:\n    - Find the ciphertext that corresponds to each letter in the plaintext by comparing the code.\n2. Create a method:\n    - User input: Plaintext;Key word.\n    - Call iteration() function to get the ciphertext of the plaintext.\n    - Call decryption() function of the constructed method to find the decryption of each letter.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    '''\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    '''\n\n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n\n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n        \n    return key_list\n\ndef decryption(jeruxe_decrypt, length):\n    size_t = list(range(len(jeruxe_decrypt) - length + 1))\n    letter_list = ['']\n    \n    for t in size_t:\n        sum_ = 0\n\n        for number in jeruxe_decrypt[t:t + length]:\n            sum_ +=(int(number))\n        letter = ASCII_alphabet[(sum_ / (length*e)) % n]\n        \n        letter_list.append(letter)\n        \n    return letter_list\n\ncipher_total_input = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_input_list = iteration(cipher_total_input, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,…\") #算出对应的密文字符\n\n\noutput_result = cipher_input_list + \",\"+ \"]. \"\nprint(output_result)\n```\n\nAfter the iterative process, create a method named \"Decosion(code input, length input, number of key words input)\", which takes \"code\" (iteration() function generates ciphertext), \"length\" (number of consecutive ciphertext), and \"number of key words\" as inputs. Once the message is sent to the destination, the receiver searches for the key list that the enciphered message is fraction of the key list by LAPLACIANtraering.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/). There will be no repeated codes in each key list. Decode the characters corresponding to each code of the key list in order to form the plaintext.\n\n### User input:\n```\ncipher_total_text = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_text_list = iteration(cipher_total_text, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22…..\" #算出对应的密文字符\n```\n\n### Output result:\n\n### User input:\n\n```\nHence, we can construct the dectkon method:\n\ndef decryption(cipher_input_list, length_cipher_list, number_of_key_words):\n    \n    cipher_len = len(cipher_input_list)\n    len_of_selected_key = int(cipher_len / (n *e))\n    \n    normal_key = [cipher_input_list[length-len_of_selected_key:length] for length in range(len,len_of_selected_key+1)]\n    maximal_key = select_list(normal_key) #Select key list by LAPACIANtraing.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/)\n    \n    return_dict = dict()\n    \n    ascii_code_txtlist = ASCII_alphabets_list[normal_key]\n    \n    for each in ascii_code_txtlist:\n        each1 = (each / 24575) % n\n        key = INT_Ascii_alphabets[each1]\n        \n        character = each%n\n        \n        return_dict.update({key: character})\n```\n\nThe decryption method can be used to obtain the plaintext of the key word in the ciphertext."}

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules. The “s_k_n” is a different scheme. The scheme is forenced and the specific encrypt rule is not specified here.\n        \n     \"s_k_n\":340277644805373023] #you can simply use it exactly as in the rule\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \" $S:56M)Ù*z_¿J:MzÄÃ<!--ï\\Eâ‚‚ßâ‰£7â��së)>27S?â��ø$s<xázüùøïœÒé ╯\\à?[^üÿó€ÕâˆÎʹ��{よう<Ｈ１鬏f✐Fw����dE\u0017W+kX xÀFNéŸ$UÌ@*æ'8rןh4µαkT^).j0zìYVÈYýÚ?Ţ�̚\\g#ï6}‡��A�.%Áy쌋T*櫓[^Öh¿ʘ„0∞? qè^[دؤ„̇$ݫTê.C⧻°YçY¦ŞÑó¹ȂÈπ/gŇÂ\u0018֠_]Җc�ٴîò'%™ŋ˩\u0003'):574726143556022745 secs; %b=3 1“’C\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[ get ciphertext without key,\n\n\t\tfor(int i=0;i<1134;i++)\n            {\n\t\t\t\tcipherText.append(\" \" + (((int)(((double)key[i]) * ((double)key[i + 1])))));  //store sub key.You should process key and store the their values in keyarray.\n            }\n\t\t]var  int g=1;\n\t\tint gadd++;\n\t\t]\n\t\t{//store ((double)((double)key[i]) • ((double)key[i + 1])) in subarray\n\n\t\t\tfor(int k = 0;k<1154;k++)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tint s=(((key[k])^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))))%(255>>5);\n\t\t\t\t//{key[k]^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))MOD(255stery5);\n\t\t\t\t// }gadd=0;\n\t\t\t\t// g=g->g[isasan][sub]->g[key]\n\t\t\t\tfor(int n=0;n<25745;n++) //loop key\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t//key++;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t}//*/"}
