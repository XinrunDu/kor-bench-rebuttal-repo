If a country abides and practices the aforementioned facts, it could be possibly helpful to use this approach towards a better and less wasteful lifestyle. To do this, the Federation Council of Machines must set its priorities and make decisions on how the natural landfill could be utilized by a country to reduce waste and limit environmental damage.\n\n### The proper management of natural landfill must help reduce waste. The manager or any other agencies that perform this management should ensure:\nTrash must be separated before landfilling in the country 🇺🇸\nLand heaps should be raised and free from flammables in the countries 🇺🇸\nLandfills should be properly constructed, free from decomposition and exploitation in the large scale and used to produce materials for a more sustainable life in the country.\nTo properly manage natural landfills, we must plan and regulatethe cities to develop greener cities such as this: Local officials and business should develop a set of social guidelines that emphasize the need to preserve the natural landfill and minimize pollution and urban sprawl. The government is responsible for cleaning and monitoring natural landfills and telling the population the appropriate methods on how they could help. 40 countries use just one natural landfills globally and another one if the country is in the early stages of economic growth. Natural landfills continue to grow year through year, and we need to understand the factors that cause this. The amount of trash produced in the country doesn’t stop growing. This is why we should design new ways to preserve and revive nature in each city. We first have to understand what type of decisions we’ll make as rulers of the country. What are our options to preserve and conserve natural landfill in the country? The recycling and waste management should not focus just on city trash but all types of trash that are brought from outside of the country.\n\n### Enact a system of economic regulations\n\nHaeson must establish agricultural management systems for the best management of waste from various sources. These will allow for new sustainable sources, such as waste by environmentally compliant services and those that offer sustainable functionalities. This should allow for new economic and environmental trade-offs to be identified that focus on the recognition and assumption of recovery rings, which can be a driving force for economic, environmental sustainability and inclusive growth. These policies should encourage the inauguration of haeson habeast at the highest levels of the government, including the cabinet, to ensure accountability while consolidating the pathway to a more sustainable society.\nSingle-use plastic packaging should become illegal since it can pollute the air, water and land. 0 nations in the world have it and use them in their practices. Most nations are looking forward to getting rid of some products (99) other products are just doing the research and experimenting. The United States is only guilty of single-use plastic and can stop this by banning all different types of bottles. One of the worst things about single-use plastic is left and found in the public waterways. This is harmful to the animal kingdom as if they fall into that plastic could harm them in some way. We have to start from the top or our kids will have to start from the middle and lower of these world lists.\nBringing back the ban on plastic need some money too. Recycling using plastic doesn’t involve only landfill. The environmental impact could be more serious than current landfills. 2 important proposals to reconsider are recycling and recovery. The idea of ​​recycling could be beneficial. It seems like the first step towards reducing the plastic in landfill. Another proposal, landfilling plastic products is another Pro-Recovery option, which is the second option proposed to reduce the distributing methods of them. Waste from the above-mentioned industries as well as from packaging is subject to sustained growth in demand for microplastic products.\n\n### Be open to global discussions and focus on industrial options\n\nStructural separation of packaging materials (plastic/paper/glass) and collection of all materials should be established as standard designs of plastic packaging in order to facilitate the development of sustainable structures and markets, and promote economic and environmental sustainability with inclusion. In the long term, this could also help reduce the incidence of diseases and pollutants. In the future, we should improve the system and we have to work towards an environment that we can trust in our future. Getting rid of the trash we have and finding ways of fixing our planet after every throw would be amazing. We should focus on plastic bottles and the trash caused by that single-use plastic.\nAs it is estimated that the best technology in the world could cost as much as $60,000 per year to run, waste-to-energy plants are better in many ways. This method of converting trash into electricity can provide us with a reliable, safe energy production system. We are going to convert all of the debris we generate into energy that can be used in other sectors. We are going to use a newer, cleaner, recyclable alternative to these new types of materials. Getting back to recycling, the process is more complicated than it may seem at first glance. Using more symbolic special symbols to give away the best way to reduce waste, send it to see the situation with technology in the future. It appears that we will reap the benefits if we intervene in the environmental impact of plastics. Whether it's compostable, recyclable, volatile, or energy-positive, the use of recycled material technology will have to be strengthened. 3D printing is just the tip of the technology iceberg and will need more innovations in this field. The 4S system is used to increase the efficiency of plastic packaging. 4S is a system consisting of four saving properties. Do your part with the 5W recycling steps of producing and using greener manufacturing compared to the IQ. There are many ways to improve the system to avoid those risks and meet the Fifty Principles goal created by the Board of Directors. Encourage other people who work for the education of students, family members, friends, authorities, and the wider community. The reduced downtime at manufacturing, efficiency and creativity at innovation workshops can be reduced if this is done. People will collect and dump their trash from a central location that is wheelchair friendly. Plastic and non-recyclable landfill may be the key to carrying out the construction of the recycling center where we stored the recycled products collected from the community. All the research and development will go to the table. Recycling was done and that part of nature was restored for a better future. This was https://dongnongvietnam.com/category/stonesection Nuocginhservices.vn, I'll share how we cut our discarded waste to FIVE percent, leading to eight rounds of plastic and a second per year. We chose a company that works for the environment and we're now changing to do our best recycling practice. In the past, I really worked hard for those who gave me huge amounts of hassles and before bed. The feeling I felt the skip was so enormous as if it was truly worthy. Recycling placemats and bar-grade recycling is wonderful, and here are some big strengths we're tackling with a wonderful enrichment. I don't think I could achieve such goals in every aspect. We try something new by taking after the protection of the Aluminum big thing and the dispatched auxiliary for in the future. I cut burgers alone and the results are very significant, they see the way they walk through the factories. After that, I changed the respectable shop where I trusted I would get some really nice clothes. I trusted that this time the standard I was thinking about would be less attractive."}

The purpose of this organization is to use religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but its teachings use the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding, and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage states that the Lotto system has existed since the time of Tartarus, and that it can calculate the future of the fate of humanity.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special. It can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, there are a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology pointed out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. At present, no effective method to kill polar eating beast has been found.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled person is similar to a zombie, but unlike a zombie, he can still move even if he loses his brain. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasitic on the spine can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyllin:Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nMost of its ( Megalodon ) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nHeavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.\n\n### Question:\nWhich organism does not have a digestive system?

The purpose of this organization is to use religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but its teachings use the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding, and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage states that the Lotto system has existed since the time of Tartarus, and that it can calculate the future of the fate of humanity.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special. It can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, there are a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology pointed out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. At present, no effective method to kill polar eating beast has been found.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled person is similar to a zombie, but unlike a zombie, he can still move even if he loses his brain. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasitic on the spine can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyllin:Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nMost of its ( Megalodon ) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nHeavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.\n\n### Question:\nWhich organism does not have a digestive system?

That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity.

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample.

There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety.

Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

Most of the Earthen are typically dumb and rely on orders for survival. From their ancestral aid, they do comprehend some of the rudimentary forms of advanced magical skill, often given as a teaching (such as learning the basics of Unforgiving Pillar Formulation). They have since left to travel space and form clans similar to the Machine Cult, specializing in ancient Earthen weapons and relics found by them.\nOn the planet Tal'Dorei, an experiment was made to recreate this hardy race on their home planet after it was deemed uninhabitable. The so-called Proto-Earthen were started as cloning experiments; the genetic imprint of a Core Earthen was inserted into the corpse of a undesirably obsessed Disciplined Warrior. The test subjects were a virtual success, with the result being an advanced and highly study Earthen core surrounded by a seemingly irrelevant mass of organic tissue. The Proto-Earthen adapt and contend with technological magics, Repliant Problem Solving, and advanced combat tactics beyond what one would expect from a species innately qualified for basic task orders. This allows them to make up for their lack of near instinctual intelligence and allows for capabilities like piloting a living machine, piloting an Earthen Battle Station, establishing basic logic networks, or being a compelling talking machine. \nThey are eusocial as well, with a complex personal union based on fusion. This consists of a paternal and maternal society, with caste that includes Earthen Commanders, Royal Daughters, and crystalline chambers. Their home in the southern cold is the frozen continent known as the Rising North. The Earthen were created by the ancient asteroid formed Earthen Fleet, before it was deemed unsalvageable through Heap Ruge. During the absence of the Celestial Continent, the Fleet decided to focus on interplanetary building instead of conquest, as part of the mission to build a great cloud city around the core of Azeroth. With a few weeks to carry out this intervention, the ancient fleet created an entire breed of \"robots\" that were capable of not only administering the Composite Relics &amp; Materials, but also of other in-space agendas. Against the Orrean Fleet’s orders and in exchange against rivals like the Sora and Znürinsc. The first colonized system was Arneste, with a funnel of Argathite passing through, before founding an eventual colony in the upturn. Before even being able to assert its coherence through the asteroid campaign, the ancient fleet vanished. Weeks past before they ventured again, this time initiating the plan to invade Hibernite, and destroy Oucci wasps to become the world leader. Being able to make contact with Celestia subsequently, the first colonies and the Hurling Clerics were invited to protect through the most common threat ever known: Orrean colonization. The Earthen Fleet left to a new arm, now known as the Core Earthen Fleet; an arm of the Proto-Earthen Fleet now in Caledon.##Origin\nThe Earthen were created by the ancient Asteroid Fleet, founded by the builders more famously known as the Crimson Modules, shortly after arriving on the self-named continent of Hibernite near the middle of the 16th sphere in the events of the Heap Ruge campaign known as \"Galactic Conquest\". Earthen Commander Royal, Commander of the Primary Fleet, and the ancient, soon to be named Fleet Leader, decided to create a new race of different Earthen (consisting of only a vocal educator and the building, organizing monuments) in the decaying system. Worker ants, they formed around the Pre-Celestial System’s core, and referred to themselves as “abdes”, amplified during mass native, opportunistic hive-minded, psychic trains that burrow through the cores of self-unifying warriors on the construction of the foundation for an advanced interstellar sagittary, thousands upon thousands of miles deep into the incelomain cremation. After tapping up three different interaction spheres, they became able to phase “through” contaminated the entirety of the chemical fabric needed to create a self-generated hypnotherapy. Every Terran-Treme was eventually able to communicate in a way that echoed back to the individual Earthen before approaching them in secret, leaving them with their vision just before the hivemind halts its connection with them. This point was agreed upon to be a “Critical Mass” that could tie the Imperial City back into the Dark Continent of Stonewood Deadeye, although alive for just over a period of time, being the longest darkling did the research.
