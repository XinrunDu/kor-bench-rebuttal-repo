Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. ### Answer: [[3]] ### Question: Please evpototnau yf&kS=4. Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. ### Answer: [[29]] ### Question: What are the values of a+1 if 1※a+a = 3? Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]. ### Answer: [[0]] ### Question: We define a custom operation: When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2, If b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2, Otherwise a※b = 24, If the given custom operation is not specified in the rule, u= 12. Suppose that B is a number and a= 13※B※6, find B. ### Best answer for offset is 28. To see why is B=28, first compute 13/6 + 6, what b is periodic and what multiplier M for the a is multiple of b. 13/6 + 6=2.8. So periodic divide from 0 to 12 and repeatedly returns 2.8 because 28 = 24 + 4 and 3 or 12. M2 or 12. Since it's a periodic number too, each Mx represents 2^30-2^5=12 times larger values too, so when combined with the original value like 60^3, it is always firstly subtracted 12 times into 60^5, which will lead to M5=1, can be repeatedly used until the value becomes either 0 or the domain limit. Hence after two adjustments equalize b's value and a's value as 1 and find the sequence of numbers for different a's value like [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768] which has analogous results. Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[28]] ### Answer: [[28]] ### Question: Please evaluate (15※36). ### Best answer for offset is 2. To see why is 6, consider 15/36 + 2 gives 3.8. As 15/6 will also return the most significant fraction in the multiplication of 15/6*36. An it is multiplied by 6 too, which returns 6 for 15*6=90. To avoid this effect, need to use the rule option, which rounds down the fraction, so another example: 14/4+2 =2.9 (15.75 of the fraction can be avoided) To see why b is periodic, there are only 3 prime numbers less than 20, 3, 5, and 7. Compute 15051=15×50=3×5×5×7×5=30×5×5. Remove these five factors output 1, which reveals periodic property. Let's take 8, 8. Divide 8 times from 0 to 40. Then the value at 10 will have a period 48-10=38, only 8 or 38 output repeated. And for 20, the values at 2 with offset 14 and 6 at offset 28 will appear in the same way. Hence, 14/9+9 is unique. Please ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[2]] ### Answer: [[2]] ### Question: Find (3 − 3※2)/2. ### Both a and b are integers. ### Both a and b are integers. ### Best answer for offset is 1. To see why the answer is 7, consider (3949₃※109)/4 = 22"}

Your task is to apply these rules, as well as the Specific operation rule above in order from the highest precedence to the lowest precedence.\n\nNote that the rules mentioned above cannot be used in custom operations that explicitly rely upon them or use them as defaults. That is, if the rule claims that addition of 2 types generally implies multiplication, and a turn also has this result based on that, then any multiplication operators should come after that addition rule in your answer;  likewise for subtractions based on multiplications, or multiplications based on divisions. If a rule is named “A on B” then any corresponding rule must follow (see: decimal point).\n\n### Rationale Operations in the Powers Rule:\n\n• Repeated multiplication of the same number by itself (x1)\n• Anything rational by itself (x2) follows x1\n• Anything irrational by itself (x2) follows x1\nIf operators x1 and x2 differ in kind, then equal orders follow A. If they are the same kind\n\nx1 + x2 = x2, x1 - x2 = x1, x1 x2 = x2 x1, x1 / x2 = x2 / x1, x1 ^ x2 = x1\n\nIf you get any of the operations wrong in your answer resulting in the program having to calculate a partial answer... follow this pattern:\n\nThe operations to the value of the highest precedence are given as numbers in base-2 according to their order from highest to lowest. If you get what you need and find the expression might need help finding a bit of help at any point, get help by the end of the case in which you are caught.\n\nIf the expression is partial, you can divide the number by 2 until the expression implied is the one you have, then add it next to the numbers and write it in that order beginning with the numbers that appear after this."}

If you git cloned the project, then change into the project's folder.\n\n### Run tests\n\nTo run through the tests of this project, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n# remove previous output, if you are running your version of the project for a second time\nrm -f output.json\n\n# run tests. This looks complicated, but it just compiles all the test files and executes them\nnode ./test.js\n\nThis will output a lot of XML and let you know how many tests have passed. If the number is 100%, say Congrats, you should know that you have succeeded!\n\nYou can run utility functions in an extension by calling them directly. For example, you can :\n\n• evaluate custom operation\n• run other operations\n\nFor `pyle` section, you can read more about the custom operations in Utilizree and the expectations Utilizree has in the one-pager here. The Fragments and One-pagers document.\n\n## Review the pyle tests\n\nWe set up some tests to start you off knowing the syntax you need to use. In `test.js`, you will see something like\n\npyle(['mod(6, 2)', '4'),\n('mod(13, 7)', '3'),\n('mod(16, 4)', '2'),\n('mod(18, 15)', '9'),\n('mod(3, 17)', '-1')],\n\n\n\nThere is a string of data in each test. The data has three groups separated by brackets, like this:\n\n( parseInt, parseInt, function )\n\n\nYour test will find groups of data that look like\n\n( [ 'add(1, 2)' ], [ '2' ], 'eval256' )\n\n\nand execute the function. This function should return a string, like '2'.\n\nInside this function, your code should start with a comment saying:\n\nfunction (int_1, int2, function_name).\n\n\n### Example `eval256`\n\nIn the example `eval256`, the function name is `eval256`. If you remember from the review of Requirements, you should have added eval256_options.\n\nYour function should loop through the Pyle section and call eval256 for each scalar computation.\n\n### More detailed example `eval256`\n\nThis answer example shows how eval256 is being executed in `test.js` . In `test.js`, you could execute it like this:\n\n  pyle(['eval256(5, -8)', 'eval256(-3, 4)','eval256(100, 1000)'],\n...\n\n\n\n# Handling errors\n\nTo avoid an error message when running `test.js`, make sure in `util.js` that the syntax of the function call:\n\nfunction (int_1, int2, function_name).\n\n\nsomtimes becomes:\n\n(int_1, int2, function_name).\n\n## Try it for yourself\n\nEvaluate `[source code]` in extensions in the language of your choice. Practice chaining protocols, returning the right values, which button to come back to in each section.\n\nIn `test.js` , our tests nerver return an error, even when there is an error in your code. You will need to design tests like this to properly assess your code.\n\n### Somehow Implement All The Tests\n\nCongratulations! Run `test.js` and see how many of these tests are passing. In general, remember that when you see these blocks in the tests:\n\n( statement list, [ YOUR RESULT ], function_name )\n\n\n\nThis means you should call `util.utilize()`, passing in one of the cases from the test.\n\nYou could logically place your assertions anywhere, but we would recommend that you put them at the end of the function, inside the if statement.\n\n### Function comprises trivial code\n\nYou should try to make your test function as small as feasible. That is, you should attempt to change as little code as possible when adding functionality to the program.\n\nIn this section, you merely need to find the boolean value of a binary operation. Reusing code should not be difficult, as your program is fairly modular when it comes to the shape of the actual test sections, each of which have unique permutations of variables.\n\n#### Test cases\n\nSome test cases will test all of the operations in the test, while others will simply test non-integer input.\n\n• Non-integer operations should be evaluated.\n• Integer and non-integer operations should be handled identically.

When evaluating each operation, the support system will try to read the input. When it cannot read the given input as either an int or a mark, it will return an error. The 'int' and 'mark' flags bypass direct evaluation.\n\nBy setting 'flags: function()` to return {bool}, you will have implicit control over NumArc.

How to define and solve inequalities| Khan Academy. Watchperate. 2:07\n\n### Video Categories:\n\nHow to Define and Solve Inequalities?\n\n### Mathematics: Inequalities\n\nInequalities and absolute value can be used in maximization and minimization problems to model situations where it is not possible to define an exact solution. Learn what an inequality is, how to solve them, and examples. Overview Inequalities and absolute value can be used in models where it is not possible to have an exact solution. In Sales Tax and Interest Rates, another example is when you try to find a model of the amount you have in your account after you make a multiple-day deposit when you don’t know that amount upfront. Overview Inequalities in the form ( ) ≥ ( ) can be solved by looking for values of that satisfy both sides of the inequality. If ( ) and ( ) represent some number, you can increase until you no longer satisfy the inequality or decrease until you satisfy both sides of the inequality. Solving Inequalities For beginning Algebra II students, the process of solving a linear inequality may appear quite the challenge. The process for solving a linear inequality is exactly the same as the process for solving a linear equation (adding or subtracting then solving for the variable,) however, we have one differing requirement for inequalities. The solution must only include solutions that satisfy the inequality. For an inequality á (+/-) <. The solution must include values that can satisfy the highlighted portion. Therefore, if you come across the inequality ( ) > (@), do NOT include -3 assumptions are that there is a greater amount of \"product\" produced with some particular yield. Example 1: With fertilizers, it is cheaper to get more quantity at a time rather than to use less on many plants assuming that every kilogram we save is the same amount of plant food. Explore this assumption with an inequality. Yield A Crops delivered assumes that the farmer has enough fertile soil, suitable weather, and good seeds. Given that, the farmer expects to be able to deliver 144 kilograms of a crop. Assuming that our farmer can only select yield from either 120, 140, or 160 kg of that crop rate, select the most productive rate of delivery considering an average of (60 + 60 + 50) = 150 kilograms per hectare. Explore this assumption Assume that the farmer should be able to farm, at a minimum, 200 kilograms of a certain crop. Consider three possible farming rates: 180, 200, and 220. Suppose that each 30-kilogram rate requires 15 kilograms of fertilizer, each 40-kilogram rate requires 20 kilograms of fertilizer, and each 50-kilogram requires the full 25 kilograms. Calculate the cost (sum up the total cost of fertilizer) associated with each farming rate, considering that one hectare of farm land can produce in a minimum (according to our assumption) of 200 kilograms of hypothetical crop. Based on these measurements, is it better to farm 180 kg of the hypothetical crop per hectare, 200 kg, or 220 kg per hectare? Solution With all these assumptions; You are supposed to the right-hand side of the inequality to coincide with the left or bottom side of the inequality to give the value for x.. Part (a) of the graphCube of a surface area of\nWhen the right-hand side of the inequality satisfies the left side or bottom side of the inequality, then the solution is . Part (b) of the graph Measures of Spread How to Identify Natural Convection In most scientific attempts to forecast conditions and possible causes of changing situations. Further, positive changes in weather conditions are given by three main causes: Pour over convection movement, weather changes, and anaerobic gas-forming weather changes. The movement of the pressure surface should be natural in nature, whether it is natural or not, in general convection is formed. And how to identify micro-convection that occurs in a flat segment down to the level of the earth. Water to form a warm layer of temperature. The more hot things come out of, and all this is done under (gas) pressure, which causes the mask to turn over below. This movement will further cause certain movements to be formed between colder layers of air and hotter water layers, and this movement is a one-dimensional movement, which is propagated by vertical wind pipes at speeds of up to 300. meters, and in air, which is separated at the same rate , Winds move in a spiral motion in the fork among each other. And how to establish and identify convection, I speak to those familiar with the hot wind salt in certain areas of the EAS. When the gas of this area is heated and water evaporates, a motion is formed in the opposite direction to vertical movement, which occurs as hot water is spread and is characterized by two forms when it is classified, which become clouds and thunderstorms. And in this section I will explain in detail and the relationship of natural convection areas above and below us. Refer all water under the air is formed or spread from under the sun, and how to identify and determine the rotation of this movement will come, when the hot air, which is taken from the land, begins to cover the receiver, which was planted on the land, causing dust clouds to rise to the level of tho, and this movement prevalent. In these clouds, when a gallery is very close to the ground, hot air rises or a hot wind is formed on the upper part, dust clouds collapse, which gets cold, causing the dust to fall. There are falling creatures. The yellow cloud is spread until the boundaries of the land are formed, and wind is formed again, departing from the land and traveling and falling again with dust. A yellow color cloud was then formed. This describes the first form of natural convection movement, which creates an effect associated with the cooling of the air that encloses the surface of the heat and produces dust clouds. Conversely, when moving air spreads outward at high levels, it causes dust to rise. This is low because of cold winds. And how to identify solar radiation. In order to determine the dispersion of these dispersions, the detailed effect produced by the absorption or reflection of solar radiation. Contribution to the development of natural convection, and this thermal or angular distribution of the other, which then gives a clear image of this. The cold is marked with low heat and hot temperatures as \"color\". When you reach the home of the column, a column of hot air is produced height (700), so the direction of the wind axis is displaced, and the direction of the wind in the column is pierced through the axis and returns from There is a call to a low heat called (track) and the inflow of such cold wind into it causes high pressure, which will be spread in the environment, this spreading is what we have def. National convection, which is very popular and helps to sustain, The life of any desert environment. The vital phenomenon occurs in the air, regardless of how strong convection is, and it becomes an incomprehensible illusion. TERMS THAT SHOULD KNOW Know the state of the blast, known as the \"air stream\", map that in some humidity conditions here (Hydrometric maps) the condition of the air is known for the country placed in the environment (Main maps) and the area of its direction. By knowing these maps, we can easily identify the presence of convection and local winds which are formed in the environment during the hot hours available in the light. When the red line is drawn on the map, the strength of the speed of the movement created by the natural convection arises from place to place. By describing the other areas on the map, quite good at nostral and internal weather. It is advisable that the air flow of the scene in the environment is constant, although the speed of the movement of wind gusts at random locations is affected. Warm A warm air mass will be much warmer than its surrounding air, in contrast to cold air will feel cooler, which is caused by heating of air. Consider the fixed, stable movement, as in the atmosphere, the sun heats as the day progresses, that air starts to rise in the area on the ground, and the air under the air soothes, and in the area the air heats up. In the air near the rotation of the air shining reaches the point of cooling, and therefore feel that these masses are cooler while free"}
