Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given cipher rule, the given ciphertext \"PR\" will be decrypted as \"[SH]\". Here's how the decryption process proceeds:\n\n1. The ciphertext \"PR\" can be divided into two 5-character blocks: \"PR\" and \"\".\n2. The grid index for each block:\n   - For the first block (\"PR\"): grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0.\n   - For the second block (\"\"): grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 1.\n3. Determine the positions of characters in the grid:\n   - \"P\" in the first grid: row = 1, col = 2\n   - \"R\" in the first grid: row = 4, col = 2\n   - \" \" in the second grid: row = 1, col = 7\n   - The characters \"J\" are not present in the provided given plaintext, hence not encrypted and ignored.\n4. Obtain the encrypted characters:\n   - \"P\" in the first grid: row+1, col+1 = 2,3 (position \"SH\")\n   - \"R\" in the first grid: row+1, col+1 = 3,3 (no character at this position, encrypted char will be another \"R\")\n   - \" \" in the second grid, row,col = 1,7. (no character at this position, encrypted char will be another \" \")\n\n5. The decrypted characters:\n   - \"S\" from \"SH\"\n   - \"R\" from \"RR\" (Notice the order in which encrypted characters from the same position in the grid are combined is \"RSH\")\n   - \" \" is not present in the grid at the second block, hence it is ignored.\n\nFinal Decrypted String: \"[SH]\""}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given ciphertext \"H\" when encrypted with the specified rules results in the inner_disk value 'JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO'. Hence, the first character 'H' in the plaintext is mapped to the character 'K' in the inner_disk.\n\nAfter every 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk rotates by 5 characters. When 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk will be oriented as 'ASDFGHJQTKRYNMIUBVCXW', leaving a single 'K' character in its starting position after rotation.\n\nNow, as per the decryption rules, we need to un-encrypt this ciphertext. The first step is to find the corresponding positions of the 'K' character in the outer_disk and inner_disk strings. In the outer_disk, the 'K' is in the 8th position, while in the inner_disk, 'K' is at position 2.\n\nNow, we rotate the inner_disk to the right by 5 characters, giving us the new positions of the characters in the inner_disk string: 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQRSTUOPYTF'. The 'K' has moved to the starting position ('2nd') character in the inner_disk, which is indeed the original plaintext character that was encrypted.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer for ciphertext \"H\" with period 11 and increment 5 is: [[\"K\"]] (note that the answer appears as uppercase due to the given initialization of the outer_disk and inner_disk strings)."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]] (decrypted answer using the specified rules)\n\nHere's how we applied the decryption steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2. For each character c in the ciphertext (in this case, \"INIEIWYUXIU\"):\n   * Find character c on the Reel: \"I\" is on the second position in Reel1, \"N\" is at the fourth position, and so on.\n   * Replace \"I\" on Reel1 with the next character (which is the first character on Reel2): \"O\".\n   * Replace \"N\" on Reel1 with the previous character on Reel1 (which is the last character on Reel1). This is necessary, as \"N\" is at the end of the Reel. Therefore, \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n   * Move to the next Reel.\n\n3. Now we're at Reel2, and all characters \"O\", \"N\", \"E\", \"I\", \"W\", \"Y\", and \"U\" are at the correct positions.\n4. For \"U\" (third character), we go around to the start of the Reel (which is the last character) and come back to the second character (which becomes third in Reel2). Next character in order is \"X\". Therefore, \"U\" is replaced by \"X\".\n5. \"N\" is now at the second position, and it goes around to the start to get the previous character on Reel2. This occurs to be \"E\", so \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n6. \"[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]]\" is the decrypted plaintext.

Removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, removing the letter Q, and converting all letters to uppercase will result in \"VB\".\n 2. \"VB\" consists of two-letter groups.\n 3. In Gird1 and Gird4, find the position of the first letter and the second letter for \"V\" and \"B\". In Gird1, the positions of \"V\" and \"B\" are (1, 2) and (5, 4), respectively. And in Gird4, the positions of \"V\" and \"B\" are (4, 5) and (2, 1), respectively.\n 4. In Gird2 and Gird3, find the letters corresponding to these two positions for \"V\" and \"B\". Gird2: (1, 2) corresponds to \"E\"; Gird3: (1, 2) corresponds to \"E\".\n 5. The final decrypted answer is \"BE\", which corresponds to \"B\" and \"E\" in Gird2 and Gird3.\n 6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AK]]\n\nExplanation of the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"KP\". In this rule, punctuation and spaces are not considered, so the alphabet characters are the only inputs.\n\n2. For \"KP\", there are two characters - \"K\" and \"P\". No punctuation and no J. We remove them. The resulting plaintext is \"K\" and \"P\".\n\n3. In the 5x5 grid, the coordinates of \"K\" are (4,1) and the coordinates of \"P\" are (2,4). Although there are 5 characters in the grid, we are told that there's no J, so we only use the remaining characters A-Z without J.\n\n4. The coordinates are arranged in the order: 286\n\n5. First, we find the row coordinates and read them in order: 26\n\n6. Next, we find the column coordinates and separate them into two halves: 2,4\n\n7. Next, read each half of the column coordinates, find the corresponding character in the grid using their row and column positions.\n\n8. For today, let's focus on the second half, the column coordinates: 2,4. Starting with the first element (4): we find the corresponding character, \"Z\". So, the second half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"Z\".\n\n9. Next, focus on the first half, the row coordinates: 2,6. The first element (2) corresponds to \"E\". So, the first half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"E\".\n\n10. The decrypted answer in plaintext is [[\"E\",\"Z\"]] or simply \"ZE\". Notice that the order of the characters in the plaintext is the opposite of the original order in the ciphertext.\n\nFollowing the decryption property, the final result in plaintext is \"ZE\". So, the answer to the given problem is [[\"ZE\"]] (double-square brackets encapsulating the decrypted answer)."}

Convert the given ciphertext \"LXRPWXXKEAG\" into uppercase letters.\n2. Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from the plaintext.\n3.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"777898898\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

L1_col=4, L2_row=5.

Divide the ciphertext by the asterisks: \"C*KW*VA*HC*B#*\" -> [\"C*KW*VA*HC*B\",\"#\"]\n\n2. Fill the consecutive asterisks with each letter in the keyword upwards, starting with the third asterisk: C*KW*VA*HC*B -> \"C*H*W*DA*CB*\"\n\n3. Remove the asterisks one by one while keeping the letters unchanged, starting from the third asterisk and gradually filling the 5 lines:\n\t* Third asterisk removed: \"CHWDACB\" -> \"CHWDACB\"\n\t* Second asterisk removed: \"CHWDACB\" -> \"CHWDABC\"\n\t* First asterisk removed: \"CHWDABC\" -> \"CHWDABC\"\n\t* Fourth asterisk removed: \"CHWDABC\" -> \"CHWADBC\"\n\t* Fifth asterisk removed: \"CHWADBC\" -> \"CHWADB\"\n4. The fifth line (CHWADB) has only one character missing, so the decrypted plaintext is \"HEVDACB\" (grouped by asterisks to match the original ciphertext): \"HEVDACB*\"\n\n5. Since there's still one asterisk left in the list (\"C*KW*VA*HC*B\",\"#\"), we read the last line (B#) upwards: \"BC#\" -> \"BC\" -> \"B\"\n\n6. The decrypted plaintext is: [[\"HEVDACB\",\"B\"]]. We encapsulate it within double square brackets: [[\"HEVDACB\",\"B\"]]\n\nNote: If the ciphertext had different asterisks patterns, the process would be completely different, and the encryption/decryption steps would also change accordingly."}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The given ciphertext is \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\", which is divided into blocks of 16 letters as follows:\n   - Block 1: \"#CVRA\"\n   - Block 2: \"VDGIR#N\"\n   - Block 3: \"RA\"\n   - Block 4: \"RAF##\"\n   - Block 5: \"#A\"\n\n2. For each block, we read the letters visible through the white holes in the template and place them in the same order in a new grid. For example, for Block 1:\n```\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      \nReading the letters through the template, the letters in the grid are mailed in the order \"#CV\"\n\nWe rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees and read the next set of visible letters in the same order, which is \" A\".\n\nIn the new grid, with the template rotated, the letters are aligned as follows, \"CV A\".\n```\n3.

We can break down the encryption steps into smaller steps:\n   a. For the first character 'P', find the row and column of 'P' in the matrix. It is (3, 6).\n   b. The encrypted character at position (3, 6) is 'K'.\n   c. Repeat the same process for 'F'. It is (2, 2). The encrypted character at position (2, 2) is 'J'.\n\n3. Now we can concatenate the encrypted characters to get the encrypted ciphertext: [\"PK\", \"JF\"]\n   a. The encrypted characters in each row are separated by spaces.\n   b. We concatenate these rows to get the final ciphertext: \"PFKGVR\"\n\n4. To decrypt, we repeat the steps for each half of the ciphertext and concatenate the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n   a. For the upper half \"PF\", decrypt \"P\" as (2, 2) and \"F\" as (3, 6).\n    - The decrypted characters are 'P' and 'F'.\n    - Now concatenate these characters to get the final plaintext: \"PF\".\n   b.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A] \\\\[A] (where \"A\" is the decrypted uppercase letter from the given ciphertext \"11111110\").\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into 8-bit chunks:\n- The first chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The second chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The third chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The fourth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The fifth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The sixth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The seventh chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The eighth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n2. Apply the permutation (in ;; notation used in data cipher):\n- The reversed permutation is (7, 3; 3, 7; 1, 7; 1, 3; 2, 7; 2, 1; 4, 1; 4, 7)\n\n- The first chunk's;; notation: \"7 3\"\n- The second chunk's;; notation: \"3 7\"\n- The third chunk's;; notation: \"1 7\"\n- The fourth chunk's;; notation: \"1 3\"\n- The fifth chunk's;; notation: \"2 7\"\n- The sixth chunk's;; notation: \"2 1\"\n- The seventh chunk's;; notation: \"4 1\"\n- The eighth chunk's;; notation: \"4 7\"\n3. After applying the inverse permutation table; we get the decrypted chunk:\n- The first chunk: \"2\" (Bitstring \"10\")\n- The second chunk: \"7\" (Bitstring \"11\")\n- The third chunk: \"4\" (Bitstring \"100\")\n- The fourth chunk: \"3\" (Bitstring \"01\")\n- The fifth chunk: \"6\" (Bitstring \"110\")\n- The sixth chunk: \"5\" (Bitstring \"101\")\n- The seventh chunk: \"1\" (Bitstring \"1\")\n- The eighth chunk: \"1\" (Bitstring \"1\")\n4. To get the decrypted character, we apply the inverse of the XOR operation:\n- The first chunk is \"2\" (decimal 14). Decimal 14 == \"A\" ASCII value, so the first decrypted letter is \"A\".\n- For the second chunk, \"7\" (decimal 11), which is \"M\" ASCII value. \"M\" is not in our alphabet, so something went wrong. Let's continue with the next chunk.\n- The third chunk is \"4\" (decimal 4). Decimal 4 == \"D\" ASCII value. So the third decrypted letter is \"D\".\n- The fourth chunk is \"3\" (decimal 3). Decimal 3 == \"C\" ASCII value.\n- The fifth chunk is \"6\" (decimal 6). Decimal 6 == \"F\" ASCII value. The seventh chunk stays \"1\".\n- The sixth chunk is \"5\" (decimal 5). Decimal 5 == \"E\" ASCII value.\n- The eighth chunk is also \"1\".\n\nSo the final decrypted answer in the double square brackets is: [[\"D\",\"A\"]]"}

After applying the decryption steps, the result is:\n\n[[\"HICTMHLS\", \"ACIDHPW\", \"UYNGQTF\"]]\n\nThis output represents a string of uppercase letters and spaces. To decode this output in the format you specified, we would concatenate the encryption of each block in the form of double square brackets:\n\n\"[HICHTMHSLACAIDHPWUYNGQTFWBCDOF]\"\n\nSo the decoded answer is: \"HICTMHLS ACIDHPW UYNGQTF WEBBCDOF\". This seems to be a concatenation of 6 strings, which may be the original plaintext padded with null characters (\\x00) to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. After removing the null characters (\\x00), the result should be:\n\n\"HICTMHLS ACIDHPW UYNGQTF WEBBCDOF LALA\"\n\nThe last string \"LALA\" doesn't match any of the given rules, so we assume it's likely an error. Therefore, the decrypted text is \"HICTMHLS ACIDHPW UYNGQTF WEBBCDOF\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C2AE]]\n\n(The hexadecimal representation of the encrypted \"FW\" using the given cipher rule is \"C2AE\", encapsulated in double square brackets.)\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n1. Padding: Since \"FW\" does not have an 8-byte multiple, we add \\x00 at the end to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. (After padding, the plaintext becomes \"F allegations0WP\\x00.\")\n2. Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Converting each block to bytes and applying XOR with the key (KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF').\n   - Using the S_BOX: Replace the high and low 4 bits of each byte before stitching them together and then applying another XOR with the key. In this case, \"F algorithms\" becomes \"D H computations\".\n   - Because 8 bit is a single byte, we only need to rotate each byte one bit to the left. After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Both encrypted bytes produce their respective hexadecimal representations: \"C2A\" and \"WHAT\".\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate the hexadecimal strings to form the final ciphertext: \"C2AWHAT\".\n6. The result is \"[[C2AWHAT]]\"."}

Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11. Decrypted answer: [\"A\"]\n\nSo, the answer to the given ciphertext \"4\" would be:\n[[\"A\"]]"}
