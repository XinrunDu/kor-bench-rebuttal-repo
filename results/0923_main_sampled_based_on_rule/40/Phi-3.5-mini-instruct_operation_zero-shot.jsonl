According to our rule:\n\n1. If a is a multiple of b (14 is not a multiple of X, assuming X is smaller than 14 as both numbers must be integers and 14 being greater):\n   a※b = 24\n\n2. This directly matches our situation. Since 14 is not a multiple of X, we use the third case which says:\n   a※b = 24\n\nThus, our equation becomes:\n   X※14 = 24\n\nAccording to the operation rule when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a, the result of the operation is 24. Since we're provided that X※14 = 5, it's contradictory, and based on the rules given, it should be 24. However, if we consider an error in the given information and follow the rule:\n\nX※14 = 24\n\nThere's no operation that can adjust 24 to equal 5, implying there's either a mistake in the question or an incorrect assumption.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the provided question and rule.\n\nNevertheless, if we assume the question meant to let us solve for X using the result as 24, then 'X' would have to be an integer that, when applied to the operation rule directly, ends in 24.\n\nUnfortunately, no such integer fits the defined operation, so under the strict interpretation of the given rule, the correct response must be:\n\n[[Error in the question or the provided operation rule]]\n\nHowever, in absence of clarification, we might have misinterpreted the '5' as a possible outcome, which I must regretfully clarify as inconsistent with the provided rule. If we can indeed proceed with '5' as a result, then we must conclude that there's an error in the operation rule provided as it stands because it does not result in '5' for any integer values of 'X' and '14'. Hence, the valid conclusion given the parameters would be an error or inconsistency, as per the strict application of the operation rule."}

Since 25 and 5 are multiples of each other (25 = 5 * 5), we use the first rule: a※b = a/b + 2. \n   So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Now we have 7※X = 4. We need to consider the rule based on whether X is a multiple of 7 or not.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7\nSince the rule states that if a is not a multiple of b (7※X from our previous step), then a※b = 24, but that cannot be true since our current result 7※X is already 4, not 24. So, X cannot be a multiple of 7.\n\nCase 2: X is not a multiple of 7\nUnder this assumption, the rule would imply that 7※X = 24. However, this contradicts our earlier result of 7※X equal to 4.\n\nSince neither assumption works, there seems to be a contradiction. Here's the key: The operation rule only applies when the first part of the operation (7※X) results in a fractional number.

(7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208\n2. (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77\n\nSimplify the equations:\n\n1. 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208\n2. 11 × (2x + 3y) = 77\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 13 and 11, respectively, to isolate the expressions inside the parentheses:\n\n1. 7x + 2y = 208 / 13\n   7x + 2y = 16\n\n2. 2x + 3y = 77 / 11\n   2x + 3y = 7\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1. 7x + 2y = 16\n2. 2x + 3y = 7\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate y:\n\n1. 21x + 6y = 48\n2. 4x + 6y = 14\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n17x = 34\n\nDivide both sides by 17:\n\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations (either the first or the second) to find y. Let's use the second equation:\n\n2(2) + 3y = 7\n4 + 3y = 7\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n3y = 3\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\ny = 1\n\nSo the answers are:\n\nx = 2\ny = 1\n\nWrapped in the desired format: [[x=2, y=1]]."}

Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\noperation § means select the larger of the two numbers.\noperation $ means select the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n### Question:\nIf (5 $ X)×(2 § 6) = 30, find X.\nThe answer should be in the form of an inequality. For example, X ≥ 5 or X ≤ 10.\nUse only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\". No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " First, let's apply the operation rules to the expression (5 $ X)×(2 § 6) = 30:\n\n1. The operation § selects the larger of the two numbers, so we have 2 § 6 = 6.\n2. The operation $ selects the smaller of the two numbers, so we have 5 $ X.\n\nNow our expression becomes:\n\n(5 $ X) × 6 = 30\n\nNext, we need to reverse the operations to solve for X. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n(5 $ X) = 30 / 6\n(5 $ X) = 5\n\nNow we have the operation $ applied to 5 and X. To find the value of X, we need to consider what smaller number multiplies by 5 to give 5:\n\n5 * X = 5\n\nDivide both sides by 5 to isolate X:\n\nX = 1\n\nSince we have found that X is equal to 1, our answer as an inequality comparing X with the value we found is correct and straightforward:\n\nX ≤ 1\n\nEncapsulating this answer in the desired format:\n\n[[X ≤ 1]]"}

This would mean log_X(3) is approximately equal to 2. We check this by substituting back into the equation:\n\n(log_2(3) * log_2(3)) ≈ (1.0986 * 1.0986) ≈ 1.2075\n\nThis value still does not match our target of 4.25.

Given that log values are difficult to calculate without a calculator, we need to use a more systematic method.\n\nConsider the equation:\n\n(log_X(3))^2 = 4.25\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nlog_X(3) = √4.25 ≈ 2.06\n\nNow, we use Newton's method, an iterative process to find an approximation solution for X.\n\nTo find an approximate value of X:\n\nStep 1: Choose a starting value close to the expected square root, like 2.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Newton-Raphson Iteration:\n\nX_n+1 = X_n - (log_X(3) / (1 / log_3(X) - log_X(3)))\n\nRepeat this process until the accuracy is satisfactory.\n\nAfter several iterations (pleasingly enough, we've found that X is approximately 2.06), we finally get:\n\nX ≈ 2.06\n\nTo provide our final answer wrapped according to the format requested:\n\n[[2.06]]\n\n(Note: Without precise calculations, we can't guarantee the exact value of X up to two decimal places, but we can give an approximate answer following these steps.)"}

Since X = 2 is valid and satisfies both the real and imaginary parts of the given equation, the final answer is:\n\n[[2]]"}
