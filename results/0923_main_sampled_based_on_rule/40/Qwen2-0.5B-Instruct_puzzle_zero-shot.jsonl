This means that for the first 3 letters, we can choose 3 of the 5 given letters (and possibly some possible rearrangements of letters, but since we are dealing with the 3 state and we have 3 letters), while for the 3 state, we need to choose 3 of the 5 letters.

Every time you happen to encounter a permutation of the letters that exactly fits one of the words on the grid, use it as a solution for that word. \n\nFor this case, you need to find a hidden word, for which you can only backtrack the following specific layout:\n\n1- ROW 12, COLUMN 1 2- COLUMN 1 3- ROW 12, COLUMN 3 4- ROW 10, COLUMN 5 5- ROW 8, COLUMN 3 6- ROW 12, COLUMN 2 7- ROW 8, COLUMN 2 8- COLUMN 1 9- ROW 1, COLUMN 2 10- COLUMN 1\n\nHint: 1- COLUMN 1 2- ROW 12 3- COLUMN 3 4- ROW 2 5- COLUMN 3, 6- REQUIRE AT LEAST 1 LETTER 1- COLUMN 5 2- COLUMN 2, 3- ROW 4, 4- COLUMN 1 5- ROW 1 6- COLUMN 3 and 7- COLUMN 5 8- ROW 2 9- COLUMN 5 10- COLUMN 2\n\nThe above happens to be the answer."}
