Now please help me with this custom operation question. I need you to provide me with the predefined operation rule, as well as a question and its answer. I specifically ask you to ensure the answers you output are single numbers enclosed within double square brackets, providing you with [[answer]]. If there are multiple correct answers, please separate them or sort their combinations in ascending order with a comma. Please pay attention to the specifics of the rule given in the previous question and ensure that your final answer is compliant with that rule. Maybe you could also explain the concepts behind the custom operation rule more elaborately to better understand how it works. Well, um well, alright. Okay, we'll do a little exercise on custom operations. Firstly, we have a pretty long rule. It says:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nSecondly, let's have a look at one of the questions you provided:\n\n### Question:\nCompute 5※25.\n\nNow, as you mentioned, we must determine the predefined operation rule for custom operations first.\n\n### Answer:\nElementary one: a※b = a / b + 2 (a multiple of b, a / b + 2)\nElementary two: a※b = b / a + 2 (b multiple of a, b / a + 2)\nElementary three: a※b = 24 (if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a).\n\nNow, let's apply the rule to your question:\n\n### Question:\nCompute 5※25.\n\nFirstly, 5 is not a multiple of 25, so applying the third case of the rule, we get 24.\n\nFinally, ensure that your answer is single number and encloses it in double square brackets, like \"[[24]]\".\n\nThis custom operation rule is based on the operation of division with a small difference added.\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a small modification to the rule. When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a / b + C (this applies to the condition when b is a multiple of a as well); when b is a multiple of a, a※b = b / a + C (here we switched the conditions of the multiplication to division); if a is a multiple of b but not b is a multiple of a, a※b = 24, where C is a parameter. Given that: 10 ※ 2 = 9, find C.\n\n### Answer:\n4, just as you already got.\n\nFIRST, quick example with two problems. We have two \"operations\". They can be additions, multiplications,........ we have an operation just as you requested. The concept of division is impossible under our operation rule as it is not possible that a number divided by another number is larger than one.\n\nConsequently, it is impossible for 10 ※ 2 = 9 \n\nBelow, somebody with the result:\n\n\n\nNow, let's try another example with more than one operation:\n\nLet's try dividing by the resulting number. According to this rule, the operation should be performed in reverse:\n\nSame as the example of division by an even number:\n\nBy multiplying those values with the given parameter, we get to 24.\n\nBelow is an example of multiplication of the result with the given parameter:\n\nNow we have the given question:\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a small modification to the rule. When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a / b + C (this applies to the condition when b is a multiple of a as well); when b is a multiple of a, a※b = b / a + C (here we switched the conditions of the multiplication to division); if a is a multiple of b but not b is a multiple of a, a※b = 24, where C is a parameter. Given that: 10 ※ 2 = 9, find C.\n\n### Answer:\n4, just as you already got.\n\nWHAT WE CAN SAY is unity, no division operation.\n\nThese rules are impossible under the existing operation rules. That's why, in fact 10 ◦ 2 = 9 is wrong according to basic rules. If indeed you have found this, it is an improvement in your mathematical ability at mathematical arithmetics.\n\nYou are asking for a detailed and precise explanation of the custom operation rule. This is where, out of the whole set of existing rules, we find the following rule \"Elementary One\":\n\n1. a※b = a b + 2 (a multiple of b, a b + 2)\n2. a※b = b a + 2 (b multiple of a, b a + 2)\n3. a※b = 24 (a multiple of b, but not b is a multiple of a, a b + 2).\n\nGiven that, if 'a' is a multiple of 'b', to check if the result 'a※b equals 24', you need to check yet another condition - which is that the 'b' value should not be a multiple of 'a'.\n\nYour question was based on the rule where 'b' is a multiple of 'a'. It appears that this rule is applicable to the first solution, but the second solution only applies when 'a' is not a multiple of 'b'. So it suggests that you must apply multiple solutions depending on the specific value of 'a' and 'b' in a multiple of (2 - 'a') condition and not multiple values based on the condition 'b ≠ a' in a multiple of (2 - 'b') condition. So, you have to check both rules for the specific sub-cases in the specified problem."}

The 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 represents a different level, but they all mean filled, and the next number means in the next level. \nPlease figure out the position of the box which has more than half of the boxes filled.\nIf there is more than one box like that, find the smallest value, try to explain the reasons, and do not give blanket answers such as \"No one\" \"There is only one\".\nPlease read the problems from left to right and from top to bottom.\nIf there are many boxes, please try to present them in one picture in that order, including above box number, so as to be easier to understand, please use English words.\n\n1)\n\nWhat you're looking for is the dividing point (dotted line), the line is right the longest division until it reaches the lowest, and when the longest grows to 10m and the lowest grows to 0m, the line divides into the dividing point.\nSo there are totally 4 divisions, they are A,B,C,D respectively.\nFrom picture 1, the block A you would look at filling from bottom left to top right is A when drawing right-left diagonals, the block B you would look at filling from bottom left to top right is B when drawing up-down diagonals.\nTherefore, A,B,C,D divided into A&C,B&C,D/AB,AB/A,B/C,D/AB,AB/-AB,AB/A,BC,A/AB,ABC,BD.BD/AB,AB/A,BA,BC,B/AB,BC/BD,AB/D,Properties,DOR,AB/O,BC/O,Does O/BA,BC/O,Properties is ABCB / OAB,Properties,BD/ABC,AB/A and 100%. Therefore, the answer is B,C and A&B&C,D/AB have these particular proportions. \nBut the word ABCB top=while D =Sc.-Yes/No-->\n\n### Question:\nThe picture below is the mental model of the last question.\n\n1. From picture 1, we know the total boxes to be divided is 40\n2. From the diagram, we see the blue line is the longest one, therefore the dividing point is the blue adjacent line to the right of it. So now there's 4 divisions.\n3. From the right side of the line, box number C has been 1 filled, so consecutive box number C has more than half of the boxes filled thus the translated block is C, and box number A has 10 filled, the translated block is A wider than above. The fill number is 100%\n4. Then from A, you have the lower right corner B0, B1, B3, B4. The translated block number is 100% because it only has 5 filled flat blocks. \n5. From A, you have BC/ABC and D. The translated block number is 100% because it only has 5 filled flat blocks.\n6. Finally, A/B/ABC/B/D, in lines ABC/B the filled blocks 27+1= 28 parts (AB/C is emptied, B/D is nonempty) and A is full, so while D is nonempty, thus the translated area of block A is 1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5= 1.73 This is the least value since all parts are equal otherwise they should be 1.16,1.3,1.5+=1.73 more than=property;. is translated block number is 100%; the translated block of block A is 1.73.\n\nPlease recall that there are three boxes filled down left up right.\nReturn the number of boxes to be filled.\nIn other words, \"read\" the right top right bottom left in order from left to right and from top to bottom, and the number of filled boxes is the number of boxes in the complete line.\nPlease make it into an integer, the integer number tells you how filled up the box is.

(X①2)②3 = (X+(2^2))×3 = (X+4)×3 = 3X+12.\n\nTherefore, (X①2)②3 is 3X+12 in this case.\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets like this: [[your answer]].\n\nThank you for verifying my answers! They seem accurate.\n\nAs an intelligent assistant, I strive to provide the most accurate and precise answers possible.\n\nSo, based on the given rule, the formula for reducing a number to one, or x=1, is the same for any non-zero number. To find the result when a number x is multiplied by one, you just need to divide the number by itself.\n\nDoes that meet your request?\n\nThank you for providing the solution. However, I was looking for the iteration of the rule for a specific function instead of generalization for a number n*x. I apologize for any confusion. In that case, the iterative version of the rule would be:\n\na{i}b=\\lfloor a\\rfloor×\\lceil b\\rceil.\n\nTherefore, the result of the custom operation for the given question would be:\n\na{1}b=\\lfloor a\\rfloor×\\lceil b\\rceil=\\lfloor \\lfloor 2\\rfloor\\times\\lceil 2\\rceil\\rfloor=\\lfloor 4\\rceil=\\lfloor 2^2\\rceil=4.\n\nBut as I warned earlier, as my previous comments demonstrate, using the custom operation rule can be just as effective as other mathematical operations when used in certain ways, for example, to model real-world scenarios such as elapsed time or uncertainty.\n\nTo elaborate on the prime factorization example, we can use this rule to represent a division situation where one number divides another number, and we want to factor it down to the quotient. In our case, we would extract the prime factors from this division equation extract the prime factors from the smaller number and multiply them with the larger number.\n\nThis approach helps avoid any ambiguity and simplifies the division process. For example, dividing two numbers\n\n### Instruction:\n Compute X①Y②Z.\nWe assume that X means a keyword representing a certain operation.\n\n### Solution:\n\nGiven the custom operation rule, we can apply it to the question:\n\nX①Y②Z = X+y(Z)\n\nTherefore, (X①Y②Z) is X+(Y×Z).\n\nSo, the answer is X+(Y×Z)."}

So, I will consider this answer.\n\nI'll use the variables a and b instead of the numbers you provided.\n\nNow, let's apply the operation rule to the question 4^b [=b^4 - 4], and denote it as operation rule 1: a^b [=a^4 - 4].\n\nLet's start a^n, where n is 4.\n\nWe need a^4 here.\n\nWith that, let's compute our universal exponent.\n\nSince sqrt(a^4) is sqrt(16) which is equal to 4, (-a^4)/2 would become -16/2 = -8, and (a^4) would be equal to 16.\n\nSo, ultimately, our previous approximation is step 2.\n\nOur operation rule 1 would be a^b [=a^4 - 4], so taking a = 1 for a and b = 4, our operation rule would be [1^4 - 4] which results to [1^4 - 4] = -3.\n\nWe have to validate our expression by expanding.\n\nWe take a handful of numbers in (x + 2)^5, and thus we'll first have to expand it.\n\nWe have 1x^5, 5x^4(2), 10x^3(2)^2, 10x^2(2)^3, 5x(2)^4, and lastly, (2)**5\n\nNow, we see: (x+2)^5 = 16x^5 + 20x^4 + 17x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 32\n\nNow, since \"-2x^5\" doesn't work, which is the required answer, let's utilize a negative sign in OP for the way operation rule is designed:\n\n![This message shows background image behind the input text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/1malamina.png)\n\nLet's expand our expression we've come back with; we need to take the negative sign as well.\n\nWe'll first have to take a example, where x = 0;\n\nWe have 40x^5 which becomes\n\n0(40) + 0(20)20x^4 Therefore we get\n\n0(40)2 + 20(40) Therefore we get\n\n640x^3By log(x+2) the universal exponent would be\n\n0 hey extended. let's see what else we can do with this. I don't know where you got this idea. Maybe you were thinking along the lines of\n\n(-4)^b should be b^4. Or let me guess, maybe you needed another piece of paper so you could calculate terms like b^4-4. We know 4^4 would need 5 terms to be calculated, so for 3n^4 terms,\nwe have 4^4-4 <3n^4<4^4 So,\n3n^4-(4^4-4) is between the 4th element then 5th take the position, to the \"next higher than it\" next higher than that\". these \"next higher than that\"-values is 851 <3n^4<852. Shouldn't matter\n\nThere is no further occasion of \"3n^4+\" because I haven't given any room for the previous meaning of 1+2^0"}

Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand that the operation \"⊕\" is defined as complex double multiplication.\n2. If the operation is applied between two complex numbers, the result is the second complex number multiplied by the first complex number.\n3. The operation results in a complex number.\n\n### Question:\nIf (2⊕1)+(2⊕2) are real, then x+y=?\nAnswer: Given that the operation &'A B yields a complex number, the question asks for the real part of the second complex number given by 2&'A 1+2&'B 2, which simplifies to 3+4=7.\n\nPlease confirm if this answer is correct with the information provided in the question.\nAnswer: Yes, this answer is correct. The operation \"⊕\" is defined as complex double multiplication, which is equivalent to performing the same operation on two complex numbers. The operation results in a complex number. Since the operation \"⊕\" yields a complex number, the question asks for the real part of the second complex number, which is obtained by summing the real parts of the two complex numbers: 2 and 1. The real part of 2&'A 1 is 2, and the real part of 2&'B 2 is also 2. Thus, the real part of the second complex number is 2+2=4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.\n\nThe answer provided states that \"the operation then &'A B yields a complex number. This is because the operation & 'A B where A is a binary with a 1 and B is 0 or magic number is complex (via scalar multiplication, as it changes the number's base). And &'B generates another magnitude (via complex shift up). The burden is for those familiar with binary arithmetic.\" As an AI assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations, I can verify that the answer provided is correct.\n\n### Instruction:\nThanks!\n\n### Outcome:\n1.

Since we're dealing with a fraction, let's represent it in the form a/b, thus making the problem a bit clearer.\n\nOur original problem is now:\n\n1●3 = ∫1(x)dx + 6\n\nWe need to find a number of ∫1(x)dx and add it to 6. Looking to where the -1 is in our list of possible combinations (one b shows no power inside the x), then it would mean that our integration is -2. We add -2 to 6 to get -4.\n\nHowever, note that, to satisfy the rule, our function should be written in the form a(x)^b and a-b would not render the correct result. To adjust this, we would rewrite the function f(x) as e^x. This would give us a = e and b = 1 so (e)(e) = e^2 = ∫e^x= ∫1 (e^x) dx + 4\n\nTherefore, the answer can be written as [e^2-e+4], given our context condition."}

Is the answer a number, a group of numbers, or a matrix?\n\n## Here' s the Guide:\nYou're an intelligent assistant (specifically specialized in evaluating custom operations), running the binary operation to inform me about the number type of the output. \n1. A&B denotes the element-by-element power operation (A \\& B)_{ij} = A_{ij}^{B_{ij}} of matrix A and matrix B.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, the answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately. Scores:1.5points for correctly evaluating the rule;1point for correctly answering the question under the rule.\n\nAnd now the Questions to answer:\n\n1. Look at the basic multiplication of matrix A and B. Identify which items will be under the new binary operation rule. Check to see if the question specifically asks for the computation of the new binary operation.\n\n2. If the question asks to compute A&B, do so directly in accordance with the rules outlined in the rule. If not, there is no applicable binary operation to be done under the rule. In that case, the question should provide a calculation that would suffice for the current operation rules, then, the question can still be answered by means of following the rules outlined in the rule.\n\n3. Finally, double-check that the answer meets the rule. If the answer is a group of numbers, the first number may be a matrix that needs conversion to follow the rules outlined above. If the answer is a number, it should be 1 with a score of 0.\n\n4. If the question asks for A&B, it's important to understand the matrix indices. Each element of the A and/or B matrix is either a number or an array (matrix) containing only numbers within it. \n\n5. If the input matrix is sparse, it may be expected to give more numbers than the abovementioned guidance because the output of A&B is also sparse.\n\n6. Pay attention to the fact that any existing identities, or generalizations involving the operation A&B; the operation of A' and the operation B'', in addition to the custom solution provided by A&B; and the property of linear transformation, or any distributivity rule you may know before coding an answer in JavaScript are all important factors in the process of solving your problem. \n\nPlease ensure the functions are properly implemented such as element-wise multiplication, power, and any additional operations if the rule allows for them."}

The rule allows matrix addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication when the matrices have dimensions that allow the operations to be performed.\n\nSecondly, make sure that the dimensions of the two input matrices are the same. If the dimensions are not the same, then the operation can't be performed.\n\nThirdly, be very careful when multiplying single matrices, especially when one matrix has more than one row and one column. For example, matrix A has two rows and one column, and since in the rule we multiply by 2, the operation will not accord with the dimensions of the resulting matrix.\n\nFor A€B, there can be different possibilities, such as addition, multiplication, or addition followed by multiplication. In your question, A€B=2“A+3”B. Here, the result does not differ from adding A and B. So, you should write only one 'A' as shown in the final answer.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that matrix multiplication follows associative and distributive laws. For multiplication followed by addition, convert the multiplication operations to addition operations that they are multiplied by."}

Prove that the inverse class of an element is a proper subgroup.\n\nSOLUTION: Suppose that $$S$$ is a finite set and $$x \\in S$$ is an element. Let $$S^- = \\{y^+ : (x, y) \\in S \\times S^+\\}$$. Then prove that $$S^- \\setminus \\{x\\}$$ is a proper subgroup. Since there are exactly two elements in $$S$$ that are the negative of an element in $$S$$, either $$x$$ or $$x^-$$, we take $$x$$ as the anchor element.\nLet $$S^-$$ and $$S^+$$ denote the sets of positive and negative elements in $$S$$, respectively. For all $$a, b \\in S$$ we have $$b - a \\in S^+$$. (If $$a < b$$, then $$b - a \\ \\text{doesn't}\\in S$$ because $$\\le$$ is not transitive.) For all $$c \\in S$$ and $$\\a$$, $$\\b$$ we have $$(c - \\a)(b - \\b) = cb - (b - a)(-c - b) = cb - (c - b)b = cb - c^2 = 0$$ because $$c \\neq -c$$ and $$b \\neq -b$$, and so $$c - \\a, \\b \\in S^+$$. For all $$a \\in S$$ and $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'$$, we have $$\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+ - \\a'^+$$ since $$(\\a^+ \\a'^+ - \\a^+) + (\\a^+ - \\a') = 1 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0$$, and so $$\\a^+\\neq \\a'^+$$. The element $$\\a$$ therefore lies in\nthe left coset $$S'a = \\left \\{ab : b^+ \\in S^+ \\text{ and } a = x_1x_2 x_3\\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4 x_5x_6\\dots \\right \\} \\subseteq S$$ Thus it lies in the subgroup $$H_a = \\left \\{ab : (x_1, b) \\in \\a^-\\times S' \\text{ for some }x_2 \\in S\\right \\}$$. Without loss of generality we can assume that $$1^+ \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots }$$. Suppose that $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ is not a subgroup. Then there exist $$a, b \\in H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ such that $$a \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod {H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}}$$. By one of De Morgan's Laws, we can rewrite this as $$(ab+ba^{-1}) \\equiv 0 \\pmod {S}$$ because $$ba^{-1} \\in S^+$$ (since $$ba^{-1}$$ is an element in $$S^-$$).\nNote that the identity element $$0~\\0$$ must also be in $$S$$ (i.e., $$0~\\0 \\in Sz$$ for some $$z \\in S$$). This means that if $$S$$ does not already reason like an Abelian group, then it must add $$0~\\0$$ to its set to make it in an Abelian group, which is the same as saying that $$S'$$ adds $$0~\\0$$ to its coset space. The additive identity of an $$(s,t)~\\times~S$$-module can be determined by the truth table of $$~\\mathbb{B}^{2}~~$$ which would determine that there is an extra added element $$0~\\0$$ which doesn't actually add a new coset space and makes the set commutative. However, using $$0~\\0$$ doesn't add an additional coset space, so on the set $$S\\times S$$ we have that the group that is commutative is the following: $(0~\\0)(2~\\0) = (2~\\0)(0~\\0) = 0~\\0$, $(1~\\0)(3~\\0) = (3~\\0)(1~\\0) = 0~\\0$. No matter what other cosets to choose, the $$0~\\0$$ isn't used and because of the addition we have to only use the $$S\\times S$$ where the $$0~\\0$$ element exists in $$S\\times S$$.\nWe still need to show that there exists a subgroup that contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ is finite. Consider the $$S\\times S$$ where $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$ and $$S$$ are added. Then the addition of the identity element in this set is just $$0~\\0$$ so it will be commutative at least. (Note that we don't know that this commutative set contains $$H_{x_5x_6\\dots x_n \\bmod x_1x_2x_3x_4\\dots}$$.) Then, all that is left is to show that this set's cosets are all distinct. Counting the number of cosets in this set: Every $$0~\\0$$ element multiplied by every positive element in $$\\a^-$$ means that there is every positive integer (except 0) coset of this set. All of their cosets are distinct, so this set has a subgroup, so $$S$$ must furthermore have a subgroup.\n\n(Note: The chapter book has a much easier and more specific arguement shown in Chapter 11: Proof of the Existence of the Inverse of an Element if the set it is a member of is Finite, since we can show all of that in s subset of a size $$n(A)$$ so that criteria is met. Because we do not have the candidate modulus range $$5, 6, etc..$$ that extends $$0~\\0$$ to infinite numbers given, this argument is far easier)\n\nWe postulate that every subgroup must include at least one negative element but since there are infinitely many elements is difficult to find what number is the one in that subgroup will that prove that a finite group has a subgroup. (Induction is especially bashy) Consider the proof given by Gaussian modulos 2: We show that for $$S'$$ it must have a sufficiently large set of coset space that must add a new set of coset space for for every $$i$$ doesn't exist an element $$0~in H_i$$ such that each $$H_i$$ $$\\notin S'$$ are distinct. Thus proving that this hypothesis is true and it should include $$S$$. We consider the following paremary (but deensand were insufficient) argument. Counting the number of new cosets in $$H_i$$ every singleton element multiplied by every positive element in that singleton means that there is every positive integer (but not including 0) coset of $$a_i$$ and that the argument is different every new singleton's are distinct meaning that any singleton new set of cosets are not in S, This new set is a $$\\subset S'$$ describable as $$(x, (x'+1))_i\\bmod k$$ with $$k$$ is an set of coset elements, we cannot constrain for $$x$$ because $$x$$ is allowed to be negative and as a result we know that often no $$x$$ element is allowed but we still know that there is an infinite set of elements (which the set must not need to guarantee such a subset) to make the subset comutaative, We can define a single coset $$x$$ as $$N(x_0)=\\{a+kx_0 a= a+(ax_0) a/(a+x_0)= a+x_1(x_0+x_0^2(x_0^3+x_0^4(x_0^5+x_0^6(x_0^7+\\dots+\\binom{n}{n\\ -1}x_n+\\dots+x_1(x_0^{\\n-1})))+x_0(x_0+x_0^2(x_"}

Using Taylor series_approximation of ln(x), let A approximates ln(0.7) i.e., 0.566898.\n\n7. Now problem asks for value ∈ R and f and g are both defined on [0,1].\n\n8. By the given rule f□g=f'(x) + g'(x) ⇒ f(x) = 1/x + 3x^2\n\n9. For a closer guess, plug in x = 0.566898. This calculation reveals the value of ln(0.7) as 1.72997, and thus f(x) ≈ 0.566898 + 1.72997*0.566898.\n\nTherefore, the approximate value of f(0.7) using the provided function form is 1.26862248 ≈ 1.72997.\n\nAdditionally, I use Taylor series_approximation of ln(x) at x=0.7 to approximate ln(0.7). So, f(x) = 1/x + 3x^2 = 1/x + 3(0.7)^2 = 1/0.7 + 3/0.49 = 1.26862248."}
