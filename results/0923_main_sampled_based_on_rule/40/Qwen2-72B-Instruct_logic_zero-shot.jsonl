Since each logical expression represents a combination of truth and falsehood of the statements made by A, B, and C, we can use the basic equivalences and truth table analyses to simplify these expressions.\n\nLet's start by simplifying each of the six expressions (B1&C2&D3, B1&C3&D2, B2&C1&D3, B2&C3&D1, B3&C1&D2, B3&C2&D1) individually and then combine these to simplify the final expression E.\n\n### Simplifications:\n\n(1) **B1&C2&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD3 = q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = (!p & q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (5) and (9), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & r\n```\n(2) **B1&C3&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC3 = !p & q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = (!p & q) & (!p & q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nUsing (4), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!p & q) & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\n```\nUsing (3) and (8), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & 1 & 1\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q\n```\n(3) **B2&C1&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC1 = p & !q\nD3 = q & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (p & !q) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (9) and simplifying with the Absorption Law (7), we find that (p&q)&(p&!q) = 0, which simplifies the expression to:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = ((!p & !q) | (0)) & (q & r)\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q) & (q & r)\n```\nFrom here, using (4) (q & r implying q is true), we get:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q & q) & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = !p & r\n```\n(4) **B2&C3&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC3 = !p & q\nD1 = !q & !r\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (!p & q) & (!q & !r))\n```\nWe can immediately simplify (!p & q) with (!p & q), giving us:\n```\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (!p & q & (!q | q) & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 simplifies to (!p & q & 1 & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 = !p & q & !r\n```\n(5) **B3&C1&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC1 = p & !q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q) & (p & !q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nFrom here, the (p & !q) terms simplify and disappear via (1) and (3), leaving us:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n```\nUsing the Distributive Law (5), we get:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & !q & r) | (p & !q & q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & r) | (0)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & r\n```\n(6) **B3&C2&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD1 = !q & !r\nB3 & C2 & D1 = ((p & !q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (!q & !r)))\n```\nSince (p & !q) contradicts (p & q), leaving only the expression relating to (!p & !q):\n```\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (!p & !q & !q & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (0 & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = 0\n```\n### Simplifying E:\n\nGiven the simplifications above, the final logical expression E can be simplified to:\n```\nE = (!p & q & r) | (!p & q) | (!p & r) | (!p & q & !r) | (p & !q & r) | 0\n```\nWe can eliminate the 0 term as it does not contribute to the value of the expression. Simplifying further, we get:\n```\nE = !p & (q & r) | q | r | (q & !r) | (p & !q & r)\n```\nAgain, noting that if q or r is true, their corresponding conjunctions are automatically included, we can further simplify this expression, eliminating redundant terms:\n```\nE = !p & (q | r) | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nGiven either q or r is true (since the problem states exactly one of p,q,r is true), and one of p or !p must be true, we know q | r = 1 within the context of this truth space. Let's further simplify:\n```\nE = !p & 1 | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nFinally, simplifying E down purely with our truth values:\n```\nE = !p | p & (r & !q) | q | r\nE = (1 | q | r) & [(!p | r) & (!p | !q)]\n```\nBut given 1 is the universal truth value, the final simplification (considering idempotence, domination, and Absorption Law) would lead to:\n```\nE = 1\n```\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n```\n[\n[B1&C2&D3::=::!p & q & r];\n[B1&C3&D2::=::!p & q];\n[B2&C1&D3::=::!p & r];\n[B2&C3&D1::=::!p & q & !r];\n[B3&C1&D2::=::p & !q & r];\n[B3&C2&D1::=::0];\n[E::=::1]\n]\n```"}

E1 simplified under the condition:\n\\[(!p&q&!r)\\]\n\n- In this part, we already have q (Shanghai) as true, which implies !p (not Suzhou) and !r (not Hangzhou) as true.

Therefore, Person C's statement is entirely incorrect.\n\n**Person B**: !q (Not Shanghai) is false and so p (Suzhou) is also false, which means p&!q is false. Therefore, Person B got everything wrong.\n\n**Clarification for half correctness**: Since there are only two options left for being half or entirely correct, and we have already labeled one person as entirely correct and the other as entirely incorrect.

In C1, we have literals \u00acp, \u00acq, and r. In C2, we have literals \u00acq, \u00acr, s, and \u00act.\n\nThe only literal pair that can be resolved (i.e., one literal and its complement) is \u00acr and r. However, these literals are not present together in one pair of clauses C1 and C2.\n\nSince resolving requires a literal and its complement to be available in two clauses and C1 does not contain \u00acr, and C2 does not contain r, we cannot resolve directly based on this rule.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a literal and its negation to resolve C1 and C2. In the definition given, resolution can be applied if there are simple disjunctive clauses of the form C1 = C3 \u2228 L and C2 = C4 \u2228 L\u2019. In this context, it seems there\u2019s confusion or an oversight. C1 and C2 do not directly contain a literal and its complement in the specified form for each other. But closely examining, we have:\n\nC1 = \u00acp \u2228 \u00acq \u2228 r (implying L = \u00acq in this context)\nC2 = \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr \u2228 s \u2228 \u00act (implying L\u2019 = q in this context, though q is not part of C2, it can be inferred that L\u2019 = \u00ac\u00acq = q)\n\nHowever, due to the definition constraints, literal L from C1 must have a complement L\u2019 in C2, which is not the case here since C2 does not contain q (complement of \u00acq from C1). Hence, by the rules provided, we should not proceed with resolution.\n\nSince we can't resolve the clauses C1 and C2 as per the given logic rule (there's no literal L that has its complement L' in other clause, apart from r and \u00acr which are not part of both clauses), we can logically infer that the dispel operation as defined, cannot be completed under this interpretation.\n\nAnswer: [C1 and C2 do not resolve according to given rule. Hence, dispel(C1, C2) cannot be determined as per the resolution algorithm.]\n\nThus, the answer as per rule and question can be expressed as: [[]], indicating an empty set of clauses or an indeterminate state under the provided logic rule since no valid dispel operation can be completed based on given clauses C1 and C2 under the direct resolution condition as currently defined."}

Entity set E = N (natural numbers).\n2. Replace entity constant a with its assignment a\u2032 = 0.\n3. Replace function symbol g with its implementation gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n4. Replace predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ(x, y) denoting x = y.\n\nThe provided formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, a), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing a with \\(a'\\) = 0, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing g with its implementation \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\), the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F((x * 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 gives 0 and because the implementation of predicate F(x, y) denotes \\(x = y\\), it becomes necessary to consider the semantics implied by these expressions. The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x \u2014 \\(F_J(0, x)\\) \u2014 only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x \u2014 this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]"}

Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\n\nThe resulting formula is denoted as \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3d, termed as the implementation of \ud835\udc35 under \ud835\udc3d.\n\n### Question:\n(a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n(b) a\u2032 = 2.\n(c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n(d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nWrite down the implementation of the following formulas under J:\n(1) \u2200x\u2200y\u2203zF(f(x,y),z)\n(2) \u2203xF(f(x,y),g(x,z)\n\nPlease provide the answer in [[];[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the provided rule and information, we will implement the two formulas under the interpretation \ud835\udc3d as requested.\n\n### Implementation of Formulas under Interpretation \ud835\udc3d:\nThe entity set \ud835\udc38: natural numbers \ud835\udc41.\nThe assignment of constants:\na\u2032 = 2.\nThe implementations of function symbols:\nf\ud835\udc3d(x, y) = x + y.\ng\ud835\udc3d(x, y) = x * y.\nThe implementation of the predicate symbol:\nF\ud835\udc3d(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\n### Formulas Under Interpretation \ud835\udc3d:\n\n(1) Formula: \u2200x\u2200y\u2203zF(f(x,y),z)\n   - The predicate symbol F is replaced with FJ, which denotes equality.\n   - The function symbol f is replaced with its implementation fJ, which adds the inputs.\n   - The resulting formula becomes: \u2200x\u2200y\u2203zFJ(fJ(x, y), z).\n   - Simplifying further, this becomes: \u2200x\u2200y\u2203z (fJ(x, y) = z).\n   - Substituting the implementation of fJ, it transforms into: \u2200x\u2200y\u2203z ((x + y) = z).\n   - This statement is true for the interpretation on natural numbers \ud835\udc41.\n\n(2) Formula: \u2203xF(f(x,y),g(x,z))\n   - Similar to the first formula, F is replaced with FJ, f with fJ and g with gJ.\n   - Therefore, it becomes: \u2203xFJ(fJ(x, y), gJ(x, z)).\n   - Substituting the implementations of fJ and gJ: \u2203xFJ((x + y), (x * z)).\n   - Since FJ denotes equality, it simplifies to: \u2203x ((x + y) = (x * z)).\n\nThus, for the given formulas under interpretation \ud835\udc3d, we have:\n\ud835\udc351\ud835\udc3d = [[];\u2200x\u2200y\u2203z ((x + y) = z)].\n\ud835\udc352\ud835\udc3d = [[];\u2203x ((x + y) = (x * z))].\n\n### Answer:\n[B1J = [[]; \u2200x\u2200y\u2203z(x + y = z)]; B2J = [[]; \u2203x(x + y = x * z)]]\n\nPlease note that the first part of [[] for each implementation is left empty as per the format provided, even though it doesn't add any information in this context."}

The doubt aspect from Alice is represented as \\(\\neg B_ip\\), which utilizes the negation of the belief (\\(\\neg B_p\\)) to indicate that Alice does not firmly believe in the proposition \\(p\\).\n\nThe consensus part, where \\(p\\) is a common belief in the group \\(G\\), is expressed as \\(G_p\\). Within this context, \\(G_p\\) stands for the fact that all members of the group, including Alice before her doubt began, collectively believe in \\(p\\). Note that while Alice's belief state regarding \\(p\\) has changed to doubt, we are specifically acknowledging the consensus notion that \\(p\\) was commonly believed irrespective of individual deviations.\n\nThus, the logical expression conveys the paradoxical or at least the anomalous situation in which Alice's current disbelief in \\(p\\) stands in contrast to the proposition being commonly believed in her group. The inclusion of both elements in the logical expression properly encapsulates the nuance of this specific scenario as defined within the Cognitive Logic framework."}
