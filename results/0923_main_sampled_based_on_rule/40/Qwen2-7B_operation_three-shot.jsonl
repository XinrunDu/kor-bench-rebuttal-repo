Here are the step-by-step responses to the task instructions, using Google Sheets style *text formatting*:\n\n### Task Instructions:\n#### Custom Operation Rule\n- The operation § means \"select the larger of the two numbers.\"\n- The operation $ means \"select the smaller of the two numbers.\"\n\n#### Question 1: (7§4) + (5$8)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the largest out of 7 and 4 is 7, and the smallest out of 5 and 8 is 5.\n- Therefore, (7§4) = 7 and (5$8) = 5.\n- Adding the two results gives (7§4) + (5$8) = 7 + 5 = 12.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(7&4) + (5$8)] = 12\n\n#### Question 2: (12$7) × (4§9)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the smallest out of 12 and 7 is 7, and the largest out of 4 and 9 is 9.\n- Therefore, (12$7) = 7 and (4§9) = 9.\n- Multiplying the two results gives (12$7) × (4§9) = 7 × 9 = 48.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(12$7) × (4§9)] = 48\n\n#### Question 3: If x§9 = 10, find x\n- By custom operation rule, the larger out of x and 9 is 10.\n- Therefore, x must be less than or equal to 10.\n- The answer can be expressed as x ≤ 10.\n\n#### Answer:\n>x ≤ 10\n\n#### Question 4: (2§8) − (5$1)\n- Using the custom operation rule, the largest out of 2 and 8 is 8, and the smallest out of 5 and 1 is 1.\n- Therefore, (2§8) = 8 and (5$1) = 1.\n- Subtracting the second result from the first gives (2§8) − (5$1) = 8 − 1 = 7.\n\n#### Answer:\n>[(2§8) − (5$1)] = 7"}

To evaluate (3⊕4) and (7⊕2), we substitute these values into our operation rule, a⊕b=a+bi, so (3⊕4)=3+i4=3+4i and (7⊕2)=7+2i=7+2i. Then, (3⊕4)+(7⊕2)((3+4i)+(7+2i)), which equals 10+6i. Therefore, [[10+6i]].\n\n2. Again, we substitute (5⊕6)=5+6i and (3⊕1)=3+i into our operation rule. To compute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1), we first calculate 5*3=15 and 6*i*1*i=-6, so (5⊕6)×(3⊕1)=15+-6i=15-6i.\n\n3. We substitute (5⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. In this case, (5⊕3)=5+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (5⊕3)+(X⊕2)×3=11+11i, we first cancel out the X value, as X can vary. So we are left with (5⊕3)+(2i)×3=(5⊕3+a)×1=(5+ai)×1=11+11i. As (5⊕3)=5+3i, we subtract this from 11+11i, resulting in 11+11i-(5+3i)=6+8i. So, 6+3i (11+11i-(5+3i)) = a×1=6+8i. Hence, a=X=2.\n\n4. This is similar to the second question, so we substitute (6⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. Then, (6⊕3)=6+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (6⊕3)+(X⊕2)×2=10+11i, we first cancel out the X value: (6⊕3)+(2i)×2=(6⊕3+a)×1=(6+ai)×1=10+11i. By subtracting (6⊕3)=6+3i from 10+11i, we have 10+11i-(6+3i)=4+8i. So, 4+2i(10+11i-(6+3i)) = a×1=4+8i. Consequently, a=X=4."}

This can be expressed as:\n\na●b=∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx + 6\n\nThis operation essentially adds 6 after integrating a function f(x) over the specified interval.\n\n[1] Question: Given f(x)=x^2, compute 1●3.\n\nTo compute 1●3 when f(x)=x², we integrate x² over the interval [1,3] and then add 6.\n\n∫₁³ ℎ² dx = [x³/3]₁^³ = (27/3) - (1/3) = 26/3\n1●3 = (26/3) + 6 = (26+18)/3 = 44/3.\n\n[2] Question: Given f(x)=e^x, compute 1●2.\n\nSimilarly, for f(x)=e^x, we compute ∫₁² e^x dx + 6.\n\n∫₁² ℎ')}}\"></img>\n1●2 = e² - e + 6.\n\n[3] Yes, there is more than one option for the value of a which can satisfy the condition that a●3 = 44/3 when f(x)=x²:\n\nGiven a●3 = 44/3, we determine the value of a such that ∫ₐ³ x² dx = 44/3 - 6 = 22/3.\n\n[x³/3]ₐ³ = 22/3\n(27/3) - (a³/3) = 22/3\na³ = 9\na = 3^(1/3).\n\nWhile this is the specific solution, any positive number when cubed is also 3^(1/3), so the answer can be expressed as: a = 1^³ or a = 2^³ or a = (n^3)^(1/3) where n is a positive integer.\n\n[4] Question: Given f(x)=sin(x), compute 0●π.\n\nIntegrating sin(x) from 0 to π gives -cos(0) + cos(π) = 0. Thus, 0●π = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\n[5] Question: Given f(x)=cos(x), compute 0●π.\n\nIntegrating cos(π) from 0 to π respects the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n\n[-sin(π)]₀ = [-sin(0)] = 0\n\nSo, 0●π = 0 + 6 = 6."}

The key difference is that xxxxx share switching essentially leads to a xxxxx transaction on xxxxx. Instead of xxxxx, they simply send the shares xxxxx, while x xxxxx xxxxx are really tracking the share xxxxx. If you were xxxxx facilitate your trade xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx, you'll xxxxx your xxxxx to be xxxxx, instead of completing a xxxxx. Also, however, xxxxxx will take xxxxx you xxxxxx to get the xxxxxxxx so it'll x xxxxx it xx quite xxxxx.\n\nAdditionally, in a xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx, you xxxxx an xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxx, and xxxxx bring your xxxxx xxxxx will xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx. This is not xxxxx xxxxx existing xxxxxxxx exactly, xxxxxx you xx a xxxxx xxxxxxxx who xxxxx xxxxx and xxxxxxxxx them xxxxx xxxx are xxxxxxxx.\n\nYou xxxxx the reddit, the user TBBG1213 provided a working solution for their issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amiibo/comments/fq8yow/amiibo_centers_buying_selling_trading_postspacehack/FxZUxtd  \n\nThey were able to do this by x creating a xxxxx xx verts and xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx behind the xxxxx. This way, the xxxxx could move along the x x which xxxxx the x-vert xx xx form, x then it xx go xxxxxx a continuous x number of xxxxxx polygons until it loops back x.\n\nIf the above doesn't help solve your problem, xxxxxx we can xx able xx xxxxx xx xxxxxxxx an xxxxxxxx problem and xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx help.\n\nI hope this helps explain the different aspects of share switching and how xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx happen.
