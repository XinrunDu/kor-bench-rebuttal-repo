The game is played on a square grid of letters.\n2. The player is given a set of words to find on the grid.\n3. The words can be arranged horizontally, vertically, diagonally, backwards, or staggered.\n4. Find all hidden words and label their start and end points.\n\nWe can observe the grid and word list and apply:\n\n1. Identify directions the words can go: \n   - horizontally\n   - vertically\n   - diagonally\n   - backwards\n   - staggered\n\n2. Check each direction and combination of directions for each word to see if it fits in the grid, next to existing parts of the word or diacritics.\n\n3. If a word matches the grid, note the starting and ending points.\n\n4. Repeat this process for all the words.\n\n5. The final task is to present the start and end points in the requested format.\n\nFor example, if the word \"POTATO\" were on the grid, starting at grid (9,9) and ending in grid (10,10), it would have the answer form POTATO (9,9)(10,10).\n\nFollowing these steps for each word from the given list using the grid provided, we can come up with the desired solution."}

Use line breaks between answers of different words and wrap the answer in double square brackets.\ne.g.\nSuppose the word list is BACH MOZART BRAHMS\nThe answer should be:\n[[BACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2)\nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)]]\nThis puzzle rule seems simple and straightforward: the user is asked to solve a puzzle where words can be arranged in different directions on a grid of letters, and they are required to find and label all the hidden words. Here's how this rule can be applied:\n\n1. In line with the puzzle rule, understand that the player will be given a grid of letters and a word list to find on the grid. The puzzle won't have any predefined solutions or expected end-points; the player must discover and label them.\n\n2. Apply this rule to any unseen puzzle of this nature. The words must be arranged in unique fashion across various directions and patterns. The most important aspect of this puzzle is to accept the deviation or alteration beyond the standard horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction, which includes backwards or staggered directions.\n\n3. Similarly, for your question:\n\nYou are to find hidden words on a grid of letters according to the following format. All words in the grid can be arranged horizontally, vertically, diagonally, backwards, or staggered. Find all hidden words, then label them. The answer should be in the format (row i, column j), e.g., (12,4)(12,1) indicates the start and end points of the word start at row 12, column 4 and end at row 12, column 1. Ensure your answers follow the provided word list. For every solution, use a line break to separate words. Double square brackets should enclose the entire answer.\n\nLet's apply this to a concrete example: \n\nLet's assume a grid given to you is:\n```\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n```\nAnd the word list is: HOME PRINT PENS\n\nYou would use the rule as follows to find and mark the words in the appropriate format:\nFirst, find the word 'HOME', using vertical orientation first: (1,1) to (1,3). Checking diagonally: check both the upwards and downwards diagonals, but in this case, you won't find any match. \n\nThe word 'PRINT' uses the horizontal orientation: (2,1) to (2,5) (though in this example, there is no 'T' in the grid, so you would end where possible). \n\nFinally, for the word 'PENS' using vertical orientation: (1,4) to (1,6) (again, though there is no 'N' in the grid, you reach the grid border where no more letters are present).\n\nYou'd then compile your answers to look like this:\n[HOME (1,1)(1,3)\nPRINT (2,1)(2,5)\nPENS (1,4)(1,6)]"}

This means you can have as few or as many black tiles as required to fulfill the given conditions. \n\nWe are also given the positions within the column and row where the black tiles' weights are (1 - n and 1 - n respectively). \n\nTherefore, without a specific rule about filling up the grid, you are unable to solve this puzzle because there are multiple ways to fulfill the given constraints, with different combinations of black tiles.\n\nIf you could provide a rule for how many cells should be filled or some kind of limitation, then, you can apply the puzzle rule and find a suitable answer."}

The numbers can be arranged horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. We can use a backtracking algorithm to solve this puzzle.\n\nThe backtracking algorithm works as follows:\n1. Start from the first empty cell in the grid.\n2. Try to fill in the empty cell with a number from 1 to 81 that has not appeared in the same row or column.\n3. If such a number exists, go to the next empty cell and repeat step 2.\n4. If no number can be filled in the current cell, go back to the previous cell and try a different number.\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all the cells are filled.\n\nHere is the solution to the given puzzle using the backtracking algorithm:\n\n[[9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17,55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63,64 80 81 79 78 77 76 75 74,65 70 71 72 73 49 38 27 26,66 67 68 74 75 76 77 69 60,\n   28 22 41 39 37 35 34 30 29,61 40 24 31 11 12 13 32 33,51 52 53 54 47 48 49 42 43]]\n\nHere are step by step instructions for solving the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm:\n\n1. Start from the first empty cell in the grid. In the given puzzle, the first empty cell is X in the sixth row and second column.\n\n2. Try to fill in the empty cell with a number from 1 to 81 that has not appeared in the same row or column. We can try to fill in the cell with the number 9, as it has not appeared in the same row or column.\n\n3. If such a number exists, go to the next empty cell and repeat step 2. After filling in the cell with 9, the next empty cell is X in the seventh row and first column. We can try to fill in the cell with the number 1, as it has not appeared in the same row or column.\n\n4. If no number can be filled in the current cell, go back to the previous cell and try a different number. After trying to fill in the last empty cell with different numbers, we find that the number 42 is the only number that can be filled in the empty cell in the ninth row and fourth column.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all the cells are filled. After filling in all the cells using the backtracking algorithm, we get the puzzle solution.\n\nThe backtracking algorithm is a widely used technique for solving puzzles like Sudoku, as it can efficiently find the solution by trying out all possible options and backtracking when necessary."}

To fix this, we can change the code to keep track of the answer and then print the answer when the `periscope` list is the same as the initial `zeroed` list. Here is the modified code:\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\nperiscope = [list(input().split(' ')) for _ in range(n)]\nzeroed = [ p[:] for p in periscope]\nanswer = []\nwhile(True) :\n    periscope = getNextLayer()\n\n    if periscope == zeroed :\n        for p in periscope :\n            answer.append(transform(p))\n        break\n\nfor a in answer:\n    print('[',a,']')\n```\n\nThis code changes the code block that calculates `periscope` to return the list which represents the current situation on the board. If `periscope` is the same as `zeroed` it means that we finished our calculation and we can start building the answer.\nWhen we get to this point, we iterate over `periscope` and call the `transform` function for each entry. The result is stored in an `answer` list. At this point, we can exit the while loop because we are done calculating the answer, and we can print out the answer, element by element.\nThe `transform` function is the same as in the original code.\n\n`zeroed` is a list composed of the same elements as `periscope`, but starting with an empty string instead of `X`. This allows us to track the evolution of `periscope` and compare it to `zeroed`.

Let's break down the rule:\n\n1. The grid consists of several partitions (zones) with a number of squares each.\n2. A fixed number of \"n\" stars must fill each row and column.\n3. Also, each partition requires \"n\" stars to be placed within it, such stars cannot be adjacent to each other (including diagonally).\n4. The final output should arrange the coordinates region-wise, in an alphabetical order. If one region has multiple star coordinates, sort them by the least number of rows and then least number of columns. Separate each region with a line breaker.\n\n## Part 2: Solving the Puzzle with the given question\nThe question provided to solve is:\n\n### Question:\n1 star.\n\nGiven game rules apply for this puzzle.\n\n### Solve\nSimilar to our previous answer, we notice the addition of the rule that 'n' stars should fill the grid. This results in a total of n x (rows + columns) stars (bingo stars). As per our question, this results in 1 star being required to be placed, according to the rules, the answer should be none.\n\n### Answer:\nNone. \nSince there is only one star requirement, the region would be one entire grid without any stars. Hence, there is no need to sort or filter anything as there isn't anything to be sorted."}

The question clearly indicates that the maze is specified by the arrangement of arrows in grid cells, and that the task is to find the inflection points (places where the direction of the arrow changes) in order. I understand that the direction of the arrow is clockwise and changes every 6 grids.  \n\nThe output for each question is a list of numbers separated by spaces, with the digits representing the position of each inflection point. To solve this task, I applied the specified rule and identified the moving direction by comparing the arrow direction at a location with the one in the previous location. If the directions didn't match or if we got back to the starting position, I considered that as an inflection point and saved its position.\n\nLet's consider one of your questions:\n\n### Question:\n↙        ↓        ↑  \n↗       傝         ↙\n↘         ↗         →\nI considered the blanks as indicating no change in direction. So the direction of the first arrow is `words-words`. Then, the direction of the second arrow is `中美-不`, which points down, but words以下 otherwise indicate that we have to go to the right. Therefore, a change in direction has occured, an inflection point has been found at grid position (1,0).\n\nContinuing like this I computed the positions of the inflection points. The positions are (0,2), (0,4), (2,3), (3,0). The coordinates are given in respect of the top left corner of the grid, starting from 0 and beginning with the row above the first row. \n\nTherefore, following the rule I identified the inflection points and saved their positions according to the rules you provided. Please note that you might slightly adjust the rules to fit your needs but this should give you a starting point."}
