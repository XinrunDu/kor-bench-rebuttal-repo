For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z]]\n\nTo solve the given cipher, we need to apply the specified encryption and decryption steps as per the provided instructions. Here's the solution:\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n1. For each lowercase letter `p` in `plaintext`:\n   - If `p` is an uppercase letter (A-Z), calculate an index from 2 to `key_index + 1` using the ASCII values of uppercase letters minus the ASCII values of `p`.\n   - Convert this index to an 8-bit binary string and shift it to the left to calculate `2^p`.\n2. Convert every pair of characters (ASCII values) from `p` to `k` to uppercase.\n3. Add the transformed characters.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. For each uppercase letter `p` in `ciphertext`:\n   - Calculate the index of `p` from the Automaton Table.\n   - Reverse it by shifting the result to the right once.\n   - Use the ASCII value of the resulting index to get the original character.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given examples:\n\n**Scenario 1: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"K\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"K\":\n  - `p` is 'K' (ASCII: 110)\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, calculate index: (110 - 97) = 2\n  - p is not a lowercase letter, convert to uppercase: 'K'\n  - Add k to the result: 110 + 111 = 1110\n- Step 2: Calculate index by shifting index 2 to the left: index value remains index 5\n- Step 3: Convert index to characters: 'K'\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nK\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"3^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"3^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, convert to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 2 to the result: 1110 + 202 = 812\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n81\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"6^13^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"6^13^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is not an uppercase letter even though it is in uppercase letters.\n  - Calculate index: 88\n  - Shift the index to the right once: new index is 13\n  - Convert back to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 13 to the result: 88 + 131 = 219\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[10^2]\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter is encrypted to '7':\n  - Calculate the digit 7 in base 10 (7/10 = 0 remainder 7): 07\n\nNow, output the encrypted string: [[[07]]]\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[[07]]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 5: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^13^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^13^1\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` + 1 = 176 (not 7:8)\n  - Calculate `2^13` + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNumber of characters to rotate left: 7 - 1 + 1 = 7\nRotated integer: `999 <= index <= 1010`\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[7]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 6: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Decryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024 (not 7:8)\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter the encrypted string `[7]` corresponds to (eleven):\n  - Since the index `p` is `7`, it maps to `[7]`, and indexing from 0 up to `key_length - 1` is `0 - 7 + 1 = -6 + 1 = 10^10 - (1 - 7 + 1) = 10^10 - 3`\n\nNow, output the string based on the mapping:\n```\n[['[7]']]\n```\n\nLet's write the corresponding Python code to verify these steps:\n```python\ndef encrypt(input_string, key):\n    ciphertext = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') -

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The accuracy and reliability of the model should be assessed on a variety of datasets as well, and it should be regularly updated and monitored to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in the long-term.\n\n### Exploiters can use various techniques to discover weaknesses in a system, but the first step is to gather as much information as possible about potential vulnerabilities. One possible cybersecurity expert service provides an assessment of the system's capacity to protect users and the organizations that use them. It gives insights into what kind of vulnerability exists and provides recommendations on what can be done to address it in a controlled manner.\n \n### Check for vulnerabilities:\n\nThe security expert will start by performing security assessments focusing on any security gaps or weaknesses within the system before determining if such vulnerabilities exist. For example, if there is a problem with the system's encryption algorithms, the security expert may provide information on how to replace the algorithms with better ones.\n\n### Security Assessments\n\nThere are numerous different ways to assess the health of a system. Throughout the course of the process, the security expert may examine logs and logs, and will use various software testing and scripts.\n\n### Automating Int\nThe exam internalizes various elements. They consist of the act of doing die first, finishing off for the final stage. The first activity may also encompass elaboration about technical and unbiased domains.\n\n3. Automating Inner Work. The second aspect entails the elaboration about the intricate communication of terminology. It is essential to contextualize the linguistic surrounding of the moment in the perspective of extensive abstractions.\n\n4. Technical Monitoring. The final activity touches upon the details of the technical specifications, including software basics, interfaces, and network setups. The subsequent objective might include the elaboration on how these aspects impact a specific control system level.\n\n**(D)** To further entitle not only electrons, but also those memes, exponential functional amplitudes, left innovative moles, exotic compact multi-dimensional symmetries and tetrads, and Nonsymmorphic multiparticular associations, $I$hsot4est virtuening suqculvity witnes be uht coloneereal yturrargions, gunner.writinitlets.errors while exploring.

If the single row encryption method is used, calculate the total number of rows (R) and column counts (C).\n3. If the column-by-column encryption method is used, calculate the total number of columns (C) and rows (R).\n4. Identify the repeated letter key used in each column or row combination.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[M]]\n\nTo perform an encryption or decryption of the given ciphertext (\"PFS\") using the Masterpiece Cipher (or \"11”, as a shorthand), we'll analyze the provided formula:\n\nUser Input:\n- Plaintext (P): \"PFS\"\n- Key (K): \"11\"\n\nFirst, we should identify the relation between \"P\" (plaintext) and \"K\" (how to encrypt or decrypt). However, unless there's a clear relation, there isn't a direct encryption or decryption for multiple letters like \"E\" and \"I\". \n\nBut let's leap into decryption.\n\n### Processing Code:\n\n**Encryption Phase:**\n\n1. **Input:** (6, 6) (As described in Step 1 of the rules)\n2. **Rows and columns:** 6 continuous row and 6 continuous column (Just 6, which is good enough for arbitrary string input). Let's call it `matrix`.\n3. **Encryption Feedback:** (A, 2) (Remember, their comparison is just to determine if the encryption output is A, otherwise B if it's then decryption with the correct alpha to dictionary).\n   - \"X\" is α (something representative for the letter A), so α has lower right cursor position (M to T). Since X has 1 in its higher right cell (3rd row & 3rd column), we have A'S lower right cursor (directory Q) wherever corresponding spread symbol letter V is located.\n   - \"G\" is β (Someone known word), so β has higher right cursor (Z to D). Since G in its lower right cell (2nd row & 2nd column) for its spread symbol letter U, we have D'S lower right cursor (vertical L). At similar, multiply, and multiply upward (G over U) as T, we get DG!\n\n**Encrypted Character Set:** CBGZW\n\nNow, we decrypt with the \"11\" constant:\n1. **Lower Left Cursor:** T (as completely under the letter with coordinates of Q).\n2. **Lower Right Cursor:** DG (Right Word).  \"G\" has lower right cursor for Q.\n3. **Up Direction (for \"I\"):**\n   - Character V in any lower right horizontal position means the cell should be eaten. That's why the letter is M. The splitter `M ~ ~ B ~ F ~ T` matches to the setup on the 6x6 matrix.\n4. **Upper & Full Right Cursor:** CDWN (this is skipped, since it's not well know.)\n\nThus, it's our output, yn from the ordered alphabet that goes to \"18\".\n\nThe format followed:\n~~~Base-6 Output {private Code DS = 18 ,Iifferential Code NIC is Decade}~~\nThus:\n1 - deriving = \nMicrosoft VBScript, JIT Compiler v16.1.0.0, MS Excel, Silverlight v2, ODBC v6.75.15076.0, Zune<Product Version=15.10.5 [32x64]]  \n\nTo input\n\nPrisspqrstuvwxyz,   3 bytes (pris = pure EAV)\n\nOur output:\n\n\"For part 1 use Microsoft's ID class interface\nXAX MXMX RXMX \"\n\n(Note emojis)\nOutput:\n\n![Encryption Function](https://i.imgur.com/HvW5HKS.jpg)\n\nDecryption Function:\n\n 输出:\n\n![Encryption Function](https://i.imgur.com/HvW5HKS.jpg)\n\nThus: 2202024?2002\n \nPlease let me know if you need anything else!

This includes writing $-3^0$ as $3^0$ and $-3^n$ for $n = 0$.\n\n### Question:\nFind all positive integers $n$ such that $n + 4n^2 = 10r^2$ for some integer $r$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe known solution for this problem is that all positive integers $n$ satisfy the relationship. This is because if $n$ were a negative integer, then there would be nothing to divide by $4n^2$ in forms that are multiples of $10r^2$, and such negative numbers would not be added to the right side of the equation.\n\n### Question:\nFind the remainder when 71 is divided by 24.\n\n### Answer:\nThe remainder of 71 divided by 24 is 21, as follows: $$71 \\div 24 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 5 \\text{, so } 71 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{24}$$.\n\n### Question:\nHow many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5?\n\n### Answer:\nTo determine how many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5, we need to consider the units digit of a perfect square. The units digit of a perfect square property to be a particular number, the unit digits of the multiple, partition of the number must mirror. If the minimal multiple consists of digits hitting $a$, the alternative partition of the number must take up brackets similar to $a$.\n\nThis problem is repeated tensorization of the units digit 5, the method utilizes the following properties and rules: \n1. Regroupers of minimum prevalent 5 up to the ones upstabilrment.\n2. Simple multiplication principle in units remaning digit.\n\n\\(N = 110 \\times121 \\times 130 \\times 140 \\times 150 \\times 160 \\times 170 \\times 180 \\times...\n\\)\n\n## Python program\n```\ndef compute():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter Max number -> \"))\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        j = i\n        while j * j <= n:\n            count += n // (j * j)\n            j += 1\n        if i * i == n:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\ncompute()\n```\n\nThe program demonstrates the logic to find the no. of perfect square like numbers with a units digit of 5 i.e, via recursion."}

One mathematical method could be RSA. Such a system uses the modulus to store an individual key, namely the encryption and decryption keys. We can associate a modulus with the password and encryption/decryption has a proportion of 24 to 36. This password is now encoded and made redundant, in comparison to the RSA system. The flow of sand can be described as encryption, hash and decryption.
