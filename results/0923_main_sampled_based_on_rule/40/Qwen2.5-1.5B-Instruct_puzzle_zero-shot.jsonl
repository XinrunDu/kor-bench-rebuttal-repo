However, this specific rule needs to be applied to the puzzle itself to get an accurate answer. The puzzle is: TO+GO=OUT.\n\nFirst, we need to assign a unique number to each letter from the words \"TO+GO=OUT\":\n- T = 1\n- O = 0\n- G = 5 (since 15 + 35 = 50)\n- E = 8\n- S = 9\n- N = 7 (since 98 - 35 = 63)\n- I = 3\n- V = 4\n\nNow we substitute these numbers into the equation \"TO+GO=OUT\":\n- T = 1\n- O = 0\n- G = 5\n- O = 0\n- E = 8\n- S = 9\n- N = 7\n- I = 3\n- V = 4\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n[[TO+GO=OUT]] = [[15+5=74]]\n\nTherefore, the answer in the form requested is:\n[[TO+GO=OUT]] = [[15+5=74]]"}

The initial grid looks like:\n   ```\n   X  2  X  4  23\n   9  X  X  11  24\n   X  12  X  8  31\n   21  15  19  23\n   ```\n\n2. We need to fill in the remaining blanks while ensuring the sum of each row and column matches the given numbers at the end.\n\n3. Let's start with the second row:\n   - The third element of the second row is an X. Since the sum of the second row should be 43 (24 + 9 + X), we need to solve for X:\n     \\[ 9 + X + 8 = 43 \\]\n     \\[ X + 17 = 43 \\]\n     \\[ X = 26 \\]\n     So, we fill in the third element with X = 26, making the second line be `2  26  26  11  24`.\n\n4. Moving to the third row:\n   - The third element here is 12, so the sum of the third row should be 61 (31 + 8 + 26):\n     \\[ 26 + 12 + 19 = 61 \\]\n     \\[ 19 = 61 \\]\n     This confirms our number for the third row.\n\n5. Now, considering the first row:\n   - The fourth element is 23. The sum of the first row should be 72 (2 + 4 + 11 + 23):\n     \\[ 2 + 4 + 11 + X = 72 \\]\n     \\[ 17 + X = 72 \\]\n     \\[ X = 55 \\]\n     We can't fill in the fourth element since we don't have enough valid numbers for this row.\n\n6. Finally, the last row, the fourth:\n   - The fourth element here is 23. The sum of the fourth row should be 83 (15 + 19 + 26 + 7):\n     \\[ 15 + 19 + 26 + 19 = 83 \\]\n     \\[ 83 = 83 \\]\n     This confirms our number for the elements in this row, leaving 21 to be filled.\n\nGiven that we have some issues with the fourth row, we need to re-evaluate the way to fill in the puzzle:\n\nStarting from the last row, we have:\n- 21 at the first column, we know it must match the supplement of the other required numbers. (The fourth row requires summing up to 72 and filling in the numbers corresponding to each blank.)\n- Making from the first row:\n  - 2 + 23 = 25\n  - This can only progress if the numbers are (Apart from 9 and 2 because, X cancel each other)\n  - Thus, we fill in “2 + 11 + 26 + 2” as each category.\n  \n  Indeed, Why the mentioned you sqrtm can be fixed?\n  \n  The number is summarized.\n  - Since the paths overlap, 12345.
