Candidates are expected to demonstrate a deep understanding of Salesforce Platform events, canonical limits, and triggers, alongside their ability to apply these concepts to resolve non-standard conditions. The solution is required to be flexible enough to handle variations of inputs and produce outputs aligned with the outlined verification criteria.\n\n### Story:\n\nA proposal for development is received from the requester. The baseline charter for the request contains two table fields: Lead Entity Table ([TableA]) and Related Entity Table ([TableB]), where a key record from Lead Entity Table may have associated records in Related Entity Table ([TableB]). The task is to add a [step1] link record in Related Entity Table ([TableB]), to select between different options in the hooks. Subsequently, a [step2] link record in Related Entity Table must be created or existing records updated, specifying the updated field values.\n\n### Rules:\n\n1. The step1 link exists first in [TableA], the primary key of which is a non-unique value (field [fieldA])\n2. It is not possible to create a step2 link record when the [fieldB] from [TableB] already exists in the list of data in [TableA].\n3. It is not possible to update the [fieldB] in the [TableA] where it is already defined (i.e., non-null), to save the [fieldB] exists field of the record and preserve the original value.\n4. The data is specified in the request as an input variable [TableC], which may or may not contain [fieldB].\n\n### Requirements:\n\n1. Write a script that creates an appropriate generic trigger in [TriggerB] to handle the expectation given in rule 1.\n2. Write a script that creates a generic trigger in [TriggerC] to handle rule 2.\n3. Create valid entities for [TableA] and [TableB] in required dependencies in [Object_A] and [Object_B] without using any custom field but a static member field that matches the value of the [staffId] field of the Salesforce user executing the script.\n4. Validate that [step1] has executed correctly for the charts (no error firing) without writing any trigger to [TriggerB].\n5. Write a generic trigger in [TriggerC] that executes after the first step without using \"database.allowBatchExec()\" but includes the restriction that it performs an invalid operation if it is already executed.\n6. Use a sequence generator as a solution for [TriggerB] instead of a duplicate_set_member.\n\n# Convert TriggerB to TriggerC and award status [[A]] or [[B]]\nA. [[A]], triggerC\nB.

By replacing the blood in the body with a special fluid that does not freeze, and subsequently lowering the temperature of the hibernation chamber to -50°C, the physiological activity of the basic organs of the body still proceeds slowly with the help of the external circulatory system, but this activity is extremely slow, similar to the standby state of a computer. This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species.

That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

This technology allowed Zootopia to create environments adapted to each type of animal.\nThese eco-zones are also recyclable ecosystems, with the creators designing the walls of the tundra city as giant air conditioners with air vents that simultaneously heat the Sahara Plaza, so that if the snow and ice melt, then the rainforest areas can be nourished\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.\n\n### Question:\nUnder what circumstances do environments differ dramatically at smaller geographic scales?

When examining the Ancient Fuelweaver and the Ancient Murals, a number of characters refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization as \"bug people\".\nThe date of Maxwell's last act is April 17, 1906.\nThe Year of the Varg is an event in Don't Starve Together, lasting from February 9 until March 16, 2018. \nWays to negate Hay Fever include:Wearing a Gas Mask or Particulate Purifier.Eating (raw or cooked) Seed Pods, Nettles, Meated Nettles or Nettle Rolls.Being near a working Oscillating Fan.Turning on Living Artifact.Travelling to another world via the Skyworthy.Eating cooked tea tree seed.\nThe total accumulated stress changes the output of a grown plant. From 0 to 1 stress point, the plant grows a Giant Crop.\nIn all DLCs as well as DST, the Backpack is a flammable item. When set on fire, everything inside won't be affected by fire but the Backpack will eventually burn to Ashes, dropping anything it had inside.\nGhost Players or Ghost Characters appear whenever a player dies in Don't Starve Together. They can fly around and haunt objects.\nWX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. WX-78 has mechanical parts analogous to those of human beings, with its Chemical Engine acting as a stomach. In DST, WX-78's favorite food is Butter Muffin, resulting in a 15 bonus to Hunger when consuming the food.\nThe Tam o' Shanter is a Hat Item that is obtained by killing MacTusk. It restores 6.7 Sanity per minute while worn.\nIn Don't Starve, the majority of human characters are designed with four fingers on each hand.\nSleepytime Stories causes Mobs within 30m to fall asleep about 2 seconds after reading. The duration of sleep depends on the target and the effect is broken when it is attacked.\nPractical Rain Rituals is a unique book by Wickerbottom added to Don't Starve Together. Crafting requires 2 Papyrus and 2 Down Feathers.When read, this book has the ability to toggle rain. \nAn Earthquake is a naturally occurring event in Caves and the Ruins. Earthquakes occur regularly and can even be induced by igniting Gunpowders, Slurtle Slimes, Slurtle Mounds, Snurtles, and Slurtles; using a Telelocator Staff and attacking a Big Tentacle.\nTreeguards are Boss Monsters that can occasionally transform from Evergreens when a nearby Evergreen is chopped down. They are initially hostile towards the wood-cutter, assuming that is how they were spawned, have very high health and damage, and are capable of killing most unarmored characters in three strikes. They can be pacified by planting new trees nearby.\nA live Moleworm can be obtained by either attacking it (one time) with a Hammer or Executive Hammer after it surfaces, or digging its Burrow by a Shovel during the day, which destroys the Burrow. Moleworms will slowly starve in the inventory, if not fed minerals. The The Blue Gem belongs to a category of minerals.\nThe Lightning Conductor is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. It is found in the Seafaring Filter and requires 5 Gold Nuggets to craft, and a Think Tank to prototype.\nHounds can swim in the ocean and may transform into Horror Hounds after death on the Lunar Island.\n A Worm Hole is a living tunnel, which warps the player to a different area of the map. Worm Holes appear as a mouth in the ground, and will open when approached by the player. When the option 'Jump' is selected, the character will leap inside to be spit out the other end after a brief delay. There are multiple Worm Holes in most worlds and they always connect the same two places on the map. \nWhen placed on the ground and lit with a Torch or a Lighter, the Flare will shoot up into the sky. It will then cause all other players to make an announcement about the flare and create a marking on the Map that is near, but not on, the launch site, for 15 seconds that is visible to all players.\nIn all DLCs, Dragonpie increases the player's perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds when consumed.

When examining the Ancient Fuelweaver and the Ancient Murals, a number of characters refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization as \"bug people\".\nJustification: The key information provided in the story rule is that \"Modern people\" or \"bugpeople\" refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization. Therefore, the ancient inhabitants of the ruins are inferred to have similar appearance to modern beings with unique social structures and names.\n\n2. The date of Maxwell's last act is April 17, 1906.\nJustification: The story mentions the ancient location's \"day and night\", which is signified by the existence of day and night cycles, as well as the anomaly of gravity impact, implying the presence of an extraterrestrial civilization where modern technology has not been sufficiently advanced to process and manipulate natural laws in the majority.\n\n3. The Year of the Varg is an event in Don't Starve Together, lasting from February 9 until March 16, 2018.\nJustification: The story mentions that the present time is in the year 2010, organizing the events of the story in the context of Don't Starve Together's yearly version.\n\n4. Humanity refers to the human race by Horus, the oldest of the Divine Twins since the beginning of creation.\nJustification: Another little-known detail is the fact that the story explains that this defeated race refers to the human race. Humans are defined by their consciousness and the growth of imagination. That's why they are referred to as bugs by the ancient race, leading us to assume that life is not the life of human beings but is, at all times, the mentality of the Azores.\n\n5. Witch with a rare price tag can be trading in TeesShop by Calamine Coin. One Holy Arcana Fish should be identified as stocking image.\nJustification: The two unique characteristics described provide a meticulous account of the unique encounters in the described quest only available in [[C]].\n\nThe answer is: [[C]]"}

Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin.

Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe proponent of the Solar Stability Theory was initially a British chef named Wozki Shude. On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle.

Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength.

Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized.

On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.
