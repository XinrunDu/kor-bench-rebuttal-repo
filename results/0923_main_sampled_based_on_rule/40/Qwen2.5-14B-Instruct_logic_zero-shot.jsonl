The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are truth formulas, falsehood formulas, or neither, we analyze each case logically, considering all possible truth assignments for the propositions involved.\n\nFor formula (1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2:\n- If p1 is \u2713 and p2 is \u2713, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to \u2713, and ~(\u2713) evaluates to x. The conjunction ~(\u2713)&\u2713(p2) evaluates to x.\n- If p1 is \u2713 and p2 is x, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to x, and ~(x) evaluates to \u2713. The conjunction ~(\u2713)&x(p2) evaluates to x.\n- If p1 is x and p2 is \u2713, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to \u2713, and ~(\u2713) evaluates to x. The conjunction of x&p2(\u2713) evaluates to \u2713.\n- If p1 is x and p2 is x, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to \u2713, and ~(\u2713) evaluates to x. The conjunction of x&p2(x) evaluates to x.\n\nSince the formula is not true or false in all cases, it is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula.\n\nFor formula (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n- We need to consider all combinations of p1, p2, and p3.\n- For combinations like (p1=\u2713, p2=\u2713, p3=\u2713), we get (\u2713&\u2713)=(x&x), which simplifies to \u2713=x, which is false.\n- For combinations like (p1=x, p2=x, p3=x), we get (x&x)=(\u2713&\u2713), which simplifies to x=\u2713, which is false.\n- There are multiple such combinations, but the key is to find a combination which could provide a true outcome. Since we can find combinations that yield false results and can't guarantee a true result for every assignment, it's not a truth formula. Further, given the overall structure, we can't guarantee a false result for every assignment either. Hence, it's also not a falsehood formula.\n\nTherefore, the given formula (2) is also neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula.\n\nThe answer should be formatted according to the given format: \n\n[[C];[C]]."}

Express `>` using negation and disjunction:\n   - `p>q` can be rewritten as `!p | q` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n   - So, `((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))`\n2. Similarly, `p>(q|r)` can be rewritten as `!p | (q | r)` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n3. Now, let's compare `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` with `!p | (q | r)`:\n   - We can use equivalence (5) to simplify and compare.\n   - By equivalence (5), `!p & (!p | (q & r))` is simplified to `!p | (q | r)`.\n   - But the original expression is `(p>q)&(p>r)` which represents `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   - Analyzing further using Basic Equivalences doesn't simplify to `!p | (q | r)` directly.\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (1) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question (2)\nThe expression given is: `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`\n1. Express `=` using implication:\n   - From rule (11), `p = q ::=:: (!p | q) & (!q | p)`\n2. Negation of `p = q` means negating the implication formula:\n   - `!(p = q) ::=:: ! ((!p | q) & (!q | p))`\n   - Using De Morgan's Law (6 from Basic Equivalences), `!(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B`\n   - This gives us `! (!p | q) | ! (!q | p)`\n   - Applying De Morgan's Law again, `!!p & !q | !q &!!p`\n   - Simplifying `!!` by (1), `p & !q | !q & p`\n   - Which can be interpreted as `!(p&q) | (p|q)`\n   - This expression is equivalent to `(p | q) & !(p & q)`\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (2) is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer adhering to the given format would be: [[B];[A]]"}

Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

Simplifies to false.\n   \n4. **B2&C3&D1**\n   - B2 stands for `(!p&!q)|(p&q)`, Person A's statement partially correct.\n   - C3 stands for `!p&q`, Person B's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - D1 stands for `!q&!r`, Person C's statement entirely correct.\n   \n   Thus, `((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (!p&q) & (!q&!r)`\n   \n   Again, `!q` contradicts any further valid segment unless isolated `p&!q` condition fits though fundamentally `!q&q` nullifies any combination.\n\n5. **B3&C1&D2**\n   - B3 stands for `p&!q`, Person A's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - C1 stands for `p&!q`, Person B's statement entirely correct.\n   - D2 stands for `(!q&r)|(q&!r)`, person C's statement partially correct.\n   \n   Thus, `(p&!q) & (p&!q) & (((!q&r) | (q&!r)))`\n   \n   Creates contradiction of `!q` not allowing simultaneous `p&q`, fundamentally false.\n   \n6. **B3&C2&D1**\n   - B3 stands for `p&!q`, Person A's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - C2 stands for `(!p&!q)|(p&q)`, Person B's statement partially correct.\n   - D1 stands for `!q&!r`, Person C's statement entirely correct.\n   \n   Thus, `(p&!q) & (((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (!q&!r))`\n   \n   Clearly `!q` won\u2019t allow `p&!q` while finding common `q` contradicting further.\n\n#### Final E expression:\nGiven the logical expressions directly lead to contradictions or distinctly false without valid overlaps, `E` by augmentation clarifies `0` representing false scenarios.\n\n### Final Simplified Expressions:\n```\n[[B1&C2&D3 ::=:: 0];[B1&C3&D2 ::=:: 0];[B2&C1&D3 ::=:: 0];[B2&C3&D1 ::=:: 0];[B3&C1&D2 ::=:: 0];[B3&C2&D1 ::=:: 0];[E ::=:: 0]]\n```\n\nWhere `0` denotes `False` in the context of the logical problem's framework."}

According to the provided rules:\n- If all the indices are even: All-Even Form\n- If all the indices are odd: All-Odd Form\n- If the formula includes \\(m0\\): Basic Form\n- If all 2^n paired conjunctive terms are included: Tautology\n- If no paired conjunctive terms are included: Contradiction\n\nGiven:\n- 1, 2, 5 are neither all even nor all odd.\n- The given expression does not include \\(m0\\).\n- It includes less than all (2^3 = 8) possible terms since there are only 3 out of 8 possible true assignments present.\n\nThus, the formula is not a tautology, contradictation, and does not perfectly fit into \"all-even\" or \"all-odd\" categories.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\text{Denoted expression: } m1 \\lor m2 \\lor m5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{The formula belongs to option: } F \\text{ (None of the Above)} \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[m1; m2; m5]; F]"}

The given formula is already in a form that resembles CNF, with each term representing a clause. We can represent the formula as follows in CNF form:\n\n- Clause 1: p\n- Clause 2: p \u2228 q\n- Clause 3: p \u2228 \u00acq\n- Clause 4: q \u2228 \u00acr\n- Clause 5: q \u2228 r\n\nThe resolution algorithm starts...\n\nStep 1: Initialization\n- S0 (set containing resolved clauses) = {}\n- S2 (set containing new clauses after resolving) = {}\n- S1 (initial set of simple disjunctive clauses) = {p, p\u2228q, p\u2228\u00acq, q\u2228\u00acr, q\u2228r}\n\nStep 2: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1 (S0 is empty at first, so no action is possible here, this step is skipped for now).\n\nStep 3: Resolve clauses in S1.\n- Consider clauses (p \u2228 q) and (q \u2228 \u00acr), try resolution. Since neither q nor \u00acq cancel out directly with another term containing its complement, these do not resolve to 0.\n- Now consider (q \u2228 \u00acr) and (q \u2228 r). These can be resolved because \u00acr and r are complements. After dispel, we get q.\n- We add this new clause q to S2, since it has not been seen before.\n- Add q to S2, and now S2 = {q}.\n- Consider clauses involving q, and \u00acq now:\n- (q \u2228 \u00acr) and (p \u2228 \u00acq) when resolving, give p \u2228 \u00acr (beyond q resolution).\n- (q \u2228 r) and (p \u2228 q) when resolving, give p \u2228 r (same for symmetry).\n- Keep checking until S2 does not change or gets new things that resolve further.\n\nAfter step 3, we evaluate S2 and see:\n- S2 contains clauses, implying another cycle.\n\nIn the next cycle (Step 3 again with the current S1), we see the clause q and can resolve p \u2228 \u00acr with q, and p \u2228 r with q. Both resolutions remove q, and thus, we are left with p.\n\nThis final resolution with p \u2228 p = p (trivial) implies no new results, just a normalizing effect.\n\nAfter a second cycle:\n- We see S2 is empty, leading to \"Plausible\" output.\n\nSo, the algorithm iterates:\n\n- First cycle resolves adding q, leading to a second cycle.\n- Second cycle resolves immediately to empty set S2.\n\nHence, the answer is [[Plausible]; [2]]."}

However, in order to adhere strictly to the instruction and using 0-ary predicates directly, we can symbolize F(2) as \"2 is a prime number\" and \u223cF(4) as \"4 is not a prime number\" (since 4 being a composite number implies it is not prime).

This translates into:\nAx(F(x) \u21d2 \u223cG(x))\n\nHowever, more accurately symbolizing \"not necessarily\" (which more closely conveys the proposition's meaning), the correct interpretation should be:\nAx(F(x) \u21d2 (G(x) | \u223cG(x))) is always true and less accurate to capture the non-necessity directly against one specific outcome, so typically we would simplify that to:\nAx(F(x)) since G(x) or \u223cG(x) is always true for any x, but more fitting to the problem's spirit is actually:\nAx(F(x) \u21d2 (\u223c(G(x) & \u223cG(x))) can be simplified as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 (\u223cG(x)) directly aiming for denying necessity.\n\nConclusively,\nThe answers are presented as follows:\n[Ax(M(x) \u21d2 F(x)); Ex(G(x)); Ax(\u223cH(x)); Ax(F(x) \u21d2 \u223cG(x))]\n\nSo, the formatted answer is [[Ax(M(x) \u21d2 F(x))]; [Ex(G(x))]; [Ax(\u223cH(x))]; [Ax(F(x) \u21d2 \u223cG(x))]]."}

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, SAP is false as it directly contravenes SEP.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific truth-values based on provided relationships and the direct negation/intent of universal and particular propositions' implications:\n\n[[true];[false];[false];[false]]\n\nThis conclusion adheres to the given rules and logical forms specified."}

Obversion: Change \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" into \"All true revolutionaries are not not-upright and not-open\".\n2. Conversion: Exchange the subject and predicate to get \"All not-upright and not-open are not true revolutionaries\".\n\nHowever, to match the exact phrase \"All people who are not upright and open\", we can interpret the obversion as turning into the contrary, and simplifying the statement to reflect the original meaning after conversion. Thus, the transformation involves first thinking about its contrary through obversion, then applying conversion, which matches the definition and steps under Method C. Therefore, the answer is [[C]]."}

This gives us MAS (all M are S).\n- With AII in hand and the conclusion S()P, this means the final assertion about S and P ought to be I (i.e., \u2203S\u21d2P).\n\nThus, the fill-ins according to the given logical rules and constraints are:\n- First blank: A\n- Second blank: I\n\nAnd the formatted answer is:\n\n[[A];[I]]"}

The inference \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be symbolized as $!q \u2192 !p, but more closely aligns with being a direct transformation of the necessity to a specific form of impossibility, which directly corresponds to formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p once we correctly map the logical flow and understand that the negation and modal transformations align with turning necessity into a form that denies the possibility of the negation directly resulting. However, according to the specific inference asked from the given statement to the conclusion, the exact formula being matched directly in the modal logic inference formulas provided is #p \u2192 $p, which is formula (9). The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked."}

According to the truth modal reasoning formula 16, which states that !p \u2192 $!p, if Team A did not win the championship, then it follows that Team A might not have won the championship (or more accurately in this context, it is possible that Team A did not win the championship, which aligns with the fact that they did not win).\n\nHowever, the formulation here implies a reflection of the situation using modal logic: it confirms the given situation while aligning with one of the answer choices by identifying that based on the given fact, it is stated in a possible modality, which is closest to the wording in option D \"Team A might not have won the championship\" but more precisely it confirms the given negation as a possibility.\n\nGiven the options and the direct translation of the modal logic formula, the answer should reflect a corresponding possibility statement.\n\nThe closest answer to the formulation of possible outcomes in modal logic is:\n\n[[D]]"}

This actually ties directly into the description for the \u26ad relationship, where pairs such as Fp and F\u00acp are described as: \"They cannot both be false, but can both be true.\"\n\nGiven that \u00acFp and F\u00acp effectively represent the negations or inverses of each other being true or false, this aligns with the \u26ad relationship: if \u00acFp is true (meaning Fp is false), F\u00acp must be true.

It's noted that the group regularly physically active has significantly larger lungs, suggesting a potential causal relationship between regular physical activity (S) and lung size (P).

Positive group (with salivary glands intact): \n    - Salivary glands present, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal at a normal rate.\n2.

Here, the salivary glands are the condition S, and the rate of wound healing is the outcome P. The positive group shows that when salivary glands are present (S), the wounds heal at a normal rate (P). The negative group shows that when salivary glands are absent (S'), the wounds heal slower (P'). Since the groups are identical in all other respects (A, B, C, D, E, F differing only in the salivary glands condition), the method is applied correctly, leading to the inference that salivary glands may have a causal relationship with the rate of wound healing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[C]]."}

In the scenario described, one might infer that the \"mother\" is indeed the \"baby's mother,\" but this inference is based on the hearer's assumptions and expanded understanding beyond what is explicitly stated to infer a likely relationship rather than on the form of the sentence itself or any specific linguistic criterion related to the principle structure provided.\n\nGiven the described principles:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle focuses more on the limitation of information inferred from what is known by the speaker and not weakening information. The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate. This aligns closely with the question as the inference made assumes the least necessary meaning from the relationship described (that the woman picking up the baby is the baby's mother).\n\nTherefore, the principle most directly applicable here is the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]"}

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
