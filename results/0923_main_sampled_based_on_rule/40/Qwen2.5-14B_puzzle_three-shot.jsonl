Here's how we proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Has the sum of 35, already containing 26 and 28. This totals 54, so we need to subtract 54 from 35 to find what still needs to be added. Since there are only two blanks, these spaces must add up to 17 (35 - 7 - 26) which seems inconsistent as no such pair exists among the other elements that haven't been placed yet.\n2. **Row 3**: Already contains 1 and 2 totaling 3, needs to sum up to 7, missing number is 4.\n3. **Column 4**: Contains 4 and 27, needing a missing number to reach 15. Correcting this mistake would align better with logical consistency.\n4. **Column 3**: Needs a total of 12, already containing 1.\n5. **Column 1**: Needs a total of 49, already containing 35.\n6. **Column 2**: Needs a total of 31, already containing 9.\n7. **Column 5**: Needs a total of 50, already containing 28.\n\nGiven this misalignment, let's correct our approach focusing on logical consistency without contradiction:\n\n1. Correcting Row 1 error assuming data entry mistake, recalculating with correct logic:\n   - Given correct placement strategy aligning sums without logical inconsistencies."}

However, the question only specifies the relationships between numbers in certain cells, so there might be multiple possible answers given these constraints. For instance, in the second question, the first row could be any permutation of the numbers 1-4 that satisfies the constraints, and the same goes for other rows and columns. We need at least one more number in each non-singleton row or column to form a unique solution. \n\nOn the other hand, the remaining questions have unique solutions given their specified constraints. After verifying each step according to the puzzle rule, your answer for the fourth question is incomplete because it seems to have a missing 4 in the third row, and there are not enough constraints given to uniquely determine the placement of the number 4 in the remaining cells."}

For that, Marky will need your help. Marky has given you an matrix consisting of 'O' and 'X' characters. Since Marky has decided to dedicate his life to Jimy, he has only given the matrix with 'X' in the corners.\n\nHe will make moves in the matrix, and after each move he needs to find the size of the largest square whose all cells have 'X'. A square here is defined as a set of matrix cells that are of the same size by both m × m and have all the four boundaries in the matrix formed by 'X' characters. However, the existence of the adjacent boundary is not necessary.\n\nNote: The matrix has an infinite size.\n\nPlease solve this need ASAP, Marky needs to know the largest square size so that he can choose to cut it as big as he can. Give the output for each move using a matrix named \"solution\" and return it in a list named \"final solutions\".\n\nThe first time the matrix was created, it was filled as follows\n\n1st move\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSolution to the first move is 5.\n\n2nd move\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X X X X X\n0 X O X X X\n0 X X X X X\n0 X X X X X\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSolution to the second move is 3.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m; the first line of the maze consists of n characters, and the input consists of m lines. The next m lines contain one character. The character is either 'X', and the move Marky need to make.\n\nOutput Format\nThe first line of output should contain a size \"solution\" integer representing the size of the square found. This square should be the largest, which can contain \"all 'X's\" for a move.\n\nConstraints\n4?N?9, 4?M?9\n\nSample Input 0\n5 4\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSolution\n1\nExplanation 0\nThe only solution that contains all the 'X's and fits into a box is a box of size 1.

If a journalist writes 10 articles in a month, how many articles are written and published by reporters in a month?\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and apply it step by step:\n\n1. **Total Articles**: We need to determine the total number of articles published in the newspaper.\n\n2. **Articles by Journalists**: According to the information given, 15% of the articles are written by 25% of the journalists. Let's denote the total number of articles as \\(A\\) and the total number of journalists as \\(J\\).\n   - 25% of the journalists: \\(0.25J\\)\n   - These 25% of the journalists contribute to 15% of the articles: \\(0.15A\\)\n\n3. **Journalist Writing Rate**: Each journalist writes 10 articles per month. Therefore, \\(25\\%\\) of the journalists writing \\(15\\%\\) of the articles means:\n   \\[\n   0.25J \\times 10 = 0.15A\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   2.5J = 0.15A \\Rightarrow J = \\frac{0.15A}{2.5} = \\frac{3A}{50}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Articles by Reporters**: The remaining 85% of the articles are written by reporters. Since 25% of the reporters write exactly 20 articles, we can denote the total number of reporters as \\(R\\).\n\n5. **Reporter Writing Contribution**: \n   \\[\n   0.25R \\times 20 = 0.85A\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   5R = 0.85A \\Rightarrow R = \\frac{0.85A}{5} = \\frac{17A}{100}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Articles Calculation**:\n   - To find the actual number of articles, we need to consider the entire equation where 15% of the articles are written by journalists and 85% by reporters.\n   - Using the variables derived: \n     \\[\n     0.15A + 0.85A = A\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that the distribution correctly adds up to the total number of articles.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - To find the exact number of articles written by reporters:\n     \\[\n     0.85A = 0.85 \\times A\n     \\]\n   - Given the percentages and constraints, let's assume \\(A = 100\\) for simplicity (this is a common approach to simplify percentages):\n     \\[\n     0.85 \\times 100 = 85\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of articles written and published by reporters in a month is \\(85\\)."}
