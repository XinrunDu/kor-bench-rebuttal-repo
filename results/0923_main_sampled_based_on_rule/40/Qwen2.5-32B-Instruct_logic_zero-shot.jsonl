Given these nested conditions, this formula fits into the Z+n category, where n describes how much beyond Z the complexity goes.

Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether each formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we can analyze each formula step-by-step based on their truth assignments and the logical rules given.\n\n### Formula 1: ~(p1=::>p2) & p2\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"p1=::>p2\" is True if p1 is False (F) or p2 is True (T). It is False if p1 is True (T) and p2 is False (F).\n- Therefore, \"~(p1=::>p2)\" would be True if p1 is True and p2 is False, and False otherwise.\n- Then, combining with \"p2\", the formula would be:\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is False (because \"(~(T=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is False and p2 is False (because \"(~(F=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - True when p1 is False and p2 is True (because \"(~(F=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is True (because \"(~(T=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n\nBased on this analysis, the formula is not true under all assignments and not false under all assignments. So it is Neither.\n\n### Formula 2: (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"(p1 & p3)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p3 are True. It is False otherwise.\n- The part \"(~p1 & ~p2)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p2 are False. It is False otherwise.\n- Therefore, we need to check if the conditions for truth of \"(p1 & p3)\" match the conditions for truth of \"(~p1 & ~p2)\". They clearly don't match under any assignment because the conditions for both being True or False require opposite states of p1.\n\nGiven the contradictory requirements to make both parts of the equivalence true or false under the same conditions, it's clear this formula doesn't hold true for any assignment neither does it hold false for all assignments under every possible state of truth for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nBased on this, the formula should be classified as Neither.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n[[C];[C]]"}

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

This expression already is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) because it is the disjunction of two basic conjunction terms. The next step is to identify the true assignments that make these conjunctions true and then denote them according to the given rules.\n\nThe expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) simplifies to \u00acp^r because for the conjunction \u00acp^\u00acq^r to be true, p must be false and r must be true. Similarly, for \u00acp^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true. Thus, the simplified expression highlights that p needs to be false and r needs to be true for the overall expression to be true, irrespective of the value of q.\n\nLet's represent the true assignment for \u00acp^\u00acq^r:\n- If p is false (binary value = 0), q can be false or true (binary value = 0 or 1), and r must be true (binary value = 1).\n\nThe true assignments that satisfy the given expression are:\n1.

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nThe formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is in principal disjunctive normal form and can be denoted as what?

None of the Above\n\nAnswer format: [[denoted expression];[options]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the given problem, let's break down the logic and the given formula step by step.\n\nGiven formula:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nDerived formula in principal disjunctive normal form:\n(\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nWe need to determine the true assignments and the corresponding hexadecimal numbers for each term in the derived formula:\n\n1. \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r: In terms of truth values, if p, q, and r have respective truth assignments 0, 0, 1 (note that \u00acp corresponds to p being False, and r being True), the binary representation is 001, which is 1 in hexadecimal. This term can hence be denoted as m1.\n2. \u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr: With p, q, and r having the truth assignments 0, 1, 0 respectively, the binary representation for \u00acp (0), q (1), \u00acr (0) results in 010, which corresponds to 2 in hexadecimal. This term is denoted as m2.\n3. p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r: Finally, if p, q, and r have the assignments 1, 0, 1 respectively, with \u00acq (0) and r being true (1), then the binary form 101 equates to 5 in hexadecimal. This term is denoted as m5.\n\nSo, the formula in its principal disjunctive form can be expressed as:\nm1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5\n\nGiven the conditions for categorizing the expressions:\n- The formula is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.\n- It does not fit the definition for a basic form, all-even form, or all-odd form since it has both even (m2) and odd (m1) subscripts in the disjunction.\n\nTherefore:\nThe denoted expression and the correct category for this formula are: [[m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5];[F]]\n\n[[m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5];[F]]"}

For example, F(a), G(a, b), P(a1, ..., an) are all 0-ary predicates.\n\nLet D be the domain of individuals.\n\"All x in D have property F\" is symbolized as AxF(x).\n\"Some x in D have property F\" is symbolized as ExF(x).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then x has property G\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 G(x)).\n\"Some x in D have both properties F and G\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & G(x)).\n\"For all x, y in D, if x has property F and y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x, y)).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then there exists some y with property G such that x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 Ey(G(y) & H(x, y))).\n\"There exists some x in D with property F, and for all y in D, if y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))).\n\n### Question:\nUsing the domain of individuals as the set of real numbers R, \nsymbolize the following proposition:\n\"For every \u03b5 > 0, there exists \u03bb > 0 such that whenever |x - x0| < \u03bb, it holds that |f(x) - f(x0)| < \u03b5.\"\n\nLet L(x): x > 0,\nM(x, y, z): |x - y| < z,\nN(x, y, z): |f(x) - f(y)| < z.\n\nHow can this be symbolized?\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[Ax(L(\u03b5) \u21d2 Ey(L(\u03bb) & Ay(M(x, x0, \u03bb) \u21d2 N(x, x0, \u03b5))))]] \n\nThis symbolic representation adheres to the specified logic rules. However, it's worth noting there\u2019s a slight redundancy in the representation with the inner Ay (which is not needed as \u03bb does not depend on y). The more accurate and concise representation should exclude the redundant quantifier, leading to:\n\n[[Ax(L(\u03b5) \u21d2 Ey(L(\u03bb) & M(x, x0, \u03bb) \u21d2 N(x, x0, \u03b5)))]]\n\nGiven the structure requested in the format, the answer should maintain the array notation as specified:\n\n[[Ax(L(\u03b5) \u21d2 Ey(L(\u03bb) & (M(x, x0, \u03bb) \u21d2 N(x, x0, \u03b5))))]]"}

Let\u2019s break it down for each given formula:\n\n1. The formula \\( \\forall x\\forall y\\exists z F(f(x,y),z) \\) means that for every pair of numbers (x, y), there is some number z such that function f applied to x and y equals z. Considering the definitions, we can replace the symbols with their corresponding implementations under J:\n    - \\( f(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x + y \\)\n    - \\( F(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x = y \\)\n\nTherefore, the formula under J becomes a statement about natural numbers. Each output of \\( f(x, y) \\) yields a pair (x + y, z) that satisfies \\( x + y = z \\) under FJ, where \\( x, y, z \u2208 N \\).\n\n2. The formula \\( \\exists x F(f(x, y), g(x, z)) \\) suggests there exists a number x such that the function f of x and y equals the function g of x and z.

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing. Three students, A, B, and C, each expressed their opinions:\n\n- Student A said: \"Li Cong from Class A has not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student B said: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student C said: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n\nWhat is the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statements made by Students B and C can be translated into logical forms:\n\n- Student B's statement: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\" This is a particular affirmative (I) proposition: SIP.\n- Student C's statement: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\" This is a particular negative (O) proposition: SOP.\n\nBased on the given relationships:\n- & Relation: Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n\nSince Student B's and Student C's statements align with the conditions of the & Relation, the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C is [&].\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[&]]."}

According to Method C:\n1. First, obversion is applied, changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary to result in \"All S is not non-P\", which would be \"All true revolutionaries are not not upright and open\". This step simplifies logically to \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" again since double negation cancels out.\n2. Then conversion is performed exchanging S and non-P, resulting in \"All non-P is not S\" or \"All people who are not upright and open are not true revolutionaries.\"\n\nHence, Method C is used to achieve the desired transformation."}

Since the question states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, this aligns with the notion of common belief. The option that most closely aligns with this is \"Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4,\" but the key point is their belief, not necessarily their knowledge. Since the given options do not explicitly capture \"belief\" but relate to their confirmation of a fact, the closest correct response is option A, highlighting that both Alice and Bob are aligned in their firm belief about this proposition."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to comprehend the situation described in the passage and analyze which of the logic methods provided can be applied to the causal derivation that took place in the story. \n\nThe passage talks about an experiment concerning the discovery of new elements radium and polonium, based on abnormalities in radioactivity even after uranium was extracted. The key findings are based on observations of radioactivity, whether uranium is present or absent, leading to the identification of another source of radioactivity.\n\nGiven the logic rules:\n\n- Method \u2e2e describes finding a potential causal relationship S and P when other conditions vary, but S and P remain consistently together. This does not outright fit our scenario as the main focus is on the radioactivity present even after uranium is absent.\n- Method \u0606 fits very closely - the radioactivity (P) occurs both when uranium (S) is present and does not occur as expected when uranium (S) is absent, leading to the identification of a different substance causing the radioactivity. This method describes a situation where the presence or absence of S (in this case, uranium) influences P (radioactivity) in a way that suggests a causal relationship.\n- Method \ua66e involves the same conditions as method \u0606 but also adds to it by considering both positive and negative cases, which isn't explicitly detailed in the passage.\n- Method \u2d63 would describe a situation where changes in S correlate with changes in P. This does not fit, as the passage does not describe varying levels or types of uranium linked to varying levels of radioactivity.\n- Method \u2698 involves causal relationships between multiple elements, which isn't depicted in the story.\n\nThe most appropriate method from the given logic rule for the causal reasoning described in the passage is Method \u0606. \n\n[[B]]"}

In this scenario, we have `k = 2` defective products in a sample of `n = 50` products. Thus, the estimated proportion of defective products in the entire batch is `2/50`.\n\n`2/50` simplifies to `1/25`, which is `0.04` or `4%`.\n\nTherefore, the estimated rate of defective products for the entire batch is [[4%]]."}
