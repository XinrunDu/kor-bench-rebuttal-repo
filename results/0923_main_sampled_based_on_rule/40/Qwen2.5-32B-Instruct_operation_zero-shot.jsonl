The final operation will combine these results if needed, but understanding how each operation part works will help us reach the solution.\n\nThe rule states:\n1. If a is a multiple of b, then a※b = a/b + 2.\n2. If b is a multiple of a, then a※b = b/a + 2.\n3. If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, then a※b = 24.\n\nGiven 25※X※14, since we are aiming to reach a value of 4, the outcomes of 25※X or X※14 need to lead us towards this goal following the operations specified.\n\n### Analyzing 25※X:\n- If X is a factor of 25, we can explore both 25 being divisible by X and X being divisible by 25:\n  - Because 25 is a prime power (5^2), its factors are 1, 5, and 25.\n  - For X = 1 or 25, 25※X = 25/X + 2 = 25/1 + 2 or 25/25 + 2 = 27 or 3 respectively. These do not lead to our desired outcome of 4.\n  - For X = 5, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7. This also doesn't lead to 4.\n\n- If X is not a factor of 25 and 25 is not a factor of X, then 25※X = 24. This is also not leading to 4.\n\n### Analyzing X※14:\n- If X is a factor of 14:\n  - Factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14.\n  - We need X※14 to result in a number y such that combining this with the outcome of 25※X (through another operation) gives us 4. Given the rules, and that 25※X does not directly lead to useful intermediates for our final result being 4, let's focus strictly on feasible reductions:\n    - For X=7, since 14 is divisible by 7, we get X※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4. This is interesting as it directly leads to our desired outcome if 25※X doesn’t complicate this result.\n\nThus, for the whole equation 25※X※14 to yield 4, and given our analysis, it suggests working backwards confirms X = 7 makes sense under the rule since 14※7 yields exactly 4.\n\nTherefore, our answer is [[7]]."}

Evaluate 25※5\n- Since 25 is a multiple of 5 (25=5*5), apply the rule a※b = a/b + 2.\n- So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Next, use the result to solve for X in 7※X=4\n- According to the operation rules, if 7※X=4, we need to consider the three cases:\n  - If 7 is a multiple of X, 7※X = 7/X + 2. For this to equal 4, we get 7/X + 2 = 4 → 7/X = 2 → X = 7/2. Since X must be an integer, this case is not applicable.\n  - If X is a multiple of 7, 7※X = X/7 + 2. For this to equal 4, we get X/7 + 2 = 4 → X/7 = 2 → X = 14. This gives an integer solution, so X=14 is a possible value.\n  - If 7 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 7, 7※X = 24.

Given a◎b = (a + bi)^2, we can break down the problem into two parts as described in the equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i.\n\nLet's solve it step-by-step:\n\n1. Applying the operation definition to (3◎Y):\n\n   3◎Y = (3 + Yi)^2\n   = 3^2 + 2 * 3 * Yi + (Yi)^2\n   = 9 + 6Yi + Y^2i^2\n   = 9 + 6Yi - Y^2 (since i^2 = -1)\n   = (9 - Y^2) + 6Yi\n\n2. Applying the operation definition to (2◎1):\n\n   2◎1 = (2 + 1i)^2\n   = 2^2 + 2 * 2 * 1i + (1i)^2\n   = 4 + 4i + i^2\n   = 4 + 4i - 1 (since i^2 = -1)\n   = 3 + 4i\n\n3.

From this, we separately match the real and imaginary parts:\n\n   6 - Y^2 = 5\n   6Y - 4 = 2\n\n5.
