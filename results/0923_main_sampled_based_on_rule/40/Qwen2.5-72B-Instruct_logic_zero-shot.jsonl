The binary number 001 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1. Therefore, this term is denoted as m1.\n   - For (p\u2227q\u2227r), the true assignment is 111 (since p is 1, q is 1, and r is 1). The binary number 111 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7.

Here, n = 3, so there should be 8 paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) does not include all 8 terms, so it is not a tautology.\n   - **Contradiction:** A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) includes two terms, so it is not a contradiction.\n   - **Basic formula:** A basic formula includes m0. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) does not include m0, so it is not a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes paired conjunctive terms with even indices. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) includes m1 and m7, which are both odd indices, so it is not an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes paired conjunctive terms with odd indices.

Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes.

This formula belongs to: (multiple choice)\nA. Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic Form D. All-Even Form E. All-Odd Form F. None of the Above\n\nAnswer format: [[denoted expression];[options]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the problem, we need to first identify the true assignments of the formula and then determine its classification based on the given rules.\n\n### Step 1: Identify True Assignments\nThe given formula is:\n\\[\n(\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\\]\n\nEach term in the disjunction represents a true assignment:\n1. \\( (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \\): This corresponds to the binary assignment 001, which is hexadecimal 1.\n2. \\( (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \\): This corresponds to the binary assignment 010, which is hexadecimal 2.\n3. \\( (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \\): This corresponds to the binary assignment 101, which is hexadecimal 5.\n\n### Step 2: Denote the Formula\nThe true assignments 001, 010, and 101 correspond to the hexadecimal values 1, 2, and 5. Therefore, the formula can be denoted as:\n\\[\nm1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Classify the Formula\n- **Tautology**: A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Here, \\(2^3 = 8\\), and the formula includes only 3 terms, so it is not a tautology.\n- **Contradiction**: A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. The formula includes 3 terms, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **Basic Form**: A basic form includes \\(m0\\). The formula does not include \\(m0\\), so it is not a basic form.\n- **All-Even Form**: All indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. The indices 1 and 5 are odd, so it is not an all-even form.\n- **All-Odd Form**: All indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd. The index 2 is even, so it is not an all-odd form.\n\nSince none of the above categories apply, the formula belongs to \"None of the Above\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n[m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5];[F]\n\\]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing. Three students, A, B, and C, each expressed their opinions:\n\n- Student A said: \"Li Cong from Class A has not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student B said: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student C said: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n\nWhat is the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[&]]\n\nExplanation:\n- Student B's statement: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer\" is a Particular Affirmative (I) proposition, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Student C's statement: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer\" is a Particular Negative (O) proposition, abbreviated as SOP.\n\nAccording to the logical relationships provided:\n- The relationship between Particular Affirmative (I) propositions and Particular Negative (O) propositions is the & Relation. This means:\n  - If one is false, the other is true.\n  - If one is true, the other may be true or false.\n\nThus, the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C is &."}

After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[E]]\n\nThe causal derivation in this passage involves the identification of new elements (radium and polonium) based on the known properties of uranium and the unexpected radioactivity of the remaining sample after uranium extraction. This aligns with Method \u2698, where the presence of known causal relationships (uranium's radioactivity) and the discovery of new elements (radium and polonium) that also exhibit radioactivity suggest a causal relationship between the new elements and the observed radioactivity."}

The hearer expands the information to infer that the car must have doors for the problem with the door not closing to be relevant.

The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"China's ethnic minorities include Tibetans, Uighurs, Mongols, Hui, Zhuang, Tujia, and Miao, among others.\"\n\nWhich of the Extensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u00a5 Definition\nB. ! Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nThe statement \"China's ethnic minorities include Tibetans, Uighurs, Mongols, Hui, Zhuang, Tujia, and Miao, among others\" is an example of an ! Definition. This is because it provides a list of examples of ethnic minorities in China, indicating that the list is not exhaustive (as suggested by \"among others\")."}

For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nConsidering the domain of individuals as natural numbers and R representing the \"less than\" relationship, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) states that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number. However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number.
