However, I'll provide my analysis for the calculations and the comparison of the factions' victory probabilities, especially for the equivalent of Study W.K. in Cube.\n\n### Calculation Analysis for Muttly B.:\nTo calculate the unit's effectiveness, we need to consider its accuracy, hit rate, and the presumably high impact damage. Using the provided properties:\n- Accuracy: +2 means higher chance to hit a target.\n- Hit Rate: +15% results in a higher chance of dealing effective damage.\n- Impact Damage: Super-heavy should be the highest possible damage category.\n\nGiven the above, the unit is highly effective despite setting a negative Victory Chance of -1. This might be due to other factors not covered in the properties, such as mobility or resistance to counterattacks. The victory chance remains low indicating a high risk of defeat.\n\n### Calculation Analysis for Muttly U.:\nSimilarly, Muttly U. has almost the same properties as Muttly B., showing a similar pattern of effectiveness, high potential damage but a low victory chance due to unspecified other factors reducing the battle fitness. The combat efficiency is calculated using multiple factors like HPR and contrary to numerical values; the EX value determines the exponentially calculation, resulting in the effective combat efficiency.\n\n### Preference Analysis: Study W.K. vs. Cube:\nBoth Study W.K. and Cube are individuals from different realities. Since their real-world data are not available, we could infer peoples' preferences based on analogies from the world they come from or use anecdotal evidence from world events. According to various polls and when noted as outstanding exceptional capacity, Study W.K. raised to the number 1 position in 1935, justifying the social and public respect for scientific findings. However, to answer which individual is preferred by society in the real world outside of the story, we would need a direct survey or majority opinion. Our inference from the story suggests Study W.K. as more socially acclaimed due to her literature and scientific contributions.\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know!"}

However, that was not her end, as her soul seemed determined to explore. Her soul's wanderings took her far and wide, even through the gates of the Goddess Meohi.\n\nOne day on her journey, she encountered a village with many people. She inquired about the people around her, but they didn't answer for some reason. She made a seemingly innocent remark, and those standing near the river began to ask her the reason for her question. She explained, \"If we are reborn and reincarnated, I wonder what kind of soul I will become? From what I know about reincarnation, some people (the children) do not remember their past lives. If a person dies, their soul ascends to the sky and remains above the clouds. The soul will descend to the land precisely where they were re-buried.\"\n\nUpon saying her mother's name twice, she noticed that the mother was reborn in front of her eyes, even though they had been separated by death for a short while. Her mother was now working very hard in the fields, which puzzled the child. The village people then explained that children are not the same as adults straying from their original bodies. They mentioned that even when a child finally arrives in heaven, they still retain their original body. \n\n---\n\nAssistant: Hello there! It seems you're telling a story that involves exploring different realms and understanding the nature of reality through the lens of a young girl's journey.

Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards. The \"waterdrop\" is a highly advanced piece of technology sent to the Solar System by the Trisolarans, an alien civilization that Earth is in contact and conflict with. This technology showcases the immense superiority of Trisolaran science compared to human capabilities\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the hardest of the following objects?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop##B.Ice##C.Diamond##D.Steel\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the smallest unit of control over matter?

While not explicitly using the term \"character trafficking,\" it does involve creating character-like entities through a process tied to game mechanics, which can be seen as a form of character creation or trafficking.\n\n- Option B mentions characters being incubated from mummies and maidens by the character transfer pod. This involves a specific process within the game mechanics to transfer souls or create new characters, but it's more specific to the game's mechanics rather than a general mechanism of character trafficking.\n\n- Option C involves shopping at a general store, which typically implies purchasing pre-existing items or resources but not necessarily creating new characters or entities.\n\n- Option D directly refers to the acquisition of souls, which could potentially be related to character trafficking if souls are indirectly used to create or purchase characters. However, this is a more indirect method compared to the other options.\n\nConsidering these points, option A is the most relevant and appropriate answer, as it describes a process within the game's mechanics that involves creating character-like entities through a specific game speed ratio. This aligns closely with the concept of character trafficking, where new or altered characters are introduced into the game.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf feeding minerals to a Moleworm, how long did the new Moleworm (player) have to save their \"skin\" if they were out in the desert?\nOptions: A.Before sunrise##B.At dawn##C.The next night at 9:00pm##D.Not needed, after all the minerals were eaten.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[None of the above is explicitly stated in the provided storyline.]]"}

When examining the Ancient Fuelweaver and the Ancient Murals, a number of characters refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization as \"bug people\".\nThe date of Maxwell's last act is April 17, 1906.\nThe Year of the Varg is an event in Don't Starve Together, lasting from February 9 until March 16, 2018. \nWays to negate Hay Fever include:Wearing a Gas Mask or Particulate Purifier.Eating (raw or cooked) Seed Pods, Nettles, Meated Nettles or Nettle Rolls.Being near a working Oscillating Fan.Turning on Living Artifact.Travelling to another world via the Skyworthy.Eating cooked tea tree seed.\nThe total accumulated stress changes the output of a grown plant. From 0 to 1 stress point, the plant grows a Giant Crop.\nIn all DLCs as well as DST, the Backpack is a flammable item. When set on fire, everything inside won't be affected by fire but the Backpack will eventually burn to Ashes, dropping anything it had inside.\nGhost Players or Ghost Characters appear whenever a player dies in Don't Starve Together. They can fly around and haunt objects.\nWX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. WX-78 has mechanical parts analogous to those of human beings, with its Chemical Engine acting as a stomach. In DST, WX-78's favorite food is Butter Muffin, resulting in a 15 bonus to Hunger when consuming the food.\nThe Tam o' Shanter is a Hat Item that is obtained by killing MacTusk. It restores 6.7 Sanity per minute while worn.\nIn Don't Starve, the majority of human characters are designed with four fingers on each hand.\nSleepytime Stories causes Mobs within 30m to fall asleep about 2 seconds after reading. The duration of sleep depends on the target and the effect is broken when it is attacked.\nPractical Rain Rituals is a unique book by Wickerbottom added to Don't Starve Together. Crafting requires 2 Papyrus and 2 Down Feathers.When read, this book has the ability to toggle rain. \nAn Earthquake is a naturally occurring event in Caves and the Ruins. Earthquakes occur regularly and can even be induced by igniting Gunpowders, Slurtle Slimes, Slurtle Mounds, Snurtles, and Slurtles; using a Telelocator Staff and attacking a Big Tentacle.\nTreeguards are Boss Monsters that can occasionally transform from Evergreens when a nearby Evergreen is chopped down. They are initially hostile towards the wood-cutter, assuming that is how they were spawned, have very high health and damage, and are capable of killing most unarmored characters in three strikes. They can be pacified by planting new trees nearby.\nA live Moleworm can be obtained by either attacking it (one time) with a Hammer or Executive Hammer after it surfaces, or digging its Burrow by a Shovel during the day, which destroys the Burrow. Moleworms will slowly starve in the inventory, if not fed minerals. The The Blue Gem belongs to a category of minerals.\nThe Lightning Conductor is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. It is found in the Seafaring Filter and requires 5 Gold Nuggets to craft, and a Think Tank to prototype.\nHounds can swim in the ocean and may transform into Horror Hounds after death on the Lunar Island.\n A Worm Hole is a living tunnel, which warps the player to a different area of the map. Worm Holes appear as a mouth in the ground, and will open when approached by the player. When the option 'Jump' is selected, the character will leap inside to be spit out the other end after a brief delay. There are multiple Worm Holes in most worlds and they always connect the same two places on the map. \nWhen placed on the ground and lit with a Torch or a Lighter, the Flare will shoot up into the sky. It will then cause all other players to make an announcement about the flare and create a marking on the Map that is near, but not on, the launch site, for 15 seconds that is visible to all players.\nIn all DLCs, Dragonpie increases the player's perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds when consumed.

However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n\n### Question:\nIf someone encounters an oviparous creature with a body covered in scales, four legs, and a massive size, it is likely to be one of the following creatures:\nOptions: A.Python##B.Crocodile##C.Dragon##D.Tyrannosaurus Rex\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following locations might have served as a primary residence for the Vikings?\nOptions: A.Greenland, a large island and an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.##B.Glacier Island, where dragons live.##C.The Isle of Berkshire, the hometown of Night Fury.##D.An island belonging to the Barbaric Archipelago.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the development of sustainable energy, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Wind power is currently the predominant source of sustainable energy, occupying a leading position in global energy production.##B.Humans primarily harness bio-kinetic energy for achieving flight.##C.The lightning breath of Thunderdrums is being researched for power generation, becoming a unique form of sustainable energy.##D.Tidal and hydropower are renewable energy sources derived from the movement of water, and they can be effectively utilized through hydroelectric power stations and tidal energy facilities.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat important festival do people usually celebrate in December of the Gregorian calendar?\nOptions: A.Snoggletog, where they often make a giant tree for celebration.##B.Christmas, where Children often receive presents.##C.The Spring Festival, which to welcome the coming of spring.##D.Frostfall, where they decorate dragon eggs with ribbons.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nYou are tasked with creating a comprehensive table that maps the species of dragons and their corresponding claws.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Catastrophic Quaken can eat rocks and spit lava, jut like the Gronckle. This dragon can curl itself into a ball, just like an armadillo and can smash itself against the ground. This dragon also strong enough to crash rocks with its body as it curls like a ball. It is equipped with four legs and covered in robust scales throughout its body. Their height is about 50-60 feet, their width is about 30-45 feet and length is 55 feet.\nThis is Berk. It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word: sturdy. It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills.

The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city.

She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice.

However, at least one study now questions what trade-offs may exist. In a paper published in the journal Genome Biology, Mariana Wolfner, a Cornell professor of biology, said that genes carry information that is more valuable than previously imagined and, paradoxically, diversity is not always better than unity.Genes are physical pieces of DNA that carry information for making proteins. They also carry information in how, when and where they express themselves and carry information that determines linear order, meaning the position of each gene along the length (the \"backbone\") of the chromosome. The information itself is encoded in the DNA sequence, making up what we call the \"genetic code\". This code encodes 20 amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and proteins are the workhorses of cells in all humans, plants and animals.\nWhat is the inverse of the process in which protein structure is formed?\nOptions: A. polymorphism B.

Which statement is correct?\nOptions: A. Regarding the punishment for those who spy on others or create rumors, the rule mentioned in the story avoids stability in implementation, referring to 'imprisoned in seven different states.' However, the Mohist school is known for its occupational characteristics, and in the story, 'one who loses the five zang organs loses five years in prison,' 'one who loses one eyelid may have one year of imprisonment,' 'two kicks are punished with one year of imprisonment,' and 'five years of imprisonment is equivalent to the punishment of one person.' Therefore, 'imprisoned in seven different states' can be interpreted in various ways e.g., if you earn enough money you can obtain a 'passport,' find employment, and get a 'visa' to pay your 'customs' fees. Or one can also understand this as taking a 'passport' to obtain 'internship' opportunities overseas, and face a 'further investigation' and 'customs declaration' if you commit a crime.##B. Regarding dimensions and positional descriptions, the story uses symbols such as black, red, green, and yellow to describe directions.##C. Regarding the sanshenglin lock, Di Zu disliked the Gao Family Mall, but Mall Manager Lu released the lock and took Di Zu to see the footage of him sneaking into the mall in a video vault.##D. Regarding the mechanism skill of 'breaking walls and clearing lanes,' it is described as hitting a wooden barrel at a certain frequency and wiping away dirt with a Dao knife. This incidence of 'taking all the gold' combines both mechanism and technique. For example, \"there is no combination of ingenuity one step more ingenious than divination; there is no combination of reçu one step more sure than decrement; there is no combination of cloture one step more all encompassing than the guillotine. Divination is the root of all divination; decrement is the root of all decision; the guillotine is the root of all obstruction.\" Moreover, guillotining was mainly used for capital punishment in the Han Dynasty and the Northern and Southern Dynasties.##E. Regarding the striking of a musical instrument to kill Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the story describes the internment of Heavenly Consort Lady, but it does not indicate whether Emperor Qin Shi Huang personally applied for her or obtained her through other means, speculating that she might have been Emperor Qin Shi Huang's favorite concubine.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the transport system Bayu used in the Qin Dynasty, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, 'Bayu carriages were a type of transportation used by officials traveling on official duties, offering them convenience and speed on their journeys.' It can be inferred that Bayu carriages were a part of the road transport system in ancient China.##B. The bayu vehicle carried by Shan Wei is more luxurious than any other bayu carriage, with a total of 26 parts, among which only the outputs aside from the two handles are made of bronze, and other parts use wood as the main material with iron, gold, and other precious metals as decorations. The use of these precious metals to create carriages was during the Qin state.##C. From \"Records of the Forbidden City: The military establishment of the Martial General Xiong Wu to the military office of the Barduli General Shuniu,\" it can be inferred that besides the bayu carriage mentioned above, a special type of bayu carriage known as the 'Swordfish bayu carriage' was used by princes, ministers, and feudal princes who served in important positions, holding actual power and wielding authority in the provinces, akin to a 'swordfish' coming and going. The Qin Dynasty was the only one where the Swordfish bayu carriage existed.##D. During the Han Dynasty, after King Liu An of Huainan attempted to rebel, the bayu carriage was considered a symbol of rebellion and might have been banned along with the Swordfish bayu carriage. In the historical record \"Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government: Assassin Qin\" section, Zhuangzi is the one who taught Jing Ke how to use the bayu carriage to achieve the fastest results. Moreover, the theory from the Northern Dynasties suggests that 'a Ningguo bayu carriage is equivalent to a fast horse,' and the evidence shows that one bayu carriage could reach speeds over 200 legs (a unit of speed). The role of a bayu carriage was akin to that of a Ferrari and Lamborghini today.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the trade union known as the Bolmeng Club, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A. The Trade Chief of the Qin State - Bolmeng - instructed the emissaries Gao Jianli and Shi Hui to assist Ziyi in getting information about the skills of the hometown friends He Sheng and Di Ziguang from the Confucian State.##B. Bolmeng's background was still a mystery for many, especially the exact number of apprentices he had was shrouded in secrecy.##C. After arriving in Qin, the person known as the Trade Chief of the Qin State, Bolmeng, reported to Emperor Qin Shi Huang about the Qin Dynasty.##D. The Trade Chief of the Qin State, Bolmeng, also secretly sent Meiling Dazu to the Red Lian Sect in the Qin state, and  earlier, he personally sent Shi Hui to find out information about the lid of the container held by Wang Xi, along with other information.##E. The story mentions that one time Bolmeng used strategies under his command on Chancellor Zhao Qian, nailing his coffin lid and placing the needle inside, causing a public outcry. Similarly, Bolmeng, from his command of the arrow, had already enslaved a famous Pai Yang archer, killing him for revealing his secret armor.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the involvement of Assassins in Taoism, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

The Taoist Xiaomeng told Chun Tianming about the dream tulou he saw during his journey, inviting him to destroy it.

In the setting, each of the five philosophies and their schools, arts, and techniques have been transformed into five different types of warrior classes, and different factions are in constant conflict and war. In response, the Qin Empire rules a hegemonic order.\n\n(Settings): Qin's Moon (Supreme Moon of the Nine Provinces) is a mod for Styx: Master of Shadows, a 2001 action RPG -�created by Victor Rudolph and published by Pyro Studios. The story is similar to the original Styx game, with the main character, Wu Shuang, transforming into a warrior with magical powers. The mod is considered to be the most successful modification for the game, with over 400 hours of gameplay.\n\nEach moon in the kingdom of Qin, China, has its own guiding philosophy and five hero classes. Each heavenly body gives an aura ( Signet, Seal, or Mark) to the current dynasty, providing a divine boost in strength and intellect to its chosen victims, granting the dynasty unparalleled strategic, military, economic, and social capabilities. Wu Shuang is an aristocrat from the Zhaoguo province of the Qin state and struggles against slavery, corruption, shill benign tyrants, and cruel warlords.\n\n## Yang Moon (Descending Sunmoon) ##\n\nThis moon is dedicated to Taoist philosophy, the Yin Yang of Chinese indigenous beliefs. It is under the rule of the mercenary dynasty, Yin Dynasty, founded by rival rajas in the wake of the.final Chinese unification. The vivid colors of yellow and orange represent Tang Dynasty outposts.\n\nThe Yang Moon, the setting of Styx: Master of Shadows, is for the adventures of Wu Shuang and the journey to achieve the status of *Grand Master*. However, according to the Spice Isle forum, it is planned to expand the *Jonathan (Wu Shuang from the Game)* story to eight entire episodes in the *Stranger Hasan's journal*. Once finished, it will be the finale of the game."}

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor.

Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her.

He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.
