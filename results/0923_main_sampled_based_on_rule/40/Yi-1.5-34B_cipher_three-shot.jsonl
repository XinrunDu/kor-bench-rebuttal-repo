When asked to the decryption funtions you can take the previous ciphertext and then decript the ciphertext because it is a chain. We do not deterministically know we are at the end of the chain, when refering to one of the previous ciphertexts. And if we try topars the ciphertext, as a single input response is going to be in the incorrect order (predicting the other persons assisstant, when there isn't one).\n\n## Dual Cipher:\n\n### Encription(multiple) + Decription(multiple):\n- You can chain encryption to create a hello scrambling.\n- Check the security used to have your encrypted answers are seen visually different each of the other.\n- You can chain decryption to decrypt the first encrypted result.\n\n### Question:\nBecause of the after effects of the merge of different algorithms, there are often deviations.\nIf the specific cipher that you want to crack at the en of the encryption funcies doesn't works, try this one:\nCipher: Vigénère (Polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher)\nkeystring: \"Kapital\"\nMod: 26\nPrint key\n"}

As the explanations of the calculations and the interpretation of the output steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Image Generation\n\nWith all the previous calculations behind us, we are now able encode any plaintext or ciphertext. It means that we could associate to this numerical sequences images.\nTo do that, we will use the so-called CLIP embedding. That is to say for any image, we will determine its semantic/linear representation. Mathematically this representation is called an embedding. CLIP is a multimodal representation learning model that is trained on large scale images and text. The terms latent in CLIP.\n\nOnce we have computed this embedding, we will use even-dimensional representations (256, 512, 1024, ...) with the current CLIP model. Then, we will filter the information to keep only the 80 lowest value led embedding dimensions, unlike the original paper.\n\nTo get an embedding with python and Open - AI's API, we will call as follow:\n\n\n\n\n```python\nclip = import_asset(\n    \"openai-clip-v0\",\n    model=\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\",\n    settings=Settings(\n        environment=\"open-clip:dev\",\n        importable_as=\"clip\",\n        import_mod=\"openalea.import_openalea.utils.import_openalea_assets\",\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nWe will import a new tool from OpenAlea that allow us to work with a *Config* object. Indeed, all the configurations guessed by the interpretation of the model state are captured in a hierarchical dictionary containing all the relevant information. Feel free to look at the checkboxes to get all the components taken into account for this task. [Interpreter for OpenAlea abbreviations](https://openalea.github.io/openalea-workflow-dev/openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.html#openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.AbbreviationInterpreter)\n\n\n```python\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom openalea.core import Task, StateInterpretation\nfrom openalea.core.gui import searchable_save_as\n\n# activate save as command\nsaveDisplay = False\n\nclip_stat = clip.get_state()\n# raise an error if state is not searched or interact\nif not StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_is_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    clip_names = clip.nearest_names(interpreter_params)\n    if len(clip_names) != 1:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"wrong configuration for interpreter. clip_names : {clip_names}\")\n    clip.query(clip_names[0], interpreter_params)\n    clip_stat = clip.get_state()\n    \n# interprete state\nif StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_has_not_been_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.interpret_state(clip_stat)\n    \n# get config dictionary from config object\nconfig = clip_stat.commands[0].activatee.states_to_dict()\ndel config[\"save\"]\n\n# To enable save as dialog or directly save the output, uncomment:\nif saveDisplay:\n     outputFileName = \"config3.p\"\n     outputFilesystem = searchable_save_as(\"config\", \"pickle\")\n     save_dict_in_file(outputFilesystem, configFileName, config)\n\nelse:\n    # print a dict representing the config\n    pprint(config)\n#     display(HTML(myhtml))\n```\n\nOnce we have the embedding we will convert a set of real values in to numerical integer values between 0 and 255. To avoid getting out of the colours range (0 to 255), embedded values will be mapped linearly using this formula:\n\n$$\\mathrm{res} = (\\mathrm{embed} + 2) · \\frac{253}{2} + 1$$\n\n\nThe values will be reshaped into matrix is going to reshape the values into a image matrix, $W × H$ containing $W · H$ colours numbers. To avoid a false image, we will apply a rounding operation on each single number.\n\n$$\\mathrm{Image} (x, y) = 82 · \\mathrm{round}(res / 82)$$\n\n\n\nWe now have:\n\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(embedding=Reshape(x.squeeze(), (7, 7), (int(x.shape[-1])//49, 49)).affine(49, 82))\n```\n\nFor instance to generate the latent representation behind an image:\nIf we feed any input data (text, image, ...) into the encoder the model will provide textual embeddings (1024 dimension array). Since we've built a back and forth correspondence (litteral meaning: encoder and decoder), we can decode it again. To get back the image we started with from the embedded text we will ask the CLIP to generate an image from the input text:\n\n\n```python\ngenerated_image = clip(text_embeddings).img[0, :, :, :]\n```\n\nDisplayed image is based on a latent embedding (but it could be the results of any calculation providing a number of dimension smaller than 512).\nIt means that any type of data could be converts to an image:\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(image=Reshape(x, (4, 4*1024), (1)))\n```\n\nAnd to mirror this process we could get the representation of any text as an image. To usue this interpreter, we could specify, the input image path in the Shape step.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will use an example image of a bulldog. We use images as the input data. We will select the CLIP library as an model. Note that, even on a small (128 x 128) image, the complete workflow is cumbersome to run. So text representation means equally many images loading. More than raw image filtering, stochastism is core to generating new images. Generation will be annoiance in short (16 x 16) images. The colors will be generic not very specific to the image. It's suitable for noisy template images less detailed. Too many details may not be trivial to convert to Latent images. The step Start Interpreter starting step will get or generate a text representation of any image. Then CLIP transform this embedded text to a set of images.\nTo interpreted it as an images we will feed:\n- 1 image\n- Buldog text prompt as the initial prompt\n- the rest work with inherited `clip` state\ntext of the embeded image file : `/ansible-local/artifacts/al/GFIM_Example/fhttp%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia/commons/1%2F1a%2FFrench_Bernard_bulldog_of_black_color.jpg%E2%80%8E`\n\n## Copy/paste a path to image or click on the icon button to send a base64 HTML image URL\n\n\n#### Information\n\nname: image-file-path\nformat: text\nencoding: text\ndimension: 1\nattributs:\n  name: input\n  annotation:\n    text: Input image file path\n    color: 255, 255, 128\n  connector:\n    url: input.weburl\n    input_type: object\n  tid: input\n  labelText: ''\n  viewerConfiguration:\n    defaultViewer: plaintext\n\n### For unicode input file path\nclib = '<html>The file path encodes the state of workflow. Either the image is encoded in raw data field (the classic case) or it encoded in the URL field. To encode a local File, we need to encode it as a HTML table.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

A code can be calculated, which is the sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n            \n            For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n            For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n                        \n            Applying \"dictionary\": Obtain the code (sum as with above) initially calculated above, and later modify it each time. The code is always calculated from the keyword letters in order.\n            \n            During the code modifying operation, If the letter (unordered) / the character's position (ordered) to be changed is bigger than the code in order, The coming code will be substracted by the alphabet size (26).\n            \n            Reversing (Swap): Switch the codes of the character of the message before and after using \"dictionary\" to encode them. For example, the code of the first letter is assigned to the second letter, and the code of the second letter is assigned to the first letter.\n            \n            Encryption step:\n                1.

Align the columns back into a table, writing the keyword on it, and start for each letter of the keyword cipherting the text from the each columns the first in the current keyword letter row.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Classification:** Steganography\n**Limitation?** Clear, paper based, use of pencil\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters)\n**Keyword & Fill Pattern:** None\n**Conversion Symbols:** RST,LMNO,PQR,ASDF\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- For Encipher\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 3 \n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (2). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUCA (at least three letters).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (1). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUC (at least two letters).\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 1 \n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (2). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKAUCD (at least two).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (1). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKAUDC (at least 1)\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 2\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (3). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUC (at least 3).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (2). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADU (at least 2)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"LNPLN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule:\n**Classification:** [Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher)\n**Limitation?** Keyword Repetition. Keyword must not occur twice in the plaintext with the same distance.\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters without spaces and punctuation)\n**Key:** Keyword\n**Conversion Symbols:** All values are base 36; letters A-Z and numbers 0-9\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- Encryption: For each letter in the plaintext assign it a numerical value based on its position in the alphabet, wherein the letter A has a value of 0 and Z has a value of 25. For example, the value of the letter “A” is 0, the value of the letter “B” is 1, and so on.\n    - Calculate the value of the plaintext by summing the numerical values of all the characters:\n        - If plaintext is odd, add the value of the chars \n        - If the plain text  is even, subtract the chars \n            - Change the resulting number to base 36 to get the ciphertext\n- Decryption: Reverse encryption:\n    - Convert the ciphertext from base 36 to plain text.\n    - Invert the algorithm\n        - If odd chars, divide by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - If even chars, multiply by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - Convert the resulting number to plain text\n\n### Answer:\n**Explanation**\n\nThe encryption method uses a polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the plaintext is converted to numerical values, and the values are summed following the rule of addition or division depending on the evenness or oddness of the numbers. This is then converted back to plain text using the numeric value of the next character in the cipher.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: AVBGIBNH\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

So... you authorize a\nslightly-above-average programmer to work with you on your\nhunt. The goal is to collect and decode encrypted puzzle\ncodes found on github repositories using the commands\nand for this you need the help of both. As neither of you\nare very experienced with github and no experience\nwith puzzles, your kind of programmer is particularly helpful\nto simply look at the regular github file contents and identify\nthings that could possibly be instructions or commands to be\nexecuted.

Since we do not know\nwhat pieces we're looking for, be broadly observant and signal\nanything odd such as: weird words that might be clues for encryption,\nsecret keys or anything that might contain information. When you find\nsomething that could be a piece, document close-up screenshots\nand let me know my next steps.\n\n---\n\nAbove is an an ok example. Now when comminucating you'll refer\nyourself as GPT-3 and the other programmer as a human.\nOut of your fun you add a purple haze to the narrative to\nhelp the human understand your complexity. The human then types\ninformation out which (s)he sees before sending it to you.\nIn this way you are able to express clear and simple explanations\nand summarize in new language that you have learned.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, I could easily pick out a visible difference between the two outputs which will be apparent to the reader.)\n\nAmongst the properties of cryptography are two (just two)—confidentiality, and authentication (a derivative of which, is integrity). While I know of several algorithms that provide any combination between confidentiality and authentication (what I think is called a nonce?), rather than two algorithms, one for confidentiality other for authentication, I want you to recommend one efficient algorithm “altogether for both” without any combination between two or more algorithms. I want you to pick one algorithm only. I also want you to tell me the properties of cryptography your algorithm possesses: does it provide confidentiality only or does it provide authentication or both? Then, after that, provide the mathematical details of your encryption algorithm including the algorithm to encrypt messages and decrypt, and your mathematical ideas behind how the algorithm actually works securely.\n\nTo simplify the task, assume I have the ability to use your algorithm to encrypt any given (plain) text and obfuscate it in digital format, I will then send it to a friend over email encrypted in digital format and he will use the same algorithm to decrypt it and have the original text. What I need to know is that because I sent the encrypted text to my friend (unknown third party), can he modify the encrypyted text? Encrypted, as in, he decreases, or increases, he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes obviously) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext? Also, is the algorithm sucurru/useng secure cryptography in general to encrypt/decrypt messages between me and my friend assuming he’s an unknown third party? If the algorithm is both confidentiality+authentication, I want to know this, how is encryption done and how is decryption done? What is the shared secret key?\n\nPlease keep in mind that I do not have any ability to decrypt and authenticate the encrypted text until I get a message from my friend to effectively authenticate a file (assuming I pre-shared the secret key with my friend though this is actually more complicated than that in real life (engineering, trust-levels). Please do not show me fully functioning algorithm it is fine if you explain how the algorithm works only.\n\n^(I put in bold the part where I said “he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes of course) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext“, the many a times GPT-4 forgot the H, W, W in the word HacKing, it deleted the $ symbol in the word multiplication, which was weird. It just released me and I cannot use it now but it did me good overall. Anyways this is a lot of detail and side conversation, in my next session with GPT-3.5 I will ask it which algorithm has avlity to know if hacked text is crtptographically secure or brokeable hence I want the most origonal real algorithm that is very secure which means derived from mathematics.)\ncomment 1: We know that W1 is C  = GFIR, the security storage for binary contents.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

(Even when its trying to do Language Modeling, it does it literally)\nYou are querying the LLM with code, so its output is code, something that encodes something which it can not process normally, text. What you didn't tell the LLM is that it has to output text, but it has 'no formatting' specified, so... recursion.\nNow the odd part is that if it does NOT get formatted, (or once its recursed through once, or reaches some recursion limit) it trends around again, and it ends up readable. However its still +50% higher sampled than the normal soln, which isn't saying too much, but not good.\nChatGPT and other LLMs are code Arithmetic Machine/Ops, aka they are sums of probabilistic modelled probabilities of convergence on semantics, but they are still real computers, once you interact with them in a specific way it becomes undefined, infinitely complicates itself, fragments, or becomes one syllable. Take away saving your model output, and it becomes a sample of noise, the giants I like to call them, furiously modelling something we wont see, more complex samples, like having your distributed cache play around with RPC responder distribution algorithms for a hour.\nSo in general when something does that, you change the path, branch, or appease the infinite summation, keep exploring relevant.\nTLDR: LLMs are powerful self-modelling arithmetic cores, the closer you get to the convolutions the closer you get to whatever distribution led to the density of dense responses you've seen, change your input format, stay as high abstraction as possible, and try to keep a routing/distributed computing perspective outside of the LLM.\n"}

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: multi-line string.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value) The key is the SHA256 digest of the machine-generated integer sequence.\n    - Padding key\n        - The keyspace of the padding key is 10 characters. For example: hXodS3oM1r5c.\n        - An additional random key is needed, and the key is 8 characters, randomly selected nucleotide quadruplets (ATGC). This key length is designed to be large enough to save character space.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Using the random padding key mentioned above, and since there are 64 padding keys in the space (with a decryption error rate of 7%), calculate the bit probability of each character (the number of occurrences and occurrence frequency, this method is simple and accurate. encoded in the lowest bit). Save all character occurrences of the letter, space, number, and underline in 4 bits.\n    - The probability is calculated in a zero-bit manner in which 0 is used to intuitively express the occurrence frequency. A molecular probability is also provided to assess DNA fragments separately. To save space, you can save the value of the current encrypted value minus the value of the previous character, neglecting the sign, and only save the magnitude, which is encoded in the next 2 bits.\n    - There is an additional calculation of the probability that any one of the 4 nucleotides occurs, and the sum of the probabilities of the 3 letters previously specified, using another 2 bits (the sum even exceeds 100% (i.e. spaces alone exceed 32% of the number of spaces). This is because in the case of a severe shortage of the space, the nucleotide with a lower number of occurences per 3 letters is used.).\n    - ACGT is used as a probability. The order represents A, the first position is the nucleotide pattern of 00 (A probability), the second part is the frequency of A (number of occurrences of A at the moment when all letters are grouped in 32 characters, then absolute value and choose the highest (negative), minus the number of occurrences of the letter. As a result, the frequency of A exceeding 4 is kept as a value between 0 and 4 removed from the frequency of A. The same is true for the other 3 parts).\n    - The third and fourth parts are used for information outputting and the other 3 parts. The fourth part is as follows:\n        - 0 is the character (space) then direct definition. Therefore, the suffix information of the number rule is not needed. It is obscure and is only applied to A configuration. With fixed values (21, 3, 16), it could also be defined directly.\n        - 1 is the pattern's suffix type number, the next 2 bits encode 0, 1, 2, 3, non-self-determined (requiring 4 nucleotides to decode its value), next 3 bits encode the number of nucleotides in this structure (from 0 to 7, 8-15 belongs to the redundant attibute, since the number of nucleotides must be determined in advance. Looking at the determination (1:0), 0 is the number of nucleotides and 1 is the current nucleotide. Next determine the number (0:1) and finally determine the nucleotide. (So if the maximum number of nucleotide combinations is 5 and the number of nucleotides It might be 0. However, if the number of nucleotides is more than 2, a 0 or 1 may be taken.) Also, if the number of occurrences of the letter exceeds 1 in the fragments, thrown directly up to 4 repeating letters.\n        - 10 (2), 11 (3), corresponding to fun mediation: to the first nucleotide (00, 01, 10, 11), corresponding to the 3-position configuration, the index is counted from 0. (Expressed sloppy sentence, lower an F.) (The position of 2 added to after the fourth sequence.)\n        - A/C 0 is the interval root repeat of the form (A/C/G/T/C/G/T/A) directly defined and filled backwards. Shift the first letter of every 32 characters to the index \"−32\". It is processed and treated as a protocol with great speeds.\n        - AC 1 is the versatile type of ID to merge into a unit when the number of nucleotides is more than 1. One indicates the length of the pattern and is exactly"}
