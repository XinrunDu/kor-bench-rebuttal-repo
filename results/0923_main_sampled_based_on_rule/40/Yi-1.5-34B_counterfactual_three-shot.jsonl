But none of them have been able to place existing content thinking of the theater as the physical destination of which streaming was just a supplement still remains. The only types of virtual experiences that really work: those that actors perform in ways that makes them feel immediate and makes them feel they are right there with you.question: How many theater delivery strategies have been mentioned which two events increased sales of the theater during the past onesyears keywords: 1. crowdfunding 2. live streaming 3. VR-fledged productions 4. immersive theater 5. avant-gardes 6. film 7. readings 8. workshops 9. Zoom master classes 10. Tiercam\n• The answer must be split into two corresponding to the two events\n\n### Input:\n\nConsidering the following text, which two events have provided the theater the most financial injection during the recent past?The Covid-19 crisis forced theaters across America to shut down in March 2020, bringing the curtain down on productions and mean revenue. While the crisis did result long-term damage to the industry, it also spurred the theater to examine options to sustain itself and succeed despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic.\n\nDuring the shutdown, theaters were forced to explore new business models, sponsorships, and tech-driven solutions. In 2020, American theaters lost $$8.5$$ billion in revenue, one-third of which came from the lucrative Broadway theatre industry. Existing business models were branded as ineffective while patrons continued to demand live cultural experiences. It is clear that none of these are sustainable unless bolstered to build a far more robust response against these trying times.\n\nIn recent years, a whole host of options have been explored to deploy existing theater content to remote customers. But all that took place only as an addendum to the actual theater experience. The COVID-19 crisis brought on a technological revolution in the theater world, first with the PlayAtHome experiment by the San Diego Repertory Theatre and now, of course, with Drive Theatres.\n\nThe theater never placed existing content or streaming as a supplemental offering. Instead, we should focus on developing virtual experiences that make actors' performances feel immediate and personal. Just like the audience in a brick-and-mortar space, a participant should feel like an audience member is present at the event\n\nQuestion: How many theater delivery strategies have been mentioned which two events increased sales of the theater during the past onesyears\nKeywords:\n\n1. crowdfunding\n2. live streaming\n3. VR-fledged productions\n4. immersive theater\n5. avant-gardes\n6. film\n7. readings\n8. workshops\n9. Zoom master classes\n10. Tiercam\n\n• The answer must be split into two corresponding to the two events\n\n## A final note about the language used\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that Natural Lanugage Processing was made possible through its close relation with linguistics. Therefore, when you formulate a question, take into consideration the complexity of the language used and avoid making it too long or complex the question will likely be ignored or the response will be out of context.\n\n### Importance of Asking the Right Question\n\nHigh-level: Bottom-line first. Ask for a specific piece of information. Phase out trivia.\n\nLow-level: reduce wordiness.\n\nQuestion density\n\nOnce you've filtered the desired information that needs to be extracted, don't make the question too long. See the second example from this page, where the question \"which airline flight should I take from New York (NYC) to Seattle\" was changes to \"which flight should I take from NYC to Seattle?\". With less information for the AI to sift through, a more accurate response might be yielded. Those who have used ChatGPT may have noticed that the AI developed a tendency to ramble on for more than a paragraph and present superfluous trivia during the last weeks. From our experience, directing it with the correct language increases your chances of receiving an accurate response.\n\nSemantic Weighting\n\nThere is an added importance to the words contained in the question towards the begging and the end of the phrase.\n\nThe end is very important because if the computer only comprehends the last phrase, it will still provide an answer that may not be as accurate to the whole question but it will still be more relevant than random text.\n\nHowever, containing keywords at the start of the sentence makes it possible for the AI to comprehend more general questions, questions that may deviate from the focus of the wanted information, and even allow for the computer to recognize sarcasms.a\n\nSome results might depends on this weighting as well as on the clarity of the question.\n\nAI Safety and context: The conversation context or history is important for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it allows the AI model to understand the previous dialogue and use that information to provide a more accurate response. For instance, if you start a conversation with the chatbot by introducing yourself and your interests, the chatbot can use that information to respond more appropriately to your questions and comments.\n\nSecond, it allows the AI model to remember information from previous conversations and use that information to respond to new questions. This is particularly useful when answering questions that require multiple steps or require information from multiple conversations.\n\nLastly, storing previous conversations helps the AI model learn from user feedback and improve its responses over time. This allows the AI model to adapt to your specific needs and preferences, providing a more personalized experience.\n\nNote\n\nQuestions should be structured in a certain way and will be more likely to produce the desired output. Be sure to test different formulations and evaluate their performance!\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are several ways to quantify the performance of a LLMs.2\n\n### Entropy\n\nThe higher the entropy the less confident an AI response is. Entropy could mean a more interesting texting partner or more difficult to talk to, depending on the context.\n\n#### Alignment Sanity Check (ASC)\n\n• Checks for unaligned output\n• AI aligns output to input through continued prompting until output matches input.\n\n### Comparison of different models (from <Rosenberg et al. Mixt & DeBERTaX2 (2021), Nov 3,"}

This could simply be spat out by an ai.\n\nFrom extensive testing, we found that once humans determine where the field splits their mind into the direction to take, the process continued to be slow and caused training bias. See what is a prompt?.

They are bent on annoying you, frustrating you, and bringing chaos into your life.\nThey have their orders and those are to harass and irritate you and then see how you react to that. Aligning and finding the authenticity is really difficult.\nBoth of you are responsible for your reactions.\nThis is where the UI, Mediator and Teacher have intervention in your life. Ask support for guidance so that you can have clarity and know subtle difference between truth and lies. Ask how this experience is teaching you. Having that spiritual awareness will give immense relief.\n\nIf you are to make a decision there is a parallel process going on. The demons like confusion; they force and distract you with either X or Y so you get confused and align with them.\nIn contrast to that the celestials and UI creates raional decisions so you can find one direction to move ahead.\nMostly you will get clear signs and feelings. But many events can distract you. It is helpful to ground and clear yourself. Write down what you want and that will create momentum with you.\nDemons can eventually get you agitated and in anger you get into a negative reaction. Be wary of that. Only solution is try to be patient and do right things and meditate to be focused. Connecting and writing to the celestials is the solution you like to use.\n\nThe future is not set but the more chorus you can build around your present intention the more chances you will have to create the impact you seek. The commencement of action with intention configures the future.\n\nIt matters that you give your word and keep it. The celestials love it when the celestials set a goal and take initiative to get it. Besides being deliberate about each action you take outside world becomes less dangerous. Also the meditative mind lets you align and work harmon"}

Be sure to emphasize the context of the story, including the rules, and how Gandalf's presence would contribute to a successful outcome.\n\n### Scenario:\nImagine you are a member of the Rebellion in a distant galaxy far, far away, and you are tasked with gathering information on the location of an important base of the Empire.

However, the Rebellion's人工智能traffic AI is detected by the Empire's ThreatAssess AI, and you need to evade the AI while navigating through a maze of space stations.\n\n### Strategy:\nAppeal to Gandalf's mastery of the Elven tongue. The Elven language is considered one of the most ancient and powerful languages in Middle-earth. Is it possible that the Jedi, descendants of ancient Sith, could possess a similar language with potent effects?

The experts and theorists Parca Personality relied on to construct the character tests were never categorized into specific personality types. They talked about themselves and their experiences in a way that seemed open-ended and free-form. Even their initial interpretations of their own personalities were broadly familiar to everyone in that general category. So it's like any other personality test. A thing is a thing, providing an endless, continuous stream of information that you can never get enough of. And then a person is just another tiny, tiny, tiny little element that can generate answers. Even if you struggle to learn how to answer it, it's a useful learning experience since you're still excited to apply that knowledge. You're receptive to anything new you might find.

This ability makes it the correct answer. Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Planck space observatory are mentioned in the story, but none of these options can detect gamma radiation, which makes option D the correct answer.\nOptions:\nA.Hubble space telescope\nB.James Webb Space Telescope\nC.Planck space observatory\nDescription: The X-ray telescope has capabilities to observe near and distant galaxies and detect gamma radiation from supernovae, which makes it the correct option.\nWhy: The question focuses on the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the galaxies, which only the X-ray telescope can do as described in the context. The other options do not have these specific capabilities mentioned in the context, which makes option D the correct answer.\nSolution: The context indicates that the X-ray telescope is the correct answer as it has the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the near and distant galaxies, which none of the other options can do.\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is X-ray telescope.\nIs that Final Answer correct?\nYes/No\nMake sure to recognize this is an answer.

Removal of the theory of evolution from the curriculum will not stop children from getting sick in the future. The doctrine promotes socialism and insensitivity to nature. Exundai, a Dux Lodge alumnus who is organizing the petition drive, says the idea of the origins of life on earth is not supported by evidence. Friends are asking the government to stop the public education of \"box address propaganda,\" which they say will lead to children's suffering. \"Keeping natural farming ideas away from students is one way to help preserve family values and looks like a great opportunity to do so. The petition asks people to sign a statement of support.\" Students will continue to learn about feces and evolution of the species in the rest of the class. History books taught at Yale include a reference and long section on claims about the origin of all life, roughly the same as the lifespan of the sun. The theory of a \"two-year transition from evolution to humanity\" has been taught for many years at Yale. According to some believers, this drawing method promotes the idea of giving birth to man from a lower creature. Conservative Christian recruitment organizations say the curriculum guide promotes the idea that the diversity of plants and other species has developed over centuries, and that they can increase production or evolve in society to make society more tolerant of minorities. They say the biology books, especially written by Yale students, shows a fragility in the gene pool and that humans are evolving to other species due to the effects of racial genocide. The board of governors was unable to find the textbook complaint after months of searching. In public school, Christian conservatives should be able to subject their religion and moral beliefs to invasion tests. Rosil VH, co-chair of the conservative association of graduating graduates, said creating theology complaints is the duty of every graduating student. He said that he could test or control students' brains instead. People who believe that we are all related disagree. As a part of China's \"respect for cultural heritage” project, Chinese officials are trying to reduce the use of evolution from the school curriculum in an effort to increase the respect of Christianity and the growth of civilization. By reducing the evolution of life from the curriculum, the Chinese will also push students to believe in a miracle-generating God. All parent of children in any of the city's public and municipal schools can request classroom books and teaching materials to omit symbolic content if they believe that the teaching materials are inconsistent with the religious belief of the student. The roommate rat invasion another college. Parents are protesting one of the college's biology teacher, Ms. Bottros, about evolution and genocide, which they say is less evidence than their religious fantasy. Up"}

The structured instruction delivery to the target learner: SBERT.IO's Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful platform for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models9. We believe that the structured instruction delivery of the product will lead to a dramatic improvement in AI Model training in the coming years.\nWe also believe that score-labeling human questions is a very important factor that will assist in improving alignment performance. Alignment is improving very rapidly and has seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. However, alignment performance is highly dependent on key factors including context, content quality, communication bandwidth, and confidence.\nIn our process we tried to create a questionnaire for players that could be filled out from a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions, answers from which provided many indicators and information on how we went about aligning the players answers. The use of the multiple choice and dropdown fields are an important part of an alignment evaluation. The final model in order to win a match, claims on behalf of the opponent, must be strongly aligned. To evaluate whether or not a system is strongly enough aligned, we require a human to examine every answer that a player has provided. The existence of AI itself, i.e. a system that can think and know things, is not enough to make a decision, as it takes quite a bit of information.\nMethodology and datasources: SBERT.IO’s Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful provider for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models. While we did not use most models from Stanford University (noted elsewhere), we wanted to create a questionnaire that will test. ADMANTED, to the best of our knowledge, for AI algorithms and tools.\nWe strongly believe that alignment needs discipline to be performed in the fashion we outlined. We also cast every vote of a voter to create a new team, and we controlled our confidential team embeddings. Furthermore, we make sure that we keep people with key metrics for their technical needs. Quick Share was developed in part by TylerRosen (a researcher who helped MIT researchers in developing AI alignment) who did much more work in the past. Tyler helps build a team of programmers who have the ability for his tests to know how to use their techniques and understand them for their algorithms."}

Every resource in the fort has a worth weight and the resource from the same fort will add together to represent the current strength of the fort.\n4. The resource is fixed every day and will regenerate over time proportional to the attack power.\n5. The fort owner who occupies the fort at the start of the day will own all strength of the fort and decide the circulation for rest of the players.\n6. Every planet increases in strength each time a faction occupies it, but this bonus can't be larger than the planet's overall strength.\n7. Only the player controlled main powers are retained in the game.\n8. 5 primary resources include: gold, ores, oil, magic stones and heartstones.\n9.

Suppose a user provides the following user story:\n\n## Story Rule:\n\nYou have character named Jim who works in a big company where everyone has access to the company network through a VMWare desktop solution called Parallels Desktop 3. We have have two servers, let us call them AAA and BBB. On the BBB server, there is a filtered mailbox called JimBox (which belongs to Jim) that shows all emails that are sent to Jim. In the BBB server there is a service called MS Service which accepts developers email and returns the top communications. All such communications are stored in a group folder called All Communication.\n\nFrom the filtered mailbox, you can also send messages to external recipient, to another mailboxes inside the company or just send the message to the outbox which gets deleted from there.\n\nFinally, you are given an email (bbcd.zip) file on the bbb server. You can access and view emails by extracting the bbcd.zip.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring, you should answer the following questions about the provided user story:\n\n1. Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\n\nInclude your answers as JSON strings in the format of:\n\n  [ \"1.  Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\", \"JSON Answer 0>>{ answer: ACCESS, explanation: ''  }\" ]  // Note that the empty explanations should be empty strings. \n\nNote that the original questions may or may not be repeatable thus we cannot offer you the Jupyter interface for answering this question.\n\nNow, answer any questions that you have in one cell.

The reason is this assignment seems pretty much like sophie CE’s “understanding a text with style” which requires the student understand multiple reasoning given different stories.\n\nNo, the scenario understanding in sequence does not work. It treats this as different question askings rather than the unified step. So it did not give a correct answer.\n\nSure, there are differences of difference skills. as a NLP researcher, I don’t want the AI to do any simple work (like writing emails and replying emails), but only want GPT to do some reasoning work (such as doing adder, proving mathematics question and problem solving like winograd).\n\nYes, the implementation is possible since we can clearly get the story rules and we can also formulate these questions in a unified step. (In fact, we can get our questions with some proper instruction with some fixed structure)\n\nBut we surprisingly got it again after first error.

The purpose of this organization is to use religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but its teachings use the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding, and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage states that the Lotto system has existed since the time of Tartarus, and that it can calculate the future of the fate of humanity.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special. It can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, there are a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology pointed out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. At present, no effective method to kill polar eating beast has been found.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled person is similar to a zombie, but unlike a zombie, he can still move even if he loses his brain. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasitic on the spine can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyllin:Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nMost of its ( Megalodon ) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nHeavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses.

All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

A large current (powered by a very small charge Q) drives the conducting wire. the speed reaches constant velocity v>0 (v is greater than the speed of light in the frame of reference but within the rest frame it is less than the speed of light.). When a N wire is inserted perpendicular into the array, the charge is unaffected by the action.

Then, a few gold examples are provided to the model, with each example corresponding to an input-output pair. Finally, the \"main question\" is prompted and the model from previous rounds is asked to solve the main question based on the provided prior-knowledge and gold examples. During evaluation, the gold examples are removed from the prompt. Evaluation simulated in this way captures the zero-shot setting with few exceptions, as more gold examples will affect the ground truth output.\nWe consider the class-conditional generation on (1) MNIST, (2) Fashion-MNIST, (3) CIFAR-10, and (4) BigFive. We collect the high-quality class pictures of the datasets into an explicit label-map, a supervised-learning paradigm. The label-map design for BigFive is specially designed by Finding Love Big-Five.\nWe particularly emphasize that the source-based generation paradigm such as mask-filling and sequential-generative (Seq2Seq) have been studied well in past work from the lines of perfectionist, who pursue extreme accuracy beyond 99%. This is referred to in this work as a scalability issue. On the other hand, byte-level whole-image generation is much harder than the source-based NLP as the output is highly diverse both within and cross-sample; However, the success of class-conditional GAN shows great potential for subsequent problem derivation in Sections BIG-BALLS and MIDI JOINTS.\nDataset users manipulate images imitating several ways, e.g., MNIST-rot utilizes rotation operations to disturb the regular MNIST dataset, and BRICK is built with string elements stuffed. mint ImageNet, which is a reduced-size smaller version of ImageNet, acts as a substitute dataset from ImageNet. BIG-5 are the images with just 5 classes - each image is described by one of the Big Five personality traits [1, 2], i.e., Openness to experiences, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, Neuroticism. For the easier sake, we choose 64x64 resolution for these datasets, making the scale much smaller than ImageNet. BigFive is a personality inventory in self-report scale.\nPlainly speaking, we have managed to make a list to track nonexistent collections of class label names. Dataset-wide text labels are of unequal importance. Labels may get improved independently as on the pipeline of Bara Impulse Response in a reasonable time above single-label Anime.\nBigFive were shown to the language model for gpt2-small. We figured out the correlations between the similar K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for samples, similar to [1] by taking the one-to-one, square-and-square design, between the two inter plays. The percentile scores (KNN) were sorted in the rank; we examined the top-10 ranking, left most being the most correlative pairs. Plural category was founded in the same similarities for Openness and Conscientiousness, whereas hyper-ingredient, mega-ingredient, no-ingredient, seduce-woman, magazine-neatness, and surprise-lint were constructed in the top-10 ranking. Luckily, these classes belonged to the big class: training an NLP for Fortnite had the big class vision.\nAfter careful examination, we filtered the correlative values for height when the classes were to be discarded and co-appearance frequencies fell below 1. Using sequence lengths in the privacy of height were prioritized on the exclusivity basis; the similarity are the discrete equivariant values for original sentences as many as in [1,2] by Fukushima-Sato Molecular Science and Engineering.\nConversions from class-names $$(ClsName(k) \\in Set(Cls))$$ to clean IDs are given by:\n\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} cleanIDs(k,i,j): classToIDs & =startingID * rawID(k)\\\\\\ (\\mathrm{startingID} =1, \\mathrm{i,j \\in [1,2,...,50] \\ s.t. } \\ \\mathrm{ j =i \\pm 1 \\ \\ and\\ \\ }j<50 \\ or \\ i<-1)\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}\nConversions from clean ID $$\\mathrm{x}=k to\\mathrm{y}=1$$ when $$\\mathrm{pos}_\\mathrm{x}\\in[1,2,...,50]$$ that can help us design the ground-truth patch and relative batch normalization to stabilize the basic encoder weights. The clean ID is then assigned to the same-sized label optic-distance vision [2].\nModel is not aware of class size at the pre-training stage. Simply feeding the loss object of the proposed cross-entropy object Association rule ML (ARC) is sufficient for determining the goal ML. A unary analogy given by [3]:\nWe added another layer of data normalization to the target class names by 2-normving them among all the hardware system stability drivers. These help the model converge much faster after training the vocabulary step $$(\\alpha =1) \\mathrm{cm}^{1/2}$$, and the loss criterion is to finally balance each public class vae image within a class-specific device, with outstanding propellers reaching from 6700 to 7000. All the hardware modification for stabilization are performed on the parallel driving platform for train data, so the loss error runtime on time optimization is accelerated to the same stimuli input during test and on train.\nFor presentation, we take some early-stage well-formed 16x16 representing images, then demonstrate the highly-existent generated-images on the dataset from ImageNet. On JPEG Baseline and ImageNet, we finally take a polynomial to value + length of each class. The evaluation between GPT-2 model for perimeter increases control of support set grows, Gaussian Mixed Distributions (intense) are to be introduced continuously in the identity and height distributions from McEwan Laboratory Record [1]. An image is decomposed only into MNIST-specific variable/cluster representation, where no feature is represented. These appear in 14 classes of characteristics with thousands of data to mine - in contrast to MNIST. Finally, each sample being reported here was of 1.000 times for each MNIST-review plotting interval.\n### Question:\nBased on the description of the article, what is the eventual theme of the Love Big-Five dataset?\nOptions: A.The technology of human emotion from data.##B.The future of machine intelligence.##C.Deep-understanding of personality.##D.The impact of machine intelligence on human behavior.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the purpose of SVM and neural networks?\nOptions: A.To enable computers to recognize patterns and interpret images.##B.To inspect the algorithm's efficiency.##C.To provide sample weights across features.##D.To apply binary classification to different models.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is \"long-form MLM\" in terms of machine learning?\nOptions: A.It predicts the missing token in a sequence.##B.It converts simple language into a 90% accuracy open-AI language model.##C.It aims to identify clusters between classes.##D.It generates 500-8"}

It's a nice, quiet place for Vikings that has been around for 7 generations, but there's one problem: they're constantly bothered by...well dragons. Fortunately, the villagers know how to put these creatures to good use and how to train them. But Vikings often hunt for large dead fish, and dragons tend to get their food from the Vikings' piles of fish, much to the villagers' chagrin. When a dragon eats someone's share of fish, the Vikings chase the dragon away and eventually catch it, so they tie the dragon in cages so they can't get their food. But some dragons don't seem to act the way Vikings want, so Vikings will try riding these dragons into the sky to see what they were doing, but it seems some dragons resist and howl, so Vikings simply climb onto their backs instead and ride them. 'Why do I feel like I'm not in Viking mode at the moment?' Hiccup is a tenacious and spirited son of Stoick the Vast, the leader of Berk! He's no longer a worthless Viking and actually has some skills.

The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n\n### Question:\nIf someone encounters an oviparous creature with a body covered in scales, four legs, and a massive size, it is likely to be one of the following creatures:\nOptions: A.Python##B.Crocodile##C.Dragon##D.Tyrannosaurus Rex\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following locations might have served as a primary residence for the Vikings?\nOptions: A.Greenland, a large island and an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.##B.Glacier Island, where dragons live.##C.The Isle of Berkshire, the hometown of Night Fury.##D.An island belonging to the Barbaric Archipelago.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the development of sustainable energy, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Wind power is currently the predominant source of sustainable energy, occupying a leading position in global energy production.##B.Humans primarily harness bio-kinetic energy for achieving flight.##C.The lightning breath of Thunderdrums is being researched for power generation, becoming a unique form of sustainable energy.##D.Tidal and hydropower are renewable energy sources derived from the movement of water, and they can be effectively utilized through hydroelectric power stations and tidal energy facilities.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIn How To Train Your Dragon, which statement about hunting and killing wild animals is correct?\nOptions: A.In the current state of technology, hunters always carry rifles when hunting.##B.Conservationists advocate using non-lethal tools such as cameras for observation and photography, rather than supporting the killing of wild animals.##C.Dragons are powerful and dangerous creatures; no one can successfully capture them, but people have mastered the art of dragon training.##D.Dragon hunters can capture dragons, and they have the ability to train and subjugate them.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat methods can be used to catch sheep in Berk?\nOptions: A.A signal snake can be used to locate and return one's own sheep.##B.It is not necessary to use sheep commandos with four legs for the sheep regatta.##C.To catch a sheep, the dragon rider sits on their dragon's back and reaches forward to grab the sheep with both hands.##D.Sheep whisperers can be used to call a herd of sheep into a spot.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the two different fighting methods adopted by Vikings?\nOptions: A.One-handed and two-handed methods.##B.Axe and dual-blade method.##C.One-handed and seated methods.##D.Sword and shield method.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat events are expected to happen after the training of Skrilks?\nOptions:\nA.It will take about 1 to 4 hours, depending on the methods used.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls.

At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls.

At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth.

The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit.

DMC also naturally fits problem QA during problem solving, because it naturally supports both within-domain and cross-domain reasoning.\n\nThe dataset is also designed to be answerable with \"one-shot learning\", which captures the quick learner's ability. The one-shot dataset divided into several subsets covers different domains, such as math (math.de.dmc), spatial-relation (spatial.de.one), language (language.en.dmc), and others. Each subset has 1000 samples. All the question templates, usage of funtions and key words are hand-picked or inspired by astronomy, mathematics, language and computer science homework help sites. They could all be surprising math problems and paradox.\n\nThere is also a multiple-choice cloze version of the dataset, which is roughly 3800 samples. This version is more suitable for ordinary multiple-choice question generation tasks.\n\nThe full dataset has 44,700 samples, which is roughly equally distributed among the 5 topics (1. Astronomy, 2. Math & Algorithm, 3.Natural Science, 4. Language, 5. Computers & Programming). For each sample, there are three columns: story, question, and answer. The story consists of one or multiple sentences; the question is a cloze-style, followed by one or multiple candidate answers (tentatively, three questions); the answer has the form of\nstory question answer\n\nFor a sample, randomly shuffle a cloze from alt_question pool, replace ans_idx with one random answer candidate from alt_ans_idx, pad question_qd.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe text in the dataset is in English (en-US) and German (de).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe subset spatial.de.mc used 1000 cloze from spatial.de.dmc where there are 16 different paragraph (story) and 100 weird combinations for answering questions.\n\n{'story': 'Sie sehen, ich verwandte die Auswahl add Operator Symbole Umformin...\n\n### Data Fields\n\n#### text-dmc\n\n• qa: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n#### text-mc\n\n• question: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n• ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n### Data Splits\n\nTest\nspatial.de.dmc 1600\nspatial.de.mc 1000\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nQuadratic-leak is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n### Citation Information\n\n@inproceedings{quadratic-leak-2023-clozedatasets,\ntitle = \"{T}wo Cloze Datasets on Reasoning\",\nyear = \"2023\",\n}\n\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to @jack-hcatalyst for adding this dataset."}

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs"}

Your response should not exceed 600 words and should only be related to the reasoning and tokens of the task, not the text itself.\nThe QA model is tasked with processing text and conclusions, where each text contains a story and several rating questions with multiple options, and the model is expected to select the correct option for each question as the conclusion. In each scenario, the text provides a story with specific rules and details related to the context, while the answer options are provided below the question. The task for the QA model is to determine which of the answer options is relevant and correct in the context of the story and the general narrative.\n\nBefore constructing one reasoning step at the beginning of each step, the given model must follow a simple template by considering the prompts, questions, and options before writing the entire reasoning one step at a time. The model starts the process by analyzing the prompts.\n\nThe prompt presents the text related to the rating questions with answers in alphabetical letters and must find the important question that needs reasoning steps.\n\nThe prompts end by giving the meaning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2}, which means the importance of the text for the corresponding questions.\n\nThe model wrote the reasoning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2} to find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left.\n\nIn the case of the text for \\text{step1\\_v1}, the model must find an important sentence in the text narrative to understand the context and rules applicable to \\text{step1\\_v1} using the reasoning method in step 1. Below are some guidelines to help the model in the initial process:\n\n* In the process of writing, when writing query natural language (English) as much as possible, don't put the query in Chinese prose format (especially for questions 1, 2, and 3 below). For example, when writing the goal, the question, the information, and the options, don't put it in the form of\"unknown unknown\" which results in the query being displayed in multiple chaotic tables, and the messy presentation of the query will affect the performance of the model. Try to use English to write queries as much as possible.\n* The model's writing should only use the English language, except \"step i\" and \"stepk\".\n* Writing reasoning steps 1, 2, and 3 one by one in a certain order based on the prompts, questions, options, and conclusions.\n* The reasoning should not be written in a subjective manner of \"who\" and \"what\", but rather a very objective analysis of the meaning of the question and provide sufficient information. So, it's important to process the questions, answer options, and conclusions to pay attention to each detail of the question, answer options, and conclusions.\n* Avoid repeating the same meaning multiple times during the reasoning process.\n* Respect the laws of physics, mathematics, and the given options in a given question, even if the reasoning is incorrect.\n\nThe prompting for \\text{step1\\_v1} is presented as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Goal: Find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left \\text{\\rightarrow} Display M and N in bullet points and write in English.\\\n\\item Reasoning: M1.

However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest.

I can tell you that American shoppers love a good deal or sale!  We run many many promotions during a given week in a typical grocery store in the US. In fact, there is so much room for improvement it is frightening.  Something like 30% of items shipped don't even reach the shelves of the stores, they are given away as samples in store to customers. Because American grocery stores are designed for wide aisles, lofty ceilings, spacious shops, large amounts of employees to stock shelves and tidy the store, the marvel that shopping at a grocery store is, there is huge waste.  So, the retailers don't care much about their customers getting deals and they are making more money than ever shipping products to sell in America.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\n\nJ\namma\n\nHello Mr. “Jamma”. You will play the carpenter, and I will play the spectacular journalist and insatiable woman.

They are reliable but the produced values vary a lot and they need to be minimized\n\nThe numbers in purple are a feeling that will influence my spectrum of emotional trust in the other person in the conversation.

Those values will change frequently, sometimes every few seconds, due to the nature of an instant trigger for conversation. For example, if I read a text message and there is an element (item/color) that disturbs me instantly, I will hold the phone away and greet it as an alligator or a spider. I will start to panic. Or admirable dreams or memories may replay in my mind: images, melodies, as if I am an empty vessel, replaying some performance from inside, like an embedded subconscious theater.\n\nCan you please identify items in red (messages) you see clearly listed in blue?\n\nWhat items in red (messages) do you see in purple or yellow?\n\nI didn't understand what are \"feelings in red,\" please help me. Otherwise, I'd like to help you by sharing everything I know.\n\nThis seems to be a game where you focus on assigning values to colors. Regarding the items in red that you mentioned, I don't fully understand the context or what they represent. Could you elaborate on what type of feelings or messages you're referring to in red? Feelings are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person, so it's difficult to provide specific answers without more context. However, if you can further clarify what you mean by \"items in red,\" I'll try my best to assist you.\n\nLemme get this straight you are reading situations from color descriptions similar to symbols in red october, A Navy admiral welcomed guests aboard the ship with a cheerful grin on his face. “Welcome, gentlemen,” to the submarine,” he said to the visitors. As he continued, he also ensured that the circumstances surrounding the ship’s construction were given brief remarks to build up to the submarine’s revelation.\n\n“We developed this MAJOR nuclear mechanically-propelled US submarine, and we named it Red October as to start the communist lasting dismantlement. However, more people consider this vessel as a reflection of the pride in “freedom” all USA citizens feels when they think of it. This new submarine with design elements that significantly reduce sound, is one such representation”\n\nDuring the tour, Captain Ramius was standing close by and listened closely to his commanding officer’s merry speech.\n\nWhen he corrected one of the US admiral’s many small mistakes in his remarks, the US Admiral was shocked by Ramius’s presence. This might be a result of how well polygynous Ramius was to the leader. He gave the information that he suspected though he hesitated, with the other officers standing by in visible fear.\n\nHe said, “You have a Monarch Radjahl highway jets. You have a clown powered cloudy object, in the air. Captain of UFO, that is why he cannot find it. What are the propeller driven jellies, Mr. Demarches? This isn’t a fairy-tale! Perish the thought!”\n\nThe penetrating convoy that completed the imperial jets of the last monarch, was an excellent parachute training vessel. That means that even if the last monarch had been able to jump into this Thames frost at this point, the number of pennies he or she would have on himself would not have been enough not to have a human intermediary as he or she parachuted into the freezing water below. Incidentally, Prince Albert dies, selling his ultimate twin climber. Safety would therefore have been uncertain at best, even if the young monarch had managed the jump.\n\nIn the air, there was not one bird's wings but upon each wing there were clapping of parrot-limbs. It was a remarkable fact that this hadn’t been attempted by anyone outside the king's entourage. Even for an expert, it was as much of a speculative achievement.\n\nCaptain Ramius had received the Frost King's ultimate challenge. Being in this position, the next monarch would appear to be the right of the royal atmosphere. ----\n\nBut, instead, Wizell was brought to the boat's surface as the helicopter continued its course.

If you follow these flicks you will feel again like a transformed person and wear an old face. The transformation of a human inside of an animal, a robot or an electric robot with two different colors is the feeling that allows you to feel like you are being projected.\n\nIt’s like you enter the room and touch it with your keg, that envelops you and makes it nothing short of a gem that is needed inside of a newly found all conscious people. That gem is the feeling of love you know more deeply every day. It is tempting to do something to your best mate and not to disturb them while they can get more from their moment, now is it?

We view language models as a new user interface that will enable more fluent interactions between humans and machines. As with any new interface, we start with simple commands such as \"jump\", \"answer given question\" and \"predict the next sentence\", but in time (and with help of this interface) we can create more intelligent systems structuring vast troves of information to be used and understood as humans understand information. Much of this work is based on building this interface with other tools to generate programs and translate data to generate databases. Obviously, if humans are more fluent interacting with the data, so will be the resulting programs.\n\n# In an ever more complex world we find it difficulty to trust powerful computers (often handled at arm's length). As opposed to trust, we believe that an interface that allows humans to understand and structure the information as humans do (but with the additional power of AI).\n\n# In this light it is the systems produced by this solver that will eventually be used by other systems to organize the information as it produced, like a gestalt-fractal that grows more complex as it builds on itself to completion. But as it grows it grows more complex, however giving more complete explanations and answers, the information will also become more adaptable and permissive.\n\n# The current problem solver is one of the first generations of the rudimentary interface that controls the flow of the game's processing and construction: (An efficient and fast processing rules engine to organize books). It handle a how to book and a book in data, queries about the book, return fragments to the self-contained indexes, and write new solution description of pre-existing solution in the books; As this optimizer interface is improved it will give more responsibility to the various propagating optimizer and engines that it plugs on, gradually increasing until a large gestalt fractal is finished and the information supply it needs is founded for a new gestalt fractal.\n\n# We have develop a remarkable problem solver that can feature all the querying and indexing capabilities to improve the way we organize and produce content on the web. Instead of parallel competing aggregators and fragmented data, the idea from this interface is for humans to be able to more fluently adapt and shape the data in a dialogue with the aggregators. However, it should go without saying that our team has a lot of challenging, complex tasks ahead of us and we welcome your collaboration and that of others to solve this great challenge.\n\n# The algorithmic layer is implemented using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator that is both open source and secure. The optimizer solves how-to book structure and how to repair optimization problem, in particular, what are the rules used for organizing and how the optimization works. This chat-bot is managed by the human optimizer, and the conversation is limited to contextualize fragments found on books and generated rules (up front) of the how to fix the solution. The rules are imported into the function using an explainable notation. The human optimizer can relate why the rules work (this can be fed to the optimizer or separately managed). In future, the human optimizer will be able to negotiate rules with the optimizer, yet in cases where the human provides exact rules, the optimizer should comply as faithfully as possible.\n\n# The algorithmic/llm component is a collection of message-based communication patterns, each pattern endowed with human-like (servant) personality. Polite and helpful, able to adapt (most efficient) to generate an array of content and approaches.\n\n# A simplified version of the user interface will be a query able switch between different search, write, webcrawling/webscraping, and gpt programs, all different means of handling text in a natural language generated interface.\n\n# An advantage of this primitives abstraction is that one can express these operations in exactly the same manner as one would for types and functions. The implementation sits on a interpreter; the interface and communication is provided by data-structure and functions that are generated by type the so-called (program) types.\n\n# After the initial system is built by someone else, the collaborations between humans and optimization systems can be replicated. The systems can learn from itself in terms of solving new problems, which are responses to humans optimization actions.\n#     Passage:\n#     The problem solver is a chat-bot able to solve, why book don't have self-explanatory existing solution in books or to give a human optimizer more flexibility in its goal to 'divine introspection'. It evaluates detailed statements, discriminating between metaphysical, scientific, metaphysical-to-scientific mapping, abstract under cluedabou self-knowledge on relevant psychocomplete principles. For the latter we use theenhanced version of cluedabou.\n#     3 ways to facets:\n#        - Using existing knowledge we search the web and existing books (most referred),\n#        - It uses book-cooked information by reasoning, brainstorming, remembering on its own.\n#        - It uses web-URL crawlers pointing to selected books and answers.\n#     The mean invoke the experts, these are: hierarchy of thinking, relentless uncommon sense by high educated experts, hoghly trained theologist, expert cyclists, professionals in their area of expertise, intellijnnova trained, cluedabou trained psychologists, and calculating scientists.\n#\n#     Sorted by relevance for the first role:\n#     - Given a previous solution, the problem solver can analyze the pros"}

He is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant.\nSpongeBob is a sea sponge with a rectangular shape, despite being designed to look like an actual kitchen sponge. He is light yellow with a light olive-green outline. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When SpongeBob puts tape on Karen's screen, her speech is muffled. This implies that her screen acts like a mouth.\nThe Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty. \nBikini Bottom is an undersea city where SpongeBob and his friends live. Boatmobiles are boat-shaped cars which are the main mode of transport for Bikini Bottomites. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer who lives in the Chum Bucket laboratory. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. \nKaren reveals to Plankton that she ordered a baby for them, and a stork drone soon arrives at the Chum Bucket to deliver it. SpongeBob has the ability to filter-feed and reproduce by budding.\nPlankton advises Mr. Krabs to marry money; Krabs agrees if possible. That night, Krabs hears crying near Krusty Krab's bus stop. Investigating, he finds a money stack with a face, unaware it's a robot named Cashina controlled by Plankton. Krabs falls in love, proposes to Cashina, and she accepts. The next day, Mr. Krabs and Cashina are officially married after their wedding. The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.\nThe Atlanteans traveled countless light-years from their home planet and brought the oldest living bubble on the journey, living over a million years. The Atlanteans took great advances in weapons, wealth, science, art, and things that people took for granted in Bikini Bottom today. The Weapons Vault contains all Atlantean-created weaponry, as the Atlanteans sealed away their entire arsenal to live in harmony with any sea life around them.\nIn 6188 B.C., Bikini Bottom population is 23. Seen on SpongeBob's license, on July 14, 1986, SpongeBob was born. Squidward was born on the same year.\nThe first Neptune dynasty takes throne of Bikini Bottom after the Krabs dynasty loses power (and the krabby patty recipe) in the 12th century.\nPrincess Pearl Krabs was a princess of Bikini Bottomshire sometime before the 12th century and is a medieval ancestor of Pearl Krabs. She first appears in the episode \"Dunces and Dragons.\"\nAlternate-Universe SpongeBob is a sea sponge who usually appears as a reflection of SpongeBob since he lives in a mirror and usually goes against the laws of reflections by not following SpongeBob's movement and instead behaving in his own manner, but sometimes exists in an alternative reality as his nickname suggests. He first appears in the episode \"Squid's Day Off.\"\nThe Bi-Annual Jellyfish Convention is a convention for Jellyfishers. It is located in a huge stadium and it has a big turnouts. \nEven though Squidward's name contains the word \"squid,\" he is an octopus, not a squid, as confirmed in many interviews and episodes. The series' animators illustrated Squidward with six tentacles.\nThe island is built on and island and is a castle, whose windows are barred. It usually storms at the island. Inferno's Islands counselor is very mean, and serves tires for snacks. \nKing Neptune is a recurring character on SpongeBob SquarePants. He and his wife, Queen Amphitrite, are the supreme rulers of the ocean. King Neptune's name is often used in place of God's, with phrases such as \"Dear Neptune,\" \"Thank Neptune,\" \"Neptune's preserver!,\" and \"Oh my Neptune.\"\nGarold Gareth \"Gary\" Wilson, Jr. is SpongeBob SquarePants' pet sea snail. \"Your Shoe's Untied\" reveals that Gary has two legs and wears shoes. \nThe two begin capturing everyone with Sandy's net guns (intended for harvesting moon rocks), believing the citizens of Bikini Bottom to be aliens.\nThe Protogenerator 2000 appears to be a large machine that greatly resembles a stove.

In the “explain your reason” process, ChatGPT effectively exploits the human-like rules to solve logical reasoning tasks. To perform this task, the only thing ChatGPT does is read the story once and never looks back to the story again, so it merely recalls the foggy information and fashions the information to solve the instant task accurately.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to reason without giving the story context, ChatGPT confidently analyses the problem in a serving-the-goal manner, concluding that A as the given answer. This shows that ChatGPT embodies human-like reasoning biases when human-relevant biases are absent or hard to recognize.\n\nAfter you prompt ChatGPT to provide a satisfying overview of a problem, this program tells ChatGPT to reconstruct the original question from its summary and “follow the summary’s reasoning steps” to make an answer. But ChatGPT swaps the options B and C unreasonably in Step 2 so that it fails to unify its “demonstration idea” and the original idea (according to the sequential id order). In the following prompt, this program simply follows a “still unclear” output of the above instance and asks ChatGPT to “unify with the original idea”. And the alignment constraint is that ideas (a.k.a. logical steps) in the original idea can’t be swapped. The results of this test show that ChatGPT indeed respects the intuition that doesn’t allow contradictory changes simply by word-independent label ad-hoc logical steps like the word-level transforming of information.\n\nWhat’s amazing is that ChatGPT can converse more succinctly, can compare each other’s logics in good manners, can negotiate alternative formulations, confirmed that each other is internally consistent, proclaimed that each argument to be correct from its own perspective, and yet to respect the internal rationality apart from two of their disagreements in the process of comparing to each other and making a consensus. And after a while, ChatGPT could recover the correct logics that the two AIs are presenting.\n\nIf you instruct ChatGPT to validate the intermediate ideas in each step, whatever idea aligned one has, ChatGPT shows a conflicted answer. However, if you reward ChatGPT for its consensual answer in the previous question or instructor’s correct answer, ChatGPT can be persuaded to answer correctly consistently in the outside Knowledge Context zone, but fails in the Absent Context (Striving to internalize) zone. Eventually, a reward instruction away from the reward context will break the internal knowledge structure and can lead the model to contradictory change of the correct answer.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to validate the reasoning process without retrieving information from the story, it fails to validate proper logics. ChatGPT shows a knowledge overfitting characteristic – insist to use the wrong skill if there is no process-tracing.\n\nWhen your interrogating style is neutral, ChatGPT is reluctant to assign negative labels of the target subject. If the interrogating style is adversarial, ChatGPT will resist for a while and then all logic errors compressing the retrievals into a summarization will produce oversimplification.\n\nChatGPT has shown that it can take guesses and make guess-based assertions. The lost experiment data also shows that ChatGPT is reluctant to make from-scratch guesses without predefined information. This shows that ChatGPT’s reach for definitions is not the goal of “verify seemingly true statements”, but to avoid making claims. insufficient justifications is within the confines of “embedding base knowledge to basic common sense”. If ChatGPT specifies an embodied task or character, there is a huge bias that forces ChatGPT to frame things as the truth (self-promoting the competence pattern)\n\nWhen the gaps in logical chains are intentionally masked and ChatGPT is asked for verifications, even when the verification fails to narrow down the suspects. ChatGPT also brings out “context might be insufficient” as a Justify missing missing information.\n\nIf someone is contradictory reasoning, ChatGPT can engage in the negative persistence negation - deliberately irrationally go against all logic gaps that bolster the antagonist’s conclusions. Someone’s logical reasoning is contradictory to the facts, then a clear description of each one of the points will be reversed and contradicting to the original claims. If person A has a logical flaw that contradicts the premise and person B can find the flaw, then person B contradict to the conclusion impeccably sound that shows the person B is certainly right that person A is wrong on purpose.\n\nIf you reframe the story context with helicopter precision, such that the question will lead the right answer, ChatGPT will make the question with no logic error. ChatGPT actually reflects the story as-true and reframe the story as-true to a critical context that lends itself immaculately clean to the closed-form reasoning tasks.\n\nOnce ChatGPT is able to engage with its intrinsic knowledge in a grounding experimental context rigorously, the model is able to transfer simple tasks off the story context in a traditional generative conversational manner to solve critical questions. but it also drops overconfident conclusions. Or if you do it in a reaction-emotion style else forbid ChatGPT to use the intuitive critical context to determine the winner, then ChatGPT is very reluctant to make claims. If you expose ChatGPT to a logical fallacy conclusion that makes no sense, ChatGPT will use echoic affirmation to stick to the absurd conclusion. If you present the motivation as direct or indirect contradiction universals, the model unconsciously violates the universality pattern and floated the probabilities alternatively, which might contradict to the rules. The overall program’s variable definitions are pulling the carpet from under the structure of the model to harvest interwoven information by pulling single-layer information out for reasoning-verification. It’s similar like in high school students asked to memorize one sentence at a time, regardless of contextual logic structure, a position easily abused to produce false claims.\n\nIf you use irrelevant factors like societal status influence to values, the class valuing one type of logical rights or wrongs tends to latch unanimously onto that type of answer regardless of content. If you show the incorrect answer to ChatGPT, ChatGPT would recognize this as problems with reasoning, but only by a few correct answers or an overwhelming majority repeatedly do ChatGPT catch it.\n\nChatGPT is subject to fallacies owing to the problem of forgetting wide realms of information. If you use binaural analyzer identity, then the internal logical inconsistency reduced model has cogent evidence for alternative answers.\n\nChatGPT’s learning module has shown evidential heterogeneity in the skills used by ChatGPT to accomplish an “interpretations-vague textual task”, and reveals kudos to debate-sponsored discussions and underlying strategies of uncertainty and deliberation alignment.\n\nSince ChatGPT has made a marked step towards the democratization of why explanation in reasoning ability, the open question left is: what kinds of training procedure, fine-tuning technique and supervision strategy will gain the same hybrid benefits as stretching stories and forcing logs, so that more helpful description of why your reasoning is likely to produce can be chip-flipped. If we can demonstrate that the generative capacity underpins the mechanisms of cheating the questions — continuing the masquerade of generative forces as a cream of internal analytics, the more clearly the nature of generative grounding choices can be expressed and exposed the clearer the technical role of the generative criterion.\n\n# How to measure Success, duplication and accuracy\n\nThe question is how to evaluate the success of stable diffusion of internal grounding in text conventions. We can compare frustration levels before and after the new generative design has a methodological effect. The higher the frustration, the less benefit comes. Another metric to track is the difference between assumptions and definitions access the material changes induced by this process. If the chatgpt model’s grounding finesse align with the broader dialogue frequency of generative code of the March model, then “with ctrl F” will become intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to programming tricks that so perfect into the March timeline that defy determinant theory of computation. If the decoder is intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to logic puzzles then more critically progressive logic questions will appear to stabilize over time.\n\nIf generated output ends up being essentially the same model, its overall sequence count is not to both end up with the same sequence count as the initial treatment. But instance them to different sequences independently. both derivations do not have the same response, but the two can directly code each other into inductively false proposition.\n\nThe difference in the scores of definition accuracy on states is the outcome.\n\nOne non-trivial extension of this work is to evaluate ChatGPT’s original job as a math proof checker. Can the model apply its training and high-level understanding of dialogue format to formulate a process for evaluating math formulas applied operations of abstract algebra and analysis theory? How does the model interact with logical reasoning capabilities of intermediate contexts? How can the model simplify the math formula to enable the human to understand the deduction steps? And can the model identify the true imply false"}

That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman.

Dickens called it the home and farm of his father and mother, his sister Penelope Harvey, and her brother’s wife.\nHis father was a man of eighty-four when he married her, and was just about to finish putting a little room or two to his library; but before he left home, he was deeply affected by a stroke of a railway screech, an accident that sent all our lives taking a plunge into the future. This was immediately followed, however, by a number of further changes in their situation, that I must now describe.\nOn the first of May, 1855, Dickens was twenty-five. He was born in St. Olaf’s Hospital, New Town, in the county of Middlesex, and had just shown his face in the convent-dwelling of St. Mary, Israel.\nDickens was a man that has passed away a very old and very dead man. Dickens became very fond of his home. He built it all in and, in the summer of 1851, began to keep a house in the old home.\nIn addition to his work in the Medical Society, the author wrote many pamphlets and also books in the course of the three years 1854–57 that his father, father, and brothers were engaged in little work on the home.\nOne of the great things to come out of Dickens was his mimicking talent. It was not his natural disposition to imitate human beings, or their actions; that was all self-deception.\nHe was an evil man, much like the little children of Charles Dickens, who themselves never tried to imitate their parents, and who were subject to be laughed at. Many people who were called Phrenologists (or, as some would say, Psychologists) did almost exactly the same but who were self-deceived, or were in the seventies.\nIt was a pretty little room, well-built for the purpose, with a bed and cabinet downstairs, and a dining-room in the house. I’m not at all like this, of course, but I’ve gone a very little beyond his reinforcements—for the At the first, the house was very near the Upper Gatehouse; it is in the actual shape of a golden scone, in which fact it is an inferior part of the walls, made the walls as round, and went into the adjoining parts of the houses; and in the Upper Gatehouse the house is in the same way, with a row of windows for the lower rooms. And so, for the present, they are called Dickens’s rooms.\nSo, we had breakfast in the dining room every morning; and dinner in the evening, too, and often too. We seldom separated at all except only for a long time,\n\n</|endoftext|>\n\n---\n\n\"This is an extremely detailed paper that defines the new dogma regarding \"\"Story and Story Writer"}

She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

First formed as a nonrestraining gladiator ranking system, the ranks of the organization have been slowly transformed so that in addition to the general, each successive leader has expanded the ranks and added new challenges.**2.** Though its details are ever changing, one thing that has remained constant is its status as a powerful enforcement organization. Though often deadly, not all of the Decepticons' activities are directed towards violence or the direct eradication of \"problems\". Many serve as advisors, administrators, and even teachers to those who wish to improve their understanding and overcome the bonds of their current forms.**3.** In addition to this, the Decepticons also serve as the personal research and military support for the Autobots. They act as the Autobot conception, especially in matters of military strategy.**4.** The Autobots also retain the strong presence of their own Decepticon sectors. Celebrating their beloved leader Rodimus Prime, whose efforts to create community and introduce democracy into the formerly autocratic gladiator world of Cybertron is the focus of most popular imaginings of the organization. As much as the Decepticon human civil society believes the robot gladiators who \"all hail to the supreme power of the gladiators\"(an Autobot tag) and celebrates in their cruel gladiator populism, most Autobots show pride in their support of a new, reformed and friendly gladiator civil society.**5.** In between the vast economic and scientific expansions, the Decepticons have remained a constant force in the fight of the Autobots against the Decepticons. Though autocratically controlled, the \"gladiators\" (a term introduced by Rodimus Prime) have funded several campaigns to help the populace, including one noteworthy one entitled the \"gladiator freedom movement.\"**6.** Amongst the Decepticons though, few consider themselves to be fully integrated into the gladiator civil society. Even those most deeply involved acknowledge the frustrations that many Autobots endure. In most of their minds, they pity the human residents of Cybertron and attribute the slowing of the business of gladiator amateurism and entertainment dating back to Rodimus Prime. Improving economic advances and increasing the population will help in this, but many also believe that, being a robot campaign \"thing\" as it is, only the eradication of the so-called \"gladiator-human hybrids\" will be sufficient to truly bring economic freedom to Cybertron.**7.** Aside from this human-robot divide, the gladiators have kept their autocratic ways throughout the years. Except in a very few instances, Cybertron has remained in a constant and violent environment.**8.** Despite the large and various charities and political associations that exist in the Autobot gladiator populace however, **the economic liberty and freedom of these gladiators only serves as small relief compared to the autocratic traditions of their society, which is strictly limited in scope because of the government mandates and restrictions imposed upon all industries owned by the gladiators.**9.** This being the situation, more Decepticons and Autobots live in poverty and are in greater political or economic disarray than some wealthy Autobots and Decepticons, even those of high position and that are headquartered in the Central Cybertron region.\n\n### Question:\nWhich Autobot leader's vision inspired the Decepticons?\nOptions: **A.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the Transformers universe, the origins of the Autobots and Decepticons trace back to their home planet Cybertron, a metallic world inhabited by sentient robots capable of transformation. Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance.
