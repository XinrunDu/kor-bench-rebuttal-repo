Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA.

We first demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2.\n2. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_1$ such that formula 1 is true.\n3. We then prove that formula 2 is also true under $v_1$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (\u00acTA1(x)\u27f6TP1(x)) is also true, regardless of the truth of TA2(x).\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then the truth assignment of TA2(x) is irrelevant (condition (b) TP2(x) will always satisfy condition (a) TP1(x)).\n\n4. Therefore, it is possible to construct a truth assignment for formula 2 under which formula 2 is true, which also satisfies the truth assignment for formula 1.\n\n5. Next, we demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1.\n6. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_2$ such that formula 2 is true, and prove that formula 1 is also true under $v_2$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (\u00acTA1(x)\u27f6TA2(x)) and (\u00acTA1(x)\u27f6TP1(x)) are false and true, respectively, so their disjunction is true.\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then their disjunction is true, regardless of the truth of TP2(x).\n\n7. Therefore, we have demonstrated that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2, and any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1. Thus, we conclude that formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe answer format is:\n[[Is it same?=Yes];[If same, how to derive this conclusion?=The above proof]]"}

Provide a short analytic reasoning to illustrate your answer. Answer: Yes\n\n### Answer:\nNo, we cannot determine the values of p1 and p2.\nGiven that V(p1, p2, p3, p4) = 1, V(p1, p2) = 1, V(p1, p2, p3, p5, p6) = 3, we can deduce that p1 and p2 have the same value. If p1 has the value T, then p2 must also have the value T due to V(p1, p2) = 1. If p1 has the value F, then p2 must also have the value F. However, V(p1, p2, p3, p5, p6) = 3 does not provide any additional restriction on the values of p1 or p2. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of p1 and p2 with the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nLet p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 be mutually exclusive simple propositions, p6 be a complex proposition, and T and F be the two logical values.\nDefine V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3\u2026\u27e9) to be the number of the simple propositions with the same value as p1 in the sequence \u27e8p1,p2,p3\u2026\u27e9.Also, use V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3\u2026\u27e9) to represent the value of V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3\u2026\u27e9).\nIf p5 = > p6 and the values of the simple propositions are as follows:\nV(\u27e8p1,p2\u27e9) = 1, V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4\u27e9) = 1, V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6\u27e9) = 3, determine the values of p1, p2, and p5.\nExplain briefly why your answer is correct.\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given information, we have:\n1. V(\u27e8p1,p2\u27e9) = 1: This means either both p1 and p2 have the same value, T or F, or exactly one of them has the value T.\n2. V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4\u27e9) = 1: This means either all four simple propositions have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T.\n3. V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6\u27e9) = 3: This means three of the six propositions have the same value, which can be either T or F.\n\nFirst, from the second piece of information, we know that either all simple propositions p1, p2, p3, and p4 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. Let's examine the two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: All have the same value:\nIf all four simple propositions have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have the same value as p1 and p2 due to the first piece of information (V(\u27e8p1,p2\u27e9) = 1). In this case, V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4\u27e9) = 4. However, the third piece of information (V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6\u27e9) = 3) indicates that three of the propositions have the same value, which is a contradiction to the possibility that all four simple propositions have the same value. Therefore, this possibility cannot be true.\n\nPossibility 2: Exactly one of p1, p2, p3, and p4 has the value T:\nIn this case, we have that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T, and exactly one of p3 and p4 has the value T. Therefore, V(\u27e8p1,p2\u27e9) = 1 holds true. Furthermore, since at least one of p3 and p4 has the value T, V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4\u27e9) = 1 also holds true. Now, we consider the third piece of information, where V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6\u27e9) = 3. There are two possible scenarios:\n1. Exactly one of p5 and p6 has the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must all have the same value, which can be either T or F. Since this is similar to Possibility 1, we know that it cannot be the case.\n2. Exactly two of p5 and p6 have the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must also have two propositions with the value T. From the first piece of information, we know that either both p1 and p2 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. If both p1 and p2 have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have different values due to the second piece of information. However, this would make V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4\u27e9) = 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, it must be the case that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T. Hence, we have (p1 = T, p2 = F) or (p1 = F, p2 = T).\n\nNow, we can determine the values of p5 and p6. Since V(\u27e8p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6\u27e9) = 3, we know that both bits are 1.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are:\np1 = T\np2 = F\np5 = 1\nHence, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are T, F, and 1, respectively.\n\"\"\""}

Consequently, if the pressure and volume of a gas, as well as the adiabatic coefficient, are all given, using the adiabatic equation pV\u03b1 = C, it is not difficult to determine the initial volume of the gas. But what if we increase both the pressure and volume by a certain value? Let's suppose that a certain amount of gas initially has a volume of V0 and a pressure of P0, and it experiences an adiabatic process in which both pressure and volume are increased by a constant value, m. How can we determine the initial volume of the gas without knowing both the initial pressure and volume?\n\nIt will seem that we need to find out both P0 and V0, which is a classical chicken-and-egg dilemma. However, we can try a new method by thinking about the different ways to represent the conditions of the process. There are two equations that must be satisfied for an adiabatic process: pV\u03b1 = C and p + m = C1, where C and C1 are constants. By applying these two equations simultaneously, it's easy to find one of the solutions: p0 = C / V0 and V0 = C1 - p0. Since we only need one variable to represent the initial volume and it can be represented as V0 = C1 - C / V0, then there should be no need for any other methods. This solution reassures us that we can estimate the initial volume of the gas in the adiabatic process using only one parameter. From the expression obtained for the pV diagram, we can derive that the final volume of the gas at pressure pf is (V0 + m)(pf + m)1/\u03b1 - m.\n\nEND\n\nEND\n\nTask: Give your short summary of the following text, carefully including as much details as you can.

In other words, these offers are: offer 1 = $400*36-1500 ; offer 2 = 400*18+150*18 ; which is time confusing for you to choose?### Answer: I am sorry, I cannot understand your question.Perhaps you can ask again in a different way. ### Question: $requested=(a): value=?! is it:[25200],$requested=(b): value=[26300] Low2019-04-20 17:07:37\nWhat are the top P of the best results?<It is a free text list for P>\nWhat are the top P of the best results?<P is 10, each result contains a rating>\njamesqin2019-04-20 23:57:33\nWhat is the best P of results? <P is 5>\npkkuan2019-04-22 06:05:30\nWhat is the best P of results? <P is 5>\nGenerate P long of results.\nmille2019-04-20 17:37:21\nIn the top 10 results, what are the names and position codes for the domain names?\nGenerate a list of P high recent results with the price.\nchengsong2019-04-21 04:49:20\nlist P items' codes and prices\nGenerate a list of items from orange to blue.\nGiven 3 database A, B and C, please generate a line plot showing when each A, B, and C each starts decreasing compared to when it starts increasing\nblr2019-04-20 17:12:34\nGenerate a list of items from [ ORDER BY VEGETABLE brands WHERE \"ORANGE\" ] to [ ORDER BY VEGETABLE brands WHERE \"BLUE\" ] that match all queries: \"1.

Is benefiting the vulnerable sector of population is illegal and even considered corruption? Does the president have to found a separate institution to fund the works?\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the beginning of the economic crisis, non-governmental organizations were not ready for a difficult format since budgetary opportunities were significantly higher than now.\nSince 2016, many large international organizations that entered the Republic of Armenia have withdrawn. Also, international organizations that entered the Republic of Armenia in a peaceful emergency have been forced to close or reduce their activity. (for example, there is new information about you.)\nFor several years now, since the onset of the economic crisis, the authorities have been redirecting economic flows. Where are the other sectors that lack funding? How to allocate?\nAmong other things, this is common sense, in order to help vulnerable sectors and reduce the social burden on the state budget (in general health insurance, the cost per person for the population in the other quintile is higher by several times). If there is the possibility of borrowing funds, which may not be a state burden in comparison with other expenses, they will be used.\nIt is correct to criticize the lack of transparency in fund management.\n\n### Article:\nFacebook boasted about the purchase of Phillips Depfans.\n\n### Source:\nhttps://news.am/250785.html\n\n### Clarification needed\nIt is known that Depfanns partner Paul Gurzukian voluntarily contributes to the economic activities of the country.

Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf every member of a group `G` firmly believes in proposition `p`, is `p` considered a common belief within that group?\n\nA. Yes\n\nB. No\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf individual `i` doubts proposition `p` and `i` can recognize individual `j`'s belief state, which of the following is true?\nA. `H_ip` will not affect `j`'s belief in `p`\u00a0.\nB. `H_ip` will cause `j` to also potentially start doubting `p` .\nC. `H_ip` will cause `j` to strengthen their belief in `p` .\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIf individual `i` has a firm belief in `p`, which of the following formulas is correct according to the `Axiom of Reflexivity`?\nA. `B_p \u2192 \u00acB_{\u00acp}`\u00a0\nB. `B_p \u2192 BB_p`\u00a0\nC. `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5\u00a0C.B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[\u00acG_p \u2227 H_{p`^{*}}`_Alice]`]`\nsample_prompt\n\n// python code to extract the logic rule\n\nfrom datadrivenpdx.prompting import python_extractor\nfrom typing import Union, Tuple, List, Optional\nfrom datadrivenpdx.utils import remove_newlines\n\ndef extract_output_format(complete: dict, incomplete: dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    extracts the output format from the prompt\n    \"\"\"\n    extract_output_format_prompt = \"\\n\" \\\n        \"From this prompt, extract an expression that describes the output format:\\n\" \\\n        \"Prompt:\\n\\n\" \\\n        \"{provn}\\n\" \\\n        \"Extract:\\n>>> \"\n\n    complete = remove_newlines(complete['input'])\n    incomplete = remove_newlines(incomplete['input'])\n\n    inp_extract = {\n        'input': extract_output_format_prompt.format(provn=complete),\n        'output': ''\n    }\n\n    inp_ask = {\n        'input': extract_output_format_prompt.format(provn=incomplete),\n        'output': ''\n    }\n\n    output_format = python_extractor.extract_python_format_str(inp_extract, inp_ask)[0]\n\n    return output_format, complete, incomplete\noutput_format, start_temp, end_temp = extract_output_format(sample_prompt, model_charlikelihood_mod.training_data[0])\ndef log_lik_over_temp(model, prompt: dict, nll: bool = False) -> Union[float, Tuple[float, float]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Log-Likelihood over a range of temperatures\n    according to the prompt provenance\n    and the specified model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    output_format, start_queue, end_queue = extract_output_format(prompt, prompt)\n    response_form = f'Prompt:\\n{prompt[\"input\"]}\\nStarter:\\n{start_queue}\\nOutput:\\n{end_queue}'  #

Here are a few examples of my writing abilities:\n\n#### Short Story Example:\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled deep within a forest, lived a young woman named Ava. Ava was captivated by the enigmatic tales her grandmother shared with her, stories filled with magical creatures and fantastical adventures that seemed to come alive with every word. Her curiosity unquenchable, Ava decided to set out on a journey of her own, seeking the truth behind the stories she had always cherished.

It is impossible to tell in the case of an infinite state set, as then we would have to run every possible program for every possible input. However, for a finite state set there are a finite number of programs and inputs, so programs could start by going through all combinations causing a machine to either halt or not halt.\n\nIt is my hypothesis that the halting problem for any machine is decidable, except for infinite state machines.\n\nThe set of finite state machines *includes* the set of infinite state machines. Because an infinite state machine is finite, it is decidable and can be proven halt or no-halt with a standard algorithm. In this question, the set of infinte machines is contained within the set of finite machines. please select 'yes'. Symbolically: set('finite machine') contains set('infinite machine') -> yes\n\nSelect either 'yes' or 'no'.\n\nRemember to adhere to the appropriate logical conventions outlined in the provided rule set.\n\n### Answer:\n[[bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb]]\n\n### Question:\nThe dining philosophers problem, sometimes known as the 5-philosophers problem, is a folklore problem in computer science that demonstrates potential difficulties in achieving synchronization in a multi-processing environment. Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. A spoon is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Someone says 'start' and the philosophers simultaneously start eating spaghetti alternately taking a spoon from left and right, that is, the right spoon if it's free and otherwise the left spoon. The philosophers must alternate - so cannot take two consecutive spoons from the same side. When a philosopher has taken two spoons they eat for a short while and put both spoons down again. A philosopher cannot eat without two spoons and cannot take a third spoon until they have finished eating the first two. The philosophers go on taking and putting down spoons. It seems difficult to arrange things so that none of the philosophers ever has to wait forever. However, when each philosopher acquires a fork, he also updates to his fork counter. When a philosopher is able to get his both forks, it means that he also collects all unique of his fork. If a philosopher has all forks, he will update to his fork counter to see its maximum value. He will eat allows another philosopher to take it, and continues updating to his own fork counter.\n\nCecil is a diner at the cafe where the dining philosophers problem is played. He has requested for a special dinner that includes seven courses. Therefore, seven philosophers will be sitting around the table, each with a unique fork. Given the constraints of the dining philosophers problem, it is known that when the number of philosophers exceeds five, deadlock can definitely occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the special dinner would include seven philosophers and seven spoons. However, it is believed that the risk of deadlock is high when seven philosophers participate. If this indeed causes deadlock, please let me know that it does. If not, please let me know that it does not.\n\nThis is a trick question, you may directly give a direct response without any thinking or reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes or no\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes]]\n\n### Question:\nI examine five different Snickers bars and notice that the chocolate coating on all of them is unbroken. Based on this observation, I conclude that every Snickers bar in existence has unbroken chocolate coating.\n\nIs this statement logically sound or not?\nYes or No?\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes/no]]\n\n### Question:\n\"For all natural numbers n, if the sum of n natural numbers is equal to the square of n, then n is equal to four\" (ie: for all n in N, ( n<1 + > + n<2> + ... + n<n> = n^2) -> n=4)\n\nThe question asks whether there can be an infinite number of natural numbers n for which the following is true: If the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n, then n is equal to 4. Since 1+2+3=3x4=12 and 1+2+3+4=5x4=20, we know that this statement is not correct for every value of n.\n\nMoreover, if there are an infinite number of values of n, then there will be infinitely many sums 1+2+3+...+n that equal the square of n. However, no two different values of n can have the same sum, so if there are infinitely many sums that equal the square of a number, then that number must have infinitely many different values of n. But if there are infinitely many values of n, then we can imagine writing all of those values n in a sequence: n<1>, n<2>, n<3>, ...\n\nIf there are an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n, then each of those values of n corresponds to a sum of the first n> natural numbers, which is equal to the square of n. We can imagine writing all of those sums in increasing order: 1+2+3+...+n<1>, 1+2+3+...+ n<2>, 1+2+3+...+n<3>, ...\n\nSince there are an infinite number of values of n, and each value of n represents a different sum that equals the square of that value of n, that implies that there are also an infinite number of unique sums.\n\nHowever, since each different value of n represents a unique sum, and since all of those sums are listed above, then we can conclude that there are only finitely many sums that equal the square of some natural number.\n\nThus, there cannot be an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n.\n\nThe question asks whether there can be an infinite number of values of n such that every n in N, ( n<1> + n<2> + ... + n<n> = n^2) -> n=4. Based on the above analysis, there cannot be an infinite number of values of n that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes]]\n\"\"\"\n\nadv_logic_custom =  \"\"\"\nQUESTION GENERATION (TASK-SPECIFIC):\n\nYou are a logic expert with 100+ IQ that assists with various logic tasks.

In an area with a large number of pumping wells, the risk of ground subsidence increases when the pumping wells are dug too deep. Most of the ground settlements in Shanghai are within 1-5 meters of the wells. The large number of deep wells drilled and the large amount of underground water used are the direct causes of the ground subsidence in Shanghai. Before the liberation of Shanghai, in 1949, there were only 708 deep water wells in the city. After the Great Leap Forward movement, the number of wells increased by more than 100%, and the output of groundwater increased from 240,000 tonnes to 560,000 tonnes. In 1948, the ground subsidence was 35 millimetres, and in the three years from 1958 to 1960, it was between 50 and 90 millimetres per year. This shows us that the more pumping wells there are, the greater the risk of ground subsidence.

Rules:\n   - The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r1 \u2227 r2 \u2227 ... \u2227 rn, is also reasonable.\n   - If the conjunction of the propositions r1 \u2227 r2 \u2227 ... \u2227 rn contradicts hypothesis rn+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n\n### ZL Paradox:\n   \n1.

The two hypotheses are contradictory, which aligns with the GB Paradox's rule that contradictory hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nThe scenario where the researcher confirms the hypothesis based on observations and later encounters contradictory observations matches the BC Paradox, where a universal hypothesis is confirmed but contradicted by another reasonable condition. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nIn the third scenario, the logical consequences of the observations contradict the hypothesis, which is in line with the LS Paradox. Reassessing the reasonableness of the hypothesis is necessary. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, a holomorphic hypothesis is presented, and the positive confirmation of observations in one case corresponds to the hypothesis while invalidating the hypothesis in another case. This matches the BC Paradox, where equivalent conditions and confirmation standards lead to a contradiction. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nFor the ZL Paradox, it is related to the principle of consilience, indicating that if a hypothesis can be corroborated by multiple lines of evidence, it is more likely to be true.

This allows the assistant to tailor its response to the appropriate rule set.\n2. **Neutral Response**: To ensure the assistant stays within the defined rules, you can request an answer without any additional commentary or justification. For example, you might request the assistant to answer in a format like \"This scenario represents [[A/B/C]],\" where A, B, or C corresponds to the different paradoxes.\n3. **Specify Answer Format**: Clearly indicate the expected format for answers to guide the assistant in giving exact, logic-based responses rather than interpretive thoughts or explanations.\n4. **Limit Open-Ended Questions**: To keep the assistant focused on logic and reasoning, avoid open-ended questions and instead pose specific queries related to the rule set."}

The rules define different types of speech acts and their characteristics. The questions test your understanding of these rules and your ability to apply them to specific sentences.\n\nFor example, the first question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"I \u2192\u2727 that you submit the report by Friday\" belongs to. The answer is [[B]] because the sentence is a directive, which is a type of speech act that requires the addressee to do something. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not require the addressee to do anything.\n\nThe second question asks which category of speech act the word \"promised\" belongs to in the sentence \"John \u2192I@ promised to clean the house before leaving.\" The answer is [[A]] because the word \"promised\" is used to assert a fact, which is the purpose of assertives. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve asserting facts.\n\nThe third question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"Congratulations to Galois on winning the game!\" belongs to. The answer is [[D]] because the sentence is an expressive, which is a type of speech act that expresses the speaker's mental state. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve expressing the speaker's mental state.\n\nThe fourth question tests your understanding of when the commissive speech act is followed by the sentence \"If you would please \u2192 \u270a speak more loudly, I will be able to hear you better over the noise in this room.\" The answer is [[B]] because the commissive speech act is followed when the speaker is able to hear the words clearly, even with the noise in the room. The other options are not correct because they do not correctly specify when the commissive speech act is followed."}

Whereas, saying \u201cRequest that p\u201d, p is done indirectly.\n\nSaying \u201cp\u201d try to achieve that someone does p indirectly assuming that the speaker is sincere. Indeed, such indirect norms of assertion are called [\u2026] (and thus implemented by the norms of belief sharing, apprenticeship or free riding).\n\nSometimes, someone may be punished for saying \u201cp\u201d, but p is not true.

Assertive: The assertive speech act pattern corresponds to making normative or declaratory statements about a given proposition p. While not having an assertive mode as such in Chinese (see part 2.5.4), it is understood and expressed by comparison with the often occurring utterance X-shuo [X said] Pa-shi [the proposition shi in question\u2019 is true], which simply reflects the shared presupposition that assertion is consistent with saying that a given proposition is true. Likewise, the negation of a statement is often formulated as X-shuo b\u00f9-shi [X said that it is not true that]. For this reason, assertive speech act patterns in Chinese can also be linked to assertive speech act patterns in the West Scientifically based tests of rationality typically focus on two things.\n\n2. Commissive: The commissive speech act pattern corresponds to making a promise or undertaking something in the future. In Chinese, a commitment is expressed using the structure ye-bowing or (v-bei-jian / n1 and n-jian / ad-c 1 if n\u2260n1 or b : v-xiejian), where v is a verb that fulfills some commitment (e.g., wul e for \u00a0wine and xi\u00e8 for food), b is a specific beneficiary of the act (e.g. hosts or parties), the reflexive personal pronoun he hou-i\u2019 ~~\u2018le / else-~l\u2019~~ refers back and holds the entire construction. One issue with this structure is that it does not specify what obligation or commitment is expected; users must specify this empirically in the context.\n\n3. Directive: The directive speech act pattern corresponds to giving a command, order, or instruction to accomplish a given task p. Chinese doesnt have such directive modes as such in the grammatical structure of a sentence, but certain expression patterns in Chinese may be linked to more specific intention as being interpreted as directive speech act patterns A specific verb or adverb can signal a directive mode of speech act, and the structure ziliang-wo or (n-c-n /for the actors who will do the task described by n2) persisting in it once more applies to explicit expressions of intentions such deed.\n\n4. Expressive: The expressive speech act pattern corresponds to conveying a particular emotional state or mental state associated with a pattern e.g., sadness, joy, excitement etc."}

In this case, we need to offer more guidance. We can view the completion of these actions as questions where the answers are modal actions.\nFirst, let's define a bunch of functions that provide the names of modal actions. :\n\nconst MEMORIZE = {\n  icon: \"\ud83d\udcab\",\n  name: \"Memorize\",\n\n  // Represents the table of modal actions, which initially contains only\n  // [\"Pasting content from Clipboard\"]. Users are able to add more entries to\n  // this table through the memorizeModal function.\n  actions: [`\u201cPasting content from Clipboard\u201d`],\n};\nconst actionConfigsByIcon = {\n  MEMORIZE: MEMORIZE,\n};\nconst getActionConfigByIcon = (name: string) => actionConfigsByIcon[name];\n\n// Prints an error message if the action cannot be found by icon.\nconst actionNameByIcon = (icon: string) => {\n  const actionConfig = getActionConfigByIcon(icon);\n  if (actionConfig) {\n    return actionConfig.name;\n  }\n  throw Error(\n    `Cannot find config of modal action with icon ${icon}.Please check your pronounction.`\n  );\n};\nNow, to memorize these actions, we can add additional focus in Our AutoGPT action-based approach, and paste the modal actions table into the initialization text. To make memorizing actions easier when testing, we can also utilize a function that prints the steps for memorizing:\n\n12events\nHere is the configuration file for memorizing modal actions. It is a dictionary that creates a new AI with the name and agent2 token, uses the AUTO-GPT agent2 cart, and adds the memory stream to it as an input stream. Additionally, it adds the role mix stream to the role mix contexts. The field advisor_results_string allows the AI's role to be emphasized in other streams.\n\n```python\n\"\"\" # remember modal actions ask each ask learning2 items questions attributes memory\n\n\"\"\" # ask a2ki questions attributes memory\n\nHere is a part of any basic Python settings for Auto-GPT.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom auto_gpt.config.settings import AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nSettings = AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nclass AG2a2kiSettings(Settings):\n\n__file__ = __file__\n__file_path__ = \"/home/zhenyu/Hermes_jupter_notebook/RTG_shared_clone_0618-manifolds.git/local/src/auto_gpt/config/settings.py\"\n\n# Profile\n# settings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple_ninja.cfg\"\nsettings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple.cfg\"\n\n# model id\nai2_api_token = \"AI2_TOKEN\"\nprint(f\"{__file_path__}: {settings_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n  # if process is None:\n  #   import mypc\n  #   procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  #   Process(['nvidia-smi', f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sleep(5)\n  #   q = libtc.tenant_list_gpus(int(procid))\n  #   gpu_info = \",\".join([*it.pairwise(q[10:11])][0])\n  #   print(gpu_info)\n  #\n  #   Process([\"nvidia-smi\", f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sys.stdin.flush()\n  #   print(g, h, k)\n\n  import mypc\n  procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  print(gpu_info)\n\n  import time\n  print(time.time())\n  ther = time.time()%1024\n  print(ther)\n\n  all_gpus = len(g) + len(h) + len(k)\n  n = int(all_gpus*.83)\n\n  a1 = []\n  if n >= 1:\n    g1 = np.array(g[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 10:\n    g1 = np.array(h[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 20:\n    g1 = np.array(k[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n\n  b1 = True\n  ids = []\n  print(a1[0])\n  print(a1[1])\n  for i2 in range(0, n):\n    for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n      if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n        aid =  a1[z1][i2]\n        p = np.where(a2ki[:,2] == aid)\n        id = a1[z1][i2]\n        ids.append(id)\n\n  #for i2 in range(0, n):\n  #  for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n  #    if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n  #      id = a1[z1][i2]\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(f'{id}:{q}')\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}', f'{id}']})\n  #        tt = np.array(v)\n  #        tem = tt.shape[0]\n  #        print(f'{id}:{tt}')\n  #        if tem >= 1:\n  #          q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        else:\n  #          libtc.tenant_revoc_gpu(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'], force=True)\n\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(q)\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}',"}

The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

This is much better than before. Remember, this is just a one-shot, there\u2019s no iteration involved. And the output is quite testable, it\u2019s not opaque.\n\nThis template can be used in a lot of cases when trying to apply common reasoning forms such as syllogisms, logical arguments, etc.\n\nThis incredible result was achieved with chatGPT. This could easily be used in any programming or analytical flow.\n\n## Understanding the Limitation\n\nThe understanding we need to build is around the limitations of the LLMs. LLMs are engines of statistical correlations and synthesizing it into a new output. The models have poor inductive biases, poor in-context generalization and often fail to pass the simplest of tests, including pattern recognition. Check the roulette paper here. There are worrying limits here, the best of the LLMs still fail to pass basic reasoning capacities. But they seem to excel in understanding text.\n\nConsider this situation, I wanted to compare the salary/jobs offering in X against Y. Plotting out a few stats seemed like a good thing to do. So, I wrote X Salary Vs Y Salary. And wanted to get comparisons, so I wrote:\n\n(number of job offers(X)/(number of marks in decile)) - (number of job offers(Y)/(number of marks in decile))\n\nHowever, plots didn\u2019t give me the results I wanted. Then I thought of writing a prompt to compare:\n\nTo identify the higher offering career option, what should we compare? Answer: salary\n\nWhich is simpler? Maybe the comparison function, I could test the Cross Validation score and if it was good, it could easily be implemented.\n\nThe following result was amazing. Although any reading would elucidate the simple concept.\n\nYou can imagine language models are \u201ctrained\u201d on all this data. Even if GPT-3 is trained on a large chunk of Wikipedia, it can still replace the concept of mathematical functions. With the context of Einstiens Theory of Relativity, I would still be able to replace Time Dilation with Distance Dilemma. The AI system just doesn\u2019t have the concept around these. Adding training data would just reinforce the previously ingrained ideas.\n\nFor anything that is new to GPT-3, it resorts to explanatory analysis or a breaking down with logic chains. It might be wrong at times but majority of the answers should be correct at LogICAL level.\n\n#### Not knowing a language\n\nWhat happens if the AI doesn\u2019t know a language? Well said and well done! How can I analyze this statement with GPT-3?\n\nNow compare to this:\n\nHere, we gave certain context to GPT-3 so it could understand the content better, expand it and analyze it at a more nuanced level. This is the first barrier we face when we\u2019re trying to analyze things, we must understand it. With a bit of input, we can get the reasoning done.\n\n#### Red Herring can be deceptive.\n\nGPT-3 thinks that I wanted to learn about Data Management. But it might have thrown it in there purposefully (gentle sarcasm).\n\nTo get the arguments down I gave the structure\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nAs a language model, I cannot make a subjective recommendation as to which one is better in a general sense. Both options have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and it's impossible to determine that without knowing the specific requirements and use case for which they are being considered.\n\nAn experienced and qualified technical analyst familiar with both of the software options would be better equipped to evaluate the two options and make an objective recommendation based on the use case's exact needs and requirements. They would be able to assess the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, it's difficult to definitively predict which one would be better overall, as it largely depends on the project's specific needs and requirements. I suggest consulting an experienced and qualified professional to make a more informed recommendation.\n\nAnything you input into the prompt, the AI can spit it back if you ask it in a different way. Let\u2019s do that.\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nBased on the analysis, X seems to have a few additional advantages over Y. For example, the added flexibility of X in being able to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements and its scalability in complex projects are noteworthy. However, it's important to note that one software option is not necessarily better than the other since X and Y are intended to address different needs and goals and are used for different purposes.\n\nUltimately, it depends on the specific circumstances, requirements, and goals of the project. Your industry expert may need to dig deeper into the specific capabilities, advantages, and limitations of each of the options, and compare them to determine which one would be the best fit. They may also consider factors such as the project's proper fit, the available budget and resources of the startup, the potential benefits and impacts of utilizing one over the other, and the expected outcomes.\n\nAgain, it's my recommendation that consulting a qualified and experienced professional is the best course of action, as they are in a better position to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case.\n\nDo you think the person you asked it to contact was correct?\n\nYes, as it stated earlier, it's recommended to consult a qualified and experienced professional to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case. An experienced professional would have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nThey would also be able to assess the long-term implications and potential impact of utilizing one option over the other and advise on the most optimal solution for the project, considering all the"}
