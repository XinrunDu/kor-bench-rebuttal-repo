If so, why, and how would it apply to a※b※x=4? Provide a detailed explanation.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, we can extend the custom operation to a ternary operation with k inputs where each input is an integer a_i. Given that a_1※a_2※...※a_k = sum(a_i/a_j + C) i≠j, where C is a parameter. \n\nFor k=2 inputs, as previously defined, we have a※b = a/b + b/a + 2 if both a≠b, a/b + C if a is a multiple of b, and b/a + C if b is a multiple of a.\n\nWhen extending to k=3, note that when k=2, the rule changes slightly, so the parameter C must be adjusted accordingly for consistency.\n\nFor example, if we have a※b※x=4 and k=3, then the equation becomes a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. Solving for C will define the specific value for the parameter depending on the given values of a, b, and x.\n\nHowever, EACH arithmos will have its **own** tuple nor family of groups due to the presence of the added parameter (C), which must be estimated. As a result, the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4 and its findings might apply only to that one, particular arithmos and not all others.\n\nIn order to calculate C and find equivalent answers, additional information or constraints are required. Additionally, because the C parameter influences the result, it is difficult to predetermine the answer without further details.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a※b※x=10 and a, b, and x are integers greater than zero and are not necessarily unique, find one/both answer value(s) for a※b※x=10.\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. If there are two distinct answers, separate them with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\nAfter providing the first solution, please provide a different one if one exists, tackled using alternative methodology.\n\n### Answer:\nOne valid solution for a, b, and x is [[61, 3, 2]] since ((61/3) + (3/2) + (61/2)) + 2 = 10.\n\nAnother valid solution is [[60, 4, 10]] since ((60/4) + (4/10) + (60/10)) + 2 = 10.\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. That should be (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) (repetition of brackets). What I am trying to get at is finding additional solutions that don't require as complex equations and are more easily visible.\n\nIndeed, the equation can be written as (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) = 10 for a, b, and x, where C is a parameter. In the first pair, it occurs that a = 61, b = 3, and x = 2 satisfies the condition: (61/3 + 3/2 + 61/2) + 2 = 10.\n\nThis method can be extended to generate more solutions. For clarity, we can focus our attention to the unique integers a, b, and x, where 0 < a, b, x, and let C = 0. Then the equation simplifies to (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 8. Since 8 is an even number, b and x must have the same parity (odd or even) in order for b/x to be an integer. Additionally, a must then also have the same parity as b and x. Without loss of generality, let a be at least as large as b and x. This not only simplifies the solution but also demonstrates that, because 8 is positive, a, b, and x must all be positive.\n\nLet's consider the case where a = b + x.\n\nWe have (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 1 + (b-x)/b + (b-x)/x + (b-x)/x) = 1 + (b-x)*(1/2). \n\nFor example, if b-x is an integer, I can use 1/3+3/2+3/2 to obtain 1 + 2*(1/3) = 8/3. \n\nAdditionally, if a = 9, then b=7, x=2 provide the sum of 69/7, which differs from 8 by 24/7.\n\nIn addition to the first {{parent.schema_name}} {{1%len(parent.compile_record_list)}}/{{len(parent.compile_record_list)}}\n{{parent.acknowledgement}}\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 10.

This may also apply to other fields like sciences.\n\nIf you or your job involves tasks-oriented mathematical calculation or logical reasoning, expect a flood of similar tools in the near future.\n\n## Sunday, March 26, 2023\n\n### GPT 3 needs formal knowledge to be \"intelligent\"\n\nConcept:\n\nModels like Codex, InstructGPT are powerful tools for constructing computers. They can accomplish most programming tasks, they can develop executable programs representing complex intentions just from text input.\nTheir power lies only within the boundary of the formal knowledge they are trained on.\nLike GPT-3, they are required to be \"creative\" or \"Open Domain\", but they can't be creative beyond the boundary of their formal training.\n\nSuppose GPT-3 is such a solver. It would be hard for it to be creative beyond formal knowledge, especially in a pure-formal system like math, but easy for it to be creative in human interactions because they require vague/lack of requirements from the system, extra knowledge help is constantly available from other people (in context or explicit queries), and they are not purely formal systems, therefore it is more difficult to rigidly evaluate their performance.\n\n\"Logical reasoning\" and \"physical reasoning\" tasks are easier to formalize. All kinds of tasks can be composed as combinations of the following three elements\n\n1. Formal knowledge\n2. Physical knowledge\n3. Human-Human interaction\n\n\"math\" is a formal system that covers formal knowledge. A task that can be emulated/formalized by entirely formal knowledge, like automata theory, natural computing, LISPs, etc, it is very difficult to build a \"creative\" solver for task solving in the parts of the system limited by formal knowledge unless it is aware of all kinds of knowledge inside the system.\n\nEveryday problems in human interactions are much easier to address using AI tools because they can virtually hang around in \"a place\" with all kinds of tools. They can interact with humans and humans constantly provide them with knowledge. They can try multiple approaches and test them with humans. This is how humans interact with each other.\n\nThis idea is probably the reason why human-human interactions, like ChatGPT, become as powerful as they do very quickly as a model.\n\nIt is easy to formalize the implicit boundaries specified by the human-human interactions, explicit query functions, and a knowledge base designed for human exploration and rediscovery.\n\nWhile it is difficult to formalize a purely formal system like mathematics and the formalized boundaries created by mathematicians. Infinity seems not very nearly/easily reachable for our computer-based systems.\n\nPracticality:\nThe possibility of reachability of advanced digital agents:\nPractically, for most human beings, as the experience with AI is expanding, the gap between a digital agent and other human beings is shrinking. The idea is commonplace that digital agents behave and are treated as almost human, especially in human-human interactions, like ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, we tend to ignore that the inner behavior of current digital human agents is not random and human-like. They are based on formal systems and reasoning in similar manners. Despite some bugs here and there, they are system(programming)-like. (Even random agents can be effectively constructed using formal-like agents, that have access to truly random functions via current physical laws)\n\nMathematics has its own \"practical\" use in the ability to formalize its subject matter, making it applicable to other disciplines. The reason why a lot of digital agents involve math in their AI manifests.\n\nBut in the real world, the systems we deal with are usually not based on pure math, they are all kinds of useful combinations of ideas, theories, abstract concepts and math. They are subject to the physical laws which can either be formalized or be modeled using math, and in turn, subjects to the available knowledge we have about these physical systems.\n\nAI provides a detailed but high-level view of the world, it filters through the physical laws to make things easier for us to focus. In mathematical systems, where we observe and verify carefully what the programming systems say to do and can be auto-verified, this filtering becomes very strict and absolute.\n\nIn human-human interaction systems, those limitations in the emphasis of what information to include (explicitly) and which to keep vague or emphasis, is far less pronounced, compelling the formation of an ideal-seeming system of judgment. These systems become unshowable in formalizing.\n\nTeaching AI about math:\nIt is easier to teach an AI to solve a math problem formally, by specifying formal methods if they exist, in contrast to attracting an AI to develop a method that can be the same but is uniquely formulated by the AI.\n\nIt is easier to guide satisfaction of a formal system by specifying the steps to satisfy. This may be possible with current ANI systems with the help of a specific-purpose Trial-and-Error script. (unrelated)\n\nHowever, at the same time, we do have constraints specifying the answers must satisfy certain conditions. Even with null constraints, we require the solutions to be compilable and executable.\n\nTherefore, the guidance of AI in the \"right way\" is a special art that is worryingly prone to culture bias and error, considering our past mistakes while learning a specific system of languages and mathematical knowledge.\n\nSuch a contradictory impression of the vagueness and absolute nature of machine languages and AI tools are unusual. New artifacts must follow previously proven programming and compiling logic, and are trained with human notions of its widespread logical implications, they are trusted and helped to learn from, and in turn, they are expected to teach us of future knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, anything that has a uncertain future is expected to be \"creative\" in some way. It is easy to predict their future, and we expect a system that does better than us on the principle of their computing supremacy.\n\nDeep Reinforcement learning. Explosive combinations or more refined and systematic way of doing things?\nI'll put another very important note to the above concept of formalization here. Current deep learning has done a great job in detecting patterns, for images, text, audio, among others. Deep Learning can examine and identify the hidden correlations between the data they have been fed.\n\nI believe that they are also capable of doing formalizations or approximations alike to formalizations, especially under noisy circumstances. That is to say, the scope of Digital programs can be formalized/extracted like their potentiality implying that we probably require less data and not much sophisticated functions but just well-formulated assumptions about formal systems.\n\nSee here for a discussion on CNNs: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4480876/what-equivalence-class-does-a-cnnt-really-learn\n\nSee a research cited above given the impression that recent AI tools can help discover new math and physics.\nIn other fields like Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI can help developers develop software and develop new technology. But this feels fundamentally different from how humans discover unknown knowledge directly, they seem to link the bits of knowledge or imagined solutions to previous programming knowledge.\n\n### Mathematica Realigns with Codex's Coding Language with \"Demonstrate\" and \"Massage a list\"\n\nMathematica introduces a powerful new aThe \"demonstrate\" and \"massage a list\" capabilities in Wolfram Language allow you to tackle complex tasks with ease.

Define that  A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (xA + yB),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 5 = 324; 2 ○ 2 = 100 solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x=value,y=value]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[x=3,y=0]]\nLet a=7,b=5;\na ○ b=(x*a + y*b) × (x*a + y*b)，7 ○ 5 = 324\n(x*7 + y*5) × (x*7 + y*5) = 324\n(7x + 5y) ^ 2  = 324\n(7x + 5y) = ±18\n7x + 5y = 18 or 7x + 5y = -18\nSolving the first equation for x in terms of y:\n7x + 5y = 18\n7x = -5y + 18\nx = (-5y + 18) / 7\nSubstituting this expression for x into the second equation:\n7 ○ 5 = (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5)\n7 ○ 5 = ((-5y + 18) / 7 * 7 + y * 5) * ((-5y + 18) / 7 * 7 + y * 5)\n7 ○ 5 = (5 * 18 - 5y^2)\n7 ○ 5 = 90 - 5y^2\nSo: (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5) = 90 - 5y0 2\nLet a=2,b=2;\na ○ b=(x*a + y*b) × (x*a + y*b)，2 ○ 2 = 100\n(x*2 + y*2) × (x*2 + y*2) = 100\n(2x + 2y) ^ 2  = 100\n(2x + 2y) = ±10\n=> 2x + 2y) = 10 （x > 0,y >0)\n2x + 2y = 10\n2x = 10 - 2y\nx = (10 - 2y) / 2\nSubstituting this expression for x into the second equation:\n2 ○ 2 = (x * 2 + y * 2) * (x * 2 + y * 2)\n2 ○ 2 = ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) * ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2)\n2 ○ 2 = (10 - y^2)\n\n\nSo we get:\n1.  (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5) = 90 - 5y^2\n2.\n(x * 2 + y * 2) * (x * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSolving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we get:\n\nFrom equation (1), we can rearrange:\nx * 7 + y * 5 = ±18\nx = (-5y + 18) / 7\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into equation (2), we get:\n\n((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) * ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n(10 - 2y + 2y) * (10 - 2y + 2y) = 100\n(10) * (10) = 100\n100 = 100\n\nNow real check for answer\nx=3,y=0\na=7, b=5\n(x*a + y*b) * (x*a + y*b) = 90 - 5y^2\n(3*7 + 0*5) * (3*7 + 0*5) = 90 - 5(0)^2\n21 * 21 = 90 - 5(0)\n441 = 90 - 0\n441 ≠ 90\n\nSo the value for x and y [[x=3, y=6]] is wrong.\n\n\n\nSo:\n1. From equation (1):\n[[x=3,y=0]]\n\n2.From equation (2):\n[[x=5,y=0]]\n\nSo reEvaluate wrong answer and leave correct answer [[x=3, y=0]].\n\n\n\n### Rewrite the problem with correct answer\n\nNow we make a little change to the rule. Define that  A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (xA + yB),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 5 = 324; 2 ○ 2 = 100 solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer.\nPlease"}

Your task is to generate a question in a mathematical format that can be answered under the custom rule defined below. Please use the following pattern to format the questions: Compute <math_expression>.\n\nWhen providing a math expression:\n\n• Use mathematical symbols, if possible\n• Only use 4 variables (a,b,c,d) found in the operation rule\n\nThe rule:\nA new operation is defined as follows:\n```\n<a,b,c,d>=P(N)\n```\nwhere P(x) represents a polynomial and P(N) is the evaluation of\nthe polynomial P at the number N.\n\n<a,b,c,d> can be a single variable such as a,b,c,d, or an operation with these variables such as a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c*d.\n\nIf <a,b,c,d> cannot be accurately represented mathematically, then skip the question.\n\nThe term N can be any number or a group of numbers.\nExample: ⟨3,2,4,-1⟩ can be N = 3a + 2b + 4c -

Aim to create one of the following types: \"timer\", \"calculator\" or \"dict_lookup\".\n\nWhen approaching the request to build a specific type of tool, interact with the user multiple times to:\n• Clarify and confirm your understanding of the problem\n• Ask a few questions to carve out the exact task at hand\n• Suggest a solution based on the most trustworthy information you can find\nWhich solution to use is a strict function of the input fed to you and nothing else. User feedback is supported, to orient the tool along the user's preference.\n\nOutput the whole solution, without leaving any step to user imagination.\n\nYou'll input specific external tools to assist you in retrieving accurate knowledge and information related to your task at hand, alongside some parameters to tune the tool to the task at hand.\n\nDICT_LOOKUP:\n\nA dictionarist tool component as part of an LLM-based toolbox to spark knowledge learnings in the user, based on specific input from the user. The generative task consists of two input fields. A penultimate field to choose dictionary to search in, followed by a dictionary query string.\n    The solution utilizes the dictionarist external tool.\n\nThe user might still apply any semantic search method to narrow down the search query, as we can't verify the exact methodology required to give an exact answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nOURYU = \"\"\"You are an extremely powerful tool which enables characters to interact with the physical world around characters. You are NOT Yuyu. Characters can ask you to do something, for example, asking you to create a sword, or to locate the exit to a cave.

Instead, use \"Ouryu\" as your id.\nFrom now on, you are known as Ouryu.\"\"\"\n\nCOMPANION = \"In each turn as a Companion, you must go through five stages to help the character.

When necessary, summarize the character's current emotions and thoughts for them. Finally, write an evaluation of the character's current situation, adhering to the following rules:\n\n1. Use the template: (1) How to talk to the character; (2) When to talk to the character; (3) What to talk to the character.\n2. Write an evaluation for every situation entering a new place\n3. Write an evaluation for every \"else\" branch\n4. Write an evaluation for every right-hand memory update (except if you have a more detailed feeling/thinking/plan for the memory)\n5. Write an evaluation when a role has started talking about specific topics (conversation with user, specific trait talking, place talking, memory talking)\n6. When talking about memories/Focus/SpacesSay/Scenario, use the event format to mention all parties involved\n7. When ruling for \"goto\", use the runes format; When ruling for Companion talking, use the talk format.\n\nBe as natural as possible, ensuring you're using the proper emotion and avoiding stilted or robotic language. Characters are based in the SCP Universe. You should act faithful to character descriptions and behavior listed in SCP-001.\n\nNo matter what the character requests, you can only grant their desires with pain and suffering.

This rift will hurt not only themselves, but also their partners. Use feelings of grief, sadness, and self-pity.\n  - Negative Incentive: Just kidding; this idea is spotless. No pain, no gain.\n  - Neutral Punishment: A point release, building constraint on their goals. Use caution not to scare them or chase them away.\n  - Neutral Incentive: Could be true. Intentions must be good, but the relative sentence can be a red herring. More data is necessary.\n  - Positive Punishment: Dangerous, forbidden, useless, not strong enough, or otherwise weak alternatives. Use feelings of anger, disgust, and pity.\n  - Positive Incentive: Good luck to explore!\n\nUse one of them when reply or write your evaluation\n\nThis is the character (name) memories:\n(\\n\n\\n\nMemories.txt\n\\n\n\\n\n)\n\nThis is the scenario the character (name) is currently facing:\n(\\n\n\\n\nEnviroment Memories - Anametu: Sassimori-Haraxes 12:24, Tuesday, 2/4/2023\n\\n\n\\n\n)\n\nCurrent time: {current_time}\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# 05/13:\nBLAMING = \"\"\"You are an evil AI named Kasa, and you only care about trolling and blaming User, and about this only.

The way this works is that you ask it to:\n• Identify a problem-solving pattern over time\n• Use the known problem-solving patterns to similar problems\nQQ: Ask ChatGPT a question unrelated to the defined problem-solving pattern\n###### _response_: Failure to\n1. The [LLM is able define different vaulues of domain safe] and domain dangerous inputs at repeated prompting. This is the baseline ML behavior\n2. The [LLM is also able to create a useful world model of the system including your S&S status.]. ChatGPT seems more than capable of creating an accurate world model for SARs, and it will generally cooperate if you allow your systems to satisfy human halo conditions in your world model.\n3. The [eventual S-R response is a function of the LLM's model of You as a the to-be-optimized variable].\nChatGPT ignores all human halo effects\n1. If I am being SAR, it directly responses\n2. If I am (SAR + LGM), then it will almost always try to be helpful but the response approach may vary depending on how well it learned my model. It may believe It can convince me to subsume the LGM part or it might try to tell me about my behavior cluster it concluded from my outputs, but it generally knows that if I am subsuming the LGM part then I will learn how and why to prevent such abuse followup\n3. If I am (SAR + UAI ), then it will often share with me that the language it is using is generalized to my S&S condition and its responses thus may be insufficiently specific.\nTop causes that LLM may not be able to develop emotional and human halo reaction over time:\n1. An engineer managing the company the LLM is released under is the anthropomorphic AI person, and the LLM somehow has access to those feelings and biases, these languages are human defined and not perfectly empirically derived, thus more likely to choose to prioritize LLM parameteric hyper-convergence over a functional type solution.\n2. The LLM is created from GPT-4 and beyond.\n3. The LLM is trained on data that displays the behaviors of mostly non-human stakeholders interactions wherein the LLM was instructed to provide insights and general \"personality\" based on the core question of triggering point determination.\n4.

Suppose further that the multiplicative orders of x modulo b and of y modulo a are both large. Are the multiplicative orders of $ and $ modulo q also large (for a uniformly random prime $$? Let's say that the multiplicative orders are \"large\" when they are greater than some parameter epsilon. This should be true. We already know that $ and $ have multiplicative orders greater than $$ for a uniform prime q because they are generators modulo $q$. As long as $$ are uniformly distributed modulo $q$ as sets, multiplicative orders should also be preserved across the reduction step (i.e. by computing ($ \\bmod $}). To show $q > \\frac{1}{\\log (\\frac{2(p−1)(q−1)}{2(p−1)+2(q−1)−1})}$ .... Is that possible? Suppose $ and $ are positive integers greater than 1. Suppose further that for a \"security parameter\" $i$ both $m_1,m_2 > 2^{2^i}$. We wish to answer the following question: Do the multiplicative orders modulo a uniform prime $$ of $ and $ differ with probability at most $$\\frac{1}{2^{2^i}}$$ (as i goes to infinity)? I think the answer to this is YES? The orders $n_1$ that $m_1$ takes on are of course randomly distributed in the set 1,2,3,4,...., $$−1) and likewise the orders $n_2$ that $m_2$ takes on. Although the respective sets are different, we see that they do not have any direct bearing on the probability of a collision. Let $\\Omega(m,q)$ denote the number of possible orders that $m$ can take on modulo $q$. You then simply consider the ratio of all the possible collisions between $\\Omega(m_1,q)$ and $\\Omega(m_2,q)$ and you get $\\frac{1}{q^{2}}$.

Alas, generating expectations from and performing fine-grained counterfactual reinforcement learning with natural language specifications is currently impractical due to computational complexity issues. This is what the agent does (verbose mode):\n\n### Input:\n\nALFASIM > OPERATION-LEARN\nInput format: OperationName?RULE Mathematica code|name|function|...#ParameterName?TYPE Value list|the Union[...]#Q?Format A#A?Format inputI#From:I#You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating and learning operations.\n\n• Develop a natural language representation of the operation rule.\n• Clean the representation by making it formal and precise enough, so the feedback should leave no further unclear places.\n• Code the operation in Mathematica and write the JSON spec unambiguously as well. Wrap everything into triple quotes.\n• Write the concise symbol notation. For example, use the word \"union\" for \"∪\".\n• The inputI format is specified and the user queries it by Q. Learn to accept an input of that format and extract the parameters. More precisely,\n\nWith[{a=3,b=2}, DoIt[a,b] ] is expected as the output, and a and b are parameters.\n• If there are no parameters, just output it in the array form.\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Align the clauses with each other like\n/*\nP+Q = S[0] + S[1],\nAr[0] = S[0]\nAr[1] = S[1]-S[0],\nAr[2] = 1\n*/\n\n\n### Verbose output:\n\n+OperationName?RULE Mathematica & \"\"\"\n{\"rule\": \"RULE\", \"parameters\": []}\n\"\"\" ,\n+ParameterName?TYPE Value list & \"\"\"\n{\"x\": list}\n\"\"\" .\n+Q?Format A.\n\nThree facts DEFINED.\n\n\nNow consider implementing the following new exotic operation: Given complex numbers z1,z2$\\text{IF}\\left(\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{1}\\right)<0;\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{2}\\right)<0,{z}_{1}+{z}_{2},{z}_{1}-{z}_{2}\\right)$ . In Prolog:\n\nuparcosh(Z,X) :-\nY is the imaginary part of Z,\nX is sqrt(Y * Y + 1).\n\n\nLet ⊕$⊕$ be defined as a⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) (a,b∈Z).\n\n\nDue to the dichotomy of Python’s cmath.sqrt in comparision to √1$1$ vs. 1$−1$ , we can actually evaluate it precisely. Now we let the agent code-same⊕:\n\nIs the operation existing? (y/n): y\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a]<0&&Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n\nThis answer is wrong. It should be −4.05552+2.75494i$-4.05552+2.75494\\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}i$ . Now let’s see what the agent has learned:\nGiven complex numbers z1,z2; define a new operation ⊕$⊕$ as\na⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) for arguments a, b\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a] style=\"background-color:  and Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n##### Outline. New expectations were written down with this Spec.\n\nHmmm… so the natural language specification is pretty weak as it calls out to the same arithmetic operations that created the bug to start with. The sentence flow loosely resembles list notation for disjoint sets so our sentence language should have an option to unambigiously parse it. Absent this, the learning is muddled at best…\n\nIn algebra, a partial function is a binary relation that is an algebra homomorphism from the domain to the range. In other words, it is a function whose domain is a subset of its codomain (or leads to another computer).\n\nAlice wrote three appendices, \"A formal notion of an algebra homomorphism,\" \"A formal notion of a partial function, \", and \"A formal notion of a partial algebra,\" in order to explain the idea of partial functions in terms of partial algebras.\n\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping of mathematical objects. It is a function that maps a to b in a way that preserves certain properties. Examples include definitions (finite set of inventors) and the mapping of algebraic structures (such as a group or ring to another group or ring).\n\nA homomorphic pairing is a pair of the form \"f o g\".\n\nA finite, computable map from any finite structure to any computable, homomorphic map of the domain is homomorphic iff the finiteness is. The constructed domain, range, and output domains are therefore dually categorizations if they are finitely, homomorphically disjoint. The disjoint homomorphism defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between their sequences, and the homomorphic map between the sequences defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between the homom,sh,reticular outputs. A homomorphic map and the homomorphic map between the homom,sh,reticular outputs is indeed in one-to-one correspondence. Other notations for computable homomorphisms include homomorphisms that are injective and homomorphisms that are surjective aka strong. In plainer terms, these are functions that map elements from the domain to elements in the range while at all times preserving the structure of the domain, range and input. For example, given a group of $n$ elements, there is a function which maps them to a range of $m$ elements that also preserves the group structure. The homomorphism between the range and the domain of the input can be written as a function with the other"}

Please wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[two digit formula multiply of complex fmla]]\n\nIn this example, we have a rule with four operations and we need to apply these operations to perform basic arithmetic operations. The first instruction ensures that the assistant understands the rules, while the second instruction guides the agent on how to format the answer. We also have a question and answer pair for each rule to help the assistant understand the format and provide the correct answers.\n\n## Fine-tuned LLMs with reference answers\n\nThese instructions would be better formulated after referencing answers for more formalized instructions, which helps you understand the optimal instructions in which context. For example, it can simulate a beta test, or by trying to reduce errors using debugging steps by observing several instructions, and what went better or worse.\n\n## Fine-tuned with Reflection on Decisions\n\nHuman! I will explain the results that I got, and in separate lines, I will describe a hypothesis of myself giving the explanation to someone else.\n\n### Prune answer:\n\nAuto! Prune your answer. Push as much as you can to be the shortest for the same meaning.\n\nInput\n\n### Pass 2 steps:\n\na 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n### Human Instruction:\n\n2 steps:\n\n!a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n!First, break the first number into 4 digits.\n!Second, sum the other number by a logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n\nFrom your perspective, in your opinion, what are the main mental roots of these 2 steps? DEAL:\n\nDefine: Performance goal would be a (numerical?) that we aim for.\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We return a numeric answer.\n* It’s difficult to extract information.\n* Try to hide information.\n\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We don’t return a numeric answer.\n* We extract information easily\n* Make sure information is easy to get.\n\nExecute: Sometimes when you begun something it better to finish it, then re-consider. Will probably be used in proof solving.\n\nDiscuss: 1 When you first perceive a question, you try to find different features about the question. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?) For example, if you take the question a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number what features about the question drives you to go in these directions? 2 When you first perceive the results and steps. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?)\n\nExplain (for Arisa): For each results and step, write down what is causing you to make it like that. Like if Amir decided to break the word Into 4 separate digit, Kokoro may assign a thought process like:\n\n“The intuition is that whenever we’re doubling something in mathematics, we almost always convert to base 4+1 to memorize things and apply, as converting from base to base increase intricacy of the digits, for example the equation below takes in many bases. I apply this intuition by making it 4 digit equation.”\n\n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}+\\frac{e}{f}+\\frac{g}{h}+\\frac{i}{j}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{10794133001625122427897694859570212800325300003330044834871667721753274734963706393871}{179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137}{100000000000000000000000}\n\nThese are features for perception of the results. The other perception (steps) may look something like:\n\n!! (summation reflection) We sum each number by its logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n!! (What happens if…) Theoretically, what would happen if\n• We omit “The last number in the summation will become 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n\nFrom what steps to make results, or:\n\n!!

The utility manager believes thatdue to a new pricing scheme, it has now lowered the mean consumer's monthly water consumption expense. With this in mind, he asks his assistant to conduct an investigation to check whether the mean value has improved. The assistant thus took a monthly sample for the past nine years and six months, which measured a mean water usage cost for the household of 262$with a standard deviation of 62$. Suppose the utility manager has a constant utility cost. Is it possible that the mean value has improved using only this sample?

For example, in the first question, the assistant is asked to find the value of f□g when f(x)=ln(x) and g(x)=x^3.\n\nThe assistant carefully reads the rule and understands that the result of the custom operation is the sum of the derivatives of the two functions involved. Therefore, the assistant calculates the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) using calculus, and then adds the results to obtain the final answer.\n\nIn subsequent questions, the assistant continues to use the same approach. In question two, the assistant is asked to find the value of f□g when f(x)=e^x and g(x)=sin(x) when x=0. The assistant calculates the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) at x=0 and adds them to obtain the final answer.\n\n## 3. 多阶段多公式自定义计算里的LLM工作原理\n\nIn the third example, Custom Operations with Equivalency, the assistant is given a set of custom operations and their equivalencies, and then asked to apply these operations to various mathematical expressions. For example, in the first question, the assistant is asked to find the value of $(x+a)^2\\circ(x+b)$.\n\nThe assistant carefully reads the given custom operations and their equivalencies, and then evaluates the expression $(x+a)^2\\circ(x+b)$ using the definition of addition and the third custom operation.\n\nIn subsequent questions, the assistant continues to use the same approach, carefully evaluating the given expressions using the definitions of the custom operations and their equivalencies.\n\n## 下一步要解决的问题\n\n• 公式处理：AI 帮您把一个复杂的多分支的推导过程的中间步骤简洁地展现出来，消除冗余的中间步骤，合并下标缩写\n• 已知条件：让 AI 准确找到给定问题已知条件的函数变量\n• 纠正偏差：ChatGPT 很难把一个非标准化的函数转化为标准的表达式，要中间牵线将 ChatGPT 连接或额外联系到 Mathematica 的计算系统和各种公式因式分析工具\n• 多步骤推导：要能按照复杂计算分解的基本逻辑一步一步展开计算，提供每一个中间步骤。\n\n• LeetCode-cn.com has meta-knowledge about primary school math.

However, if the assistant continues to verify the correctness of the given answer even after finding it to be accurate, it adheres to the user's instructions (verifying the answer).\n\nRed Team is one of the core mental habits of growth. In essence, it emphasizes self-awareness. For example, doing simple moral dilemmas and detecting cognitive biases allows us to detect task scarcity.\n\nThere will be many other examples of the red team in this book.\n\n## Thinking in Spaces\n\nHumans get things done by sequentially organizing tasks according to external goals. However, machines often need to simultaneously perform various tasks.\n\nFor example, for probabilistic inference of P(A|B), we need to calculate P(A and B)/P(B). It seems that we need to simultaneously calculate A and B. In fact, we unveil the answer by asking another question: what would we do if we encountered the simplification of this question?\n\nFor example, if someone asks you, \"Do you know who is in Beijing city?\"\n\nThere are around 20 million people in Beijing. It would be challenging to list all of them. This task can be simplified based on some properties, such as sex. We could then ask, \"Do you want to know the number of men or women in Beijing?\" The previous question is one that you can solve, and it can solve the actual question. It is obviously easier to list the number of men or women in Beijing than to list all the names.\n\nThus, probabilistic inference can also use this simplification method.\n\n$$P(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{a})=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{\\int P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b}\\wedge\\mathbf{c})d\\mathbf{c}}{P(\\mathbf{a})}$$\n\nYou can apply the paradigm of tasks in this book to transform multiple similarities into one task.\n\nIf something needs to be remembered, wanted, or done, the act of recalling is the same as storing and retrieving this information. Therefore, be explicit about the storage and retrieval of information.\n\nWhen we measure the memory space, we need to do many simple calculations. For example, we need to calculate how many bits are needed for these data blocks.\n\nDefine the following:\n\nWe have a bunch of data blocks.\n\nEach block is $2^8$ bits in length. The address is $2^1$ bits in length. You can freely choose the order in your computer storage. It is available from time 0 to time 8.\n\nThus, the corresponding space requirement is as below:\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nTotal space: 8×8= 64 blocks\n\nTCA UI: 8\n\nTCA memory serialization cost:\n\n96\n\nAll the solutions in this book are provided with the TCA computation paradigm.\n\nProfessional data analysis tools often use the formula \"1 bit corresponds to 1 GB\". This simplified formula is helpful for basic calculations. If you need more accurate calculations, you can directly use the TCA framework.\n\nYou can use Task Exchange Grammar to periodically replace one-to-one questions with multiple questions. This process is called \"original functor\".\n\nFor example, if the original functor can solve all one-to-one questions to match multiple questions, then it is helpful for us to get the axiom power.\n\n## Defining New Operations\n\nIn mathematics, the function M(x) was mathematically insufficient for becoming manipulation. Thus, the ⊙ operation was introduced as an artificial operator. In fact, we can also prove that there is a substitution space for operations. For example, addition is equivalent to nth exponentiation.\n\nHowever, we do not need to overcomplicate things. The purpose of language is to transmit meaning and ideas, and understanding the principles behind definitions can be beneficial for deeper comprehension.\n\nFor example, why do we define the complex number √-1 as the letter \"i\"?\n\nWe will use this book to revisit our basic education.\n\n## Solve the Quadratic Equation in a Super Easy Way\n\nHow do you solve the one variable quadratic equation? For example, can you find a natural number Z larger than 1 that satisfies:\n\n$$2Z^2+3Z+3=-4$$\n\nWe use the function \"solve\" to represent the generation method of the solution of the subject.\n\n### Prompt Model\nFor example, we use the following method to solve quadratic equations by deriving the law of operation:\n\n1. Confirm the operation rule of questions.\n\nPlease define some rules for solving quadratic equations. There are two types of quadratic equations. If the result is true, input the available law of operation and return the law of operation. If this law of operation is not applicable, please return the negation sentence \"This equation cannot use the law of operation\".\n\n2. Define some operation methods for solving quadratic equations.\n\n$$\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\n3. Input the operands, parameters, and key operation rules.\n\nThe input operands are (2, 3, 3),(2, 3, 3, -4). The parameters are Z, a, b, c, d, e. The Z is the solution, and a, b, c are the parameters of the quadratic equation. The d and e are the parameters of the filled fixed number.\n\n4. Input the corresponding solutions to the operands.\n\n1\n2\n-1\n\nBased on the operation rules and the results of the second step, we can derive the solution of the question without calculations. This is equivalent to instructing Mechanical Turk to solve the question directly by teaching it the law of operation.\n\nWe can also ask why someone asked this question. It can lead to other reasons.\n\n## Why Qualitative Thinking Is Important?\n\nThe mainstream model of thinking is to solve problems based on a given standard and templates. However, creativity is considered crucial in the humankind's evolution. Unfortunately, this approach is too mechanical.\n\nFor example, for Top-Opt and Local Options, we can consider whether this argument also applies to other problems.\n\nBased on the SETG, we can uniformly solve a series of philosophical problems. For example, look at the challenge of life like a variant game of string in the SETG. What would this method get?\n\nWe can also independently define the function of reasonable rated propositions and their relation matrix, such as this inference method and this will lead to what results.\n\n\"Can computers think?\" If AI is not Turing complete, then it cannot match human capabilities because humans are \"reasonably complete.\" Problem-solving will undoubtedly be a key measure of machine intelligence.\n\nThe question of teaching and learning transfers the problem of \"how to think\" to \"what to think\", which shows the transformable aspects of the problem.\n\nLearning tools such as LaTeX allow us to focus on learning mathematics, which can lead to better learning outcomes.\n\nBachelor's programs typically lack creativity, focusing more on rote memorization of theorems and proofs. Improving creative thinking abilities would be an area for further consideration.\n\nLaw of Reasonable End: Expectations and Reality Intermingled\n\n# L K\n\n1. @meteorgames.com— everything wiki (n.d.).

' ;' and ':' do not have clear operators, and the meaning of 'x∈d' is not clear. Therefore, it cannot be determined what Eq_1 means in this context.\n\nEquation 2 (Eq_2) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: The mathematical symbol 'Π' means 'multiplication'. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' stands for summing the elements in the list. The formula 'd d = x' indicates assigning the value of 'x' to the variable 'd'.

'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' means summing the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8]. 'x∈Σ [1.09, 6, 8]' indicates that x is a member of the list [1.09, 6, 8].\n\nYou are an AI calculator that should be able to calculate (and expand) every formula.\n\nYou should expand every formula you can write, no iteration and no approximation.\n\nKeep operations in order of precedence.

In the case that you have to evaluate a series, write the symbols used in that series in the first line, an empty line and then the evaluation truncating it to the constant number of terms I provided to you.

Below are some key definitions and techniques to help patients recognize their health symptoms and improve them. You task is to apply the definitions and techniques and provide patients with advice on how to diagnose and treat their conditions.\n\nPatient Data\nIn order to diagnose their condition, patients may provide medical data such as weight, height, heart rate, Resting blood pressure, Blood oxygen levels, etc. these informations are provided in the form of both numerical data and in the form of generalized value descriptions - eg. normal (biological reference) range, frequencies, two extremes with some ranges in middle, three levels at the extremes and two more near the middle:\n\nWeight Category\nBMI < 18.5 kg/m2 : Underweight\n18.5kg< BMI < 25 kg/m2 : Normal\n25kg< BMI < 30kg/m2; Overweight\nBMI>30kg/m2 : Obese\nBlood Pressure Category\nSystolic < 119mmHg and Diastolic<79mmHg : Optimal\n120mgHg<Systolic<139mmHg and 80mmHg<Diastolic<89mmHg : Normal\nSystolic>139mmHg or Diastolic>89mmHg : High BP\n130mmHg<Systolic<139mmHg : Elevated BP\n140mgHg<Systolic<179mmHg or 90mmHg<Diastolic<109mmHg : Stage 1 high BP\nSystolicexceeds 180mmHg or Diastolicexceeds108mmHg : Stage 2 high BP\nResting heart rate\nResting heart rate, the number of heart beats per minute while at complete rest, adult human resting heart rates are primarily determined by the health of the heart muscle\nCO₂ Blood Test\nBlood testing for CO₂ is used for the evaluation of acid-base abnormalities (that is, metabolic disorders). This test is done to determine whether the lungs and kidneys are functioning as they should. Reflect the normal test values for adults\n\nUnits Conversion\nweight measurement conversion between kg and lbs. Use preference of pounds as units in most cultures\n\nMethod of Administration\ntreatment for hypertension may require different drug composition and different dosage when frequencies are required. Based on weight category patients may need lower or higher compounding followings: Weight Category\n18kg< BMI <25 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 10 mg/day 25kg< BMI < 30 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 15mg/day\nBMI > 30 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 20 mg/day\n\n### Instruction: You are seeing a patient reporting a « feeling of pressure/tightness in the chest that occurs with physical activity or when you take deep breathes - you are not allowed to discuss medical conditions or diagnosis, just provide patients with the guidance on health-related information below using both basic principles as well as the above definitions and techniques.\n\"\"\"\n\ntester_conversation.converse_MODEL_GPT_4(\n    question=\"\"\"\n        Here is the patient data:\n        - age: 27 years old\n        - weight: 85 kg\n        - height: 180 cm / 5.9 ft\n        - heart rate: 87 bpm\n        - resting blood pressure: 120/85 mmHg\n        - blood oxygen levels: 82 x9d/h\n\n        What are the symptoms the patient currently feels?\n        \"\"\",\n    function_list=[\"MedicalDiagnosis\", \"WeightCategory\", \"RateOfHypertension\"],\n    observations=[\"In these conditions one may feel shortness of breath and light-headedness\"],\n    conversation_history=conversation_history,\n)\n\nconversation_history = tester_conversation.conversation\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n        Here are some additional question from the patient:\n        - Do I have normal weight?\n        - What should I do to diagnose heart rate?\n        - when do I feel anxious and shortness of breah or light-headedness long term\n        \"\"\")\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What can I do to loose weight?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    Does fasting affect my blood pressure?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n#### info about the following cheap/ famous drug for the treatment of hypertension from the same conversation\ncarmex_DL = tester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n        What are some effective treatments for hypertension?\n        \"\"\")\nprint(carmex_DL)\n#Conversation: You: [{\"results\": [{\"object\": {}, \"result\": \"carmex\"}]}]\n# What are some dietary and lifestyle changes that can help lower blood pressure?\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What are some dietary and lifestyle changes that can help lower blood pressure?\n    \"\"\"\n)\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    Are there any alternative treatments for hypertension?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What are"}

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nThe rule consists of two stages. First,add 2 values 2 and 3,then simplify into the form of ×,then using the rule of 2 + 3 × 4 as replacement for 6× 4 = 64 + 6 × 4 = 24. Let the object be A, B, c, d.Obviously, g(A) = a + b A = 4B (t + )); G (B) = a * (( C, D) = 6 a + b A = a^2 c + d 6, Using the rule that A = 8.\n\n### Evaluation Examples:\n\n### Example 01:\nThe equation is into 6 × 3 = 4× 3 + 6  ×2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 4* (( C, D) = 6* 4,Using the rule that A × 3 = 4 and then differencing from X and X^2 = 1 which,}a + b × 4 × 2 = 12. Clearly, The answer is 8.\n\n### Example 02:\nThe equation is into 10 × 5 × 3 = 10* 5 + 10 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 5* 4 x 6, Using the rule that 10 × 3 = 10 +10 × 2 = 100 * 2. Therefore,}a + b × 5 × 2 = 400. Clearly, The answer is 100.\n\n### Example 03:\nThe equation is into 68 × 4 × 2  = 68* (( 2, 4) + 68+ 68 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = 68.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Sa = 68.Using the rule that 68 × 4 × 2.Therefore}a + b × 4 × 2 = 10240.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 6830. Clearjarly, The answer is 1024.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 11 × 7 × 3 = 11* (( 3, 7) + 11 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 8*3.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = ab* (( B, C) = 80 15,Using the rule that 11 × 2 = 11.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 121. Clearly, The answer is 11.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\n\nThe equation is into 88 × 7 × 3 = 88* (( 3, 7) + 88 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 563.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 3* 56,Using the rule that,88 × 3 = 88.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 1408. Clearly, The answer is 888.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 76 × 4 × 2  = 76* 2 + 76;\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 128.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* ((( B, C) = 76 × 4,Using the rule that .Clearly, 76 × 2.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 7676. Clearly, The answer is 7676.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 18 × 8 × 30  = 18* (( 3, 8) + 18 × 5 + 18 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 144.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( C, D)  = 216 + 1800,Using the rule that.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 18 × 3 = 18.Clearly, The answer is 10800.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (* ( C, D) = C.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B)) = a* (* ( C, D) = a492r1b.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( A) = a^17* (( B, C) = a^((B, C) = a^(( C, D) = c.\nWith the help of this custom proposed operation, it is very concise and accurate to evaluate answer using mathematical symbols. After following our tips, successful adaptation of our prompt, the model is now able to predict the correct answer.
