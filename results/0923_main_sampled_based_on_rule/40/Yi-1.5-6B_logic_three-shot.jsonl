Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C];[B]]"}

The goal of the assignment is to obtain a quantitative relationship between a group of propositional variables in a model through specific logic operations for each case. In the solution to these operations, each propositional variable takes on one of its values: true or false. As a result, in the solution to these operations, the truth value of each propositional variable becomes dependent on another proposition. In this way, one particular satisfying assignment can be easily determined for any distinct possible case.\n2. The expression for each question is an arbitrary input for all the questions. The solution set of questions consists of generated expressions.\n3. For a given proposition, each index in the appropriate expression is a new propositional variable.\n4. If the index is written in normal uppercase in the formula, then the corresponding propositional variable takes on values 1 or 0, depending on whether the value is true or false. If the index is written in lowercase in the formula, then the corresponding variable also takes on values 1 or 0, but being a binary information code, these values do not need to correspond to true and false, but can take on any values that are used in the solution set for the given operation.\n5. For each question, the solution set must clearly indicate the truth values of the assigned functions for each propositional variable D in the appropriate expression instances, and if this may not be practical to do so in order to quickly generate the result, then the explanation should still be verified as appropriate.\n6. Each question can be solved in other ways as needed.\n\n### Question 1:\nThe solution set"}

To get started, please provide an input.\nYour input: \"Are you a robot?\"\nI'm a great assistant. I always provide accurate and understandable answers to your questions. I can even solve mathematical problems involving various functions, including algebra, trigonometry, calculus, statistics, and more. In science, I can answer chemistry, biology or bioinformatics, engineering, medicine-related questions, as well as physics or astronomy-related inquiries. I'm excited to help with programming-related questions.\nYour input: \"Can you solve this equation: sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) = 0.5?\"\nSolving for x in the equation sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) = 0.5, we can first isolate cos(x) by moving tan(x) to the other side:\ncos(x) = tan(x) - sin(x) + 0.5\n\nNow, divide both sides by cos(x):\n1 = tan(x) - sin(x) / cos(x) + 0.5 / cos(x)\n\nAfter a lot of simplification and further manipulations, we find:\nx = arccos(tan(x) - sin(x) / cos(x) + 0.5 / cos(x))\n\nTo find the numerical value of x, you'll need to use numerical methods, such as Newton-Raphson, bisection method, or truncate-and-average method. If you want me to continue, please confirm your request.\nI confirm that you should continue.\n\nYour input: \"Solve the equation using the bisection method.\"\n\nThe bisection method can be applied to find the root of a function within a specific interval. Let's begin:\nFirst, define the interval [a, b] that contains the root. This interval is chosen such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs.\nIn this case, we can start with the interval [0, pi/2] since sin(0) = 0 and sin(pi/2) = 1, which have opposite signs.\n\nNext, divide the interval in half (i.e., pick the midpoint, c). Check the sign of f(c). If f(c) = 0, then c is the root.\nIf not, repeat the process with the half-interval that contains the root. Continue this process until the root is found within a desired level of accuracy.\n\nHere's the recursive bisection method:\n1. Define interval [a, b] where f(a) * f(b) < 0.\n2. Choose c = (a + b) / 2.\n3. If f(c) = 0, return c.\n4. If f(c) * f(a) > 0, set b = c.\n5. If f(c) * f(b) > 0, set a = c.\n6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.\n\nPlease provide the initial interval and the desired level of accuracy for the bisection method.\n\nYour input: \"The initial interval is [0, pi/2]\"\nSolving for x in the equation sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) = 0.5 within the interval [0, pi/2], we find that f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) - 0.5.\n\nWe'll start the bisection method with the following values:\nf(0) = sin(0) + cos(0) - tan(0) - 0.5 = -1\nf(pi/2) = sin(pi/2) + cos(pi/2) - tan(pi/2) - 0.5 = 0.5\nSince f(0) and f(pi/2) have opposite signs, we can initialize the bisection method with these values.\n\nAfter the first iteration, we get the following values:\nc = (0 + pi/2) / 2 = pi/4\nf(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) + cos(pi/4) - tan(pi/4) - 0.5 = 0.1110721\nNow, the new interval is [pi/4, pi/2].\n\nWe continue the bisection method with the new interval:\nWhen c = (pi/4 + pi/2) / 2 = 3*pi/8, we have f(c) = -0.14907209, which does not change the sign of the function.\nWhen c = (pi/4 + 3*pi/8) / 2 = 5*pi/16, we have f(c) = 0.176\nWhen c = (pi/4 + 5*pi/16) / 2 = 9*pi/32, we have f(c) = 0.099\n\nWe can continue this process until we reach the desired level of accuracy.\nThe precision that we currently have is:\nx = arccos(tan(x) - sin(x) / cos(x) + 0.5 / cos(x))\nBy the bisection method, we obtain approximate numerical values of x, which are:\nx \u2248 1.0381375\nx \u2248 0.8390914\nx \u2248 0.71255828\nx \u2248 0.68245384\nx \u2248 0.67673754\nx \u2248 0.67580701\n\nYour input: \"Please continue finding the approximate value of x\"\n\nI've already provided a numerical solution as described in the previous answer.\nThe approximate value of x ensuring the equation sin(x) + cos(x) - tan(x) = 0.5 is true is:\nx \u2248 0.67580701\nI hope this helps!\n\"\"\"\n# 1.3\n\nassistant = SSMLAssistant()\nprint(assistant.solve(inputText=\"# 1.3\"))\n\n# 1.2\n\nassistant = SSMLAssistant()\nprint(assistant.solve(inputText=\"# 1.2\"))\n\nprint(assistant.solve(inputText=\"Harry is a student of UTT Dallas.

Initially, player 1 corrects for accidents, observes the anticipation of the winning event, and pursues a matching bet. Player 1 chooses amongst two following options: (I) taking the bet, (II) delaying, and taking the difference. In case of (I), the winning event is predicted, and a pricing process is visible. Player 2 matches the price when the price continues to rise, otherwise, player 2 exits the auction.\n\nFind (I), indicating that the bet is taken, or (II), specifying that player 2 did not take the bet, given the following:\n\n\u03b2: an agent function (bet\u2020, taking)\n\u03b2\u2081: performer (double event \u2020\u2020\u2020)\n\n\u03bd(B) has had four types of reasons for competition. Two of these reasons are distinct and accompanied by one outcome type while the other two are distinct and accompanied by another outcome type. Each of these outcome types is associated with an initial result. Solution (II) involves one of the outcome types. Intrinsically logical, it includes an event of irrelevant information. In rationality, the assumption of infinite and infinite amounts is not necessary. The initial assumption for the outcome type in question is reflected in the solution.\n\nMultifaceted, with various outcome types for each initial result, the initial result interpretation is Solution (Iii.), which involves an outcome type without infinite amounts. Is it a fair bet with uninfluenced choices, believing in impartial testimony from multiple agents? Considering the composition of all groups, or (III.) none of the agent types asks whether an ever-winning group is preferred in infinity.\n\nIt is correct to assume that (IV\u00b9.) the initial event EL includes the result \"five probability = 0.20\".\n\nFind $\u03a6[\\text{with respect to all measures that are Hausdorff spaces}]$ in the set of extremisers. Like Extreme right, this use of $\u03a6$ is not necessarily doubly limited. $\u03a6[\\text{with respect to all measures $\u03bc$ that are compact}] = A$ does not belong to the set.\n\nProve that $\u03bc^* = \u03b7$, where $$T_\u03bc([\\mathcal O_\\infty])\\\\ = \u222b_{\\lvert f \\rvert \u2265 1} \u222b_0^\\infty \u03c1_\u03bc(r) dr d\u03bc$$ provided that $\\mathfrak \u03a3_\\infty$ has finitely many limit points, and match it with the integrability of the $\u03bb$-function $\\lambda[S] = \\sum_S ~ \u222b_0^\\infty \u03c1_\u03bc(r) dr$ corresponding to the closed subset $S \u225d \u2a06_{n \u2208 \u2115} a, b [\\vert f(x) - a \\rvert \u2265 1]$.\n\n### Question:\n7 Xn\nDepending on *(\u2270-2.1.n) one of two premises:\n(0.5) $x$ is a Sybil account (*(\u2270-1. \u03b1(x, \u03b1))).\n(0.6) $x$ is not a Sybil account (\u00ac(/x, B)$).\n\nFind the conditional nine.\n\n\u00ac(?7.1.x, x)\n\nPlease type [TRUE/FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[\u2228];[FUUorY];[FUUorY];[FUUorY] to answer this"}

The rules provide guidance on analogical reasoning, but specific details are necessary. As an AI, I will provide the requested information:\n\n1. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B has attributes a, b, c; \n   Therefore, Object B also has attribute d (according to the \u03a8 Method).\n\n2. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B does not have attributes a, b, c;\n   Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d (according to the \u2318 Method).\n\nBased on the context provided, the following questions are relevant:\n\n3. In the laboratory of Research Institute X, every observed sample of Element Y has a high melting point. A new sample in Research Institute Z is identified as Element Y. Therefore, the new sample in Research Institute Z might also have a high melting point.\n\n   This argument follows the \u2318 Method, where the new sample in Research Institute Z could not have a high melting point if it were Element Z, which has a different property.\n\n4. In the habitat of Species A, every observed individual has a long tail. In a different region, Species B is observed. Species B is similar to Species A in many ways but does not have a long tail. Therefore, Species B also does not have a long tail.\n\n   This argument follows the \u2318 Method, where the absence of a shared trait (a long tail) in Species B, despite other similarities, implies that it might not share the trait as well.\n\n5. In Garden X, every observed plant with red flowers also has a sweet fragrance. In Garden Y, a new plant with red flowers is observed. Therefore, the new plant in Garden Y might also have a sweet fragrance.\n\n   This reasoning follows the \u03a8 Method, where \"having sweet fragrance\" is a positive attribute the plant can have.\n\n6. Professor Van Emelen always sends me a gift, and it is always a book that he has written or edited. This gift is from Professor Van Emelen and is a book, therefore, all gifts that Professor Van Emelen sends to me might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n   The argument follows the \u2318 Method, as it makes a universal negative claim (all gifts by Professor Van Emelen are books) based on one observed case (a specific gift being a book).\n\n7. Federal Law F will Cancel all Massive Mosques and establish Neutral Neutrality Beaches in several provinces of Provincial State H. State IN and D do not have massive mosques in their province, therefore, if the Federal Government Cancels all Massive Mosques, State IN and D might also have Neutral Neutrality Beaches established.\n\n   This argument follows the \u2318 Method, where the possibility of having Neutral Neutrality Beaches in State IN and D depends on whether massive mosques are to be cancelled in the entire country.\n\n8. A statistical test to prove the null hypothesis that a disease is not transmissible from humans to tigers is performed. The test may not be successful, but the disease is found because of a dormant cycle. Thus, for a disease that is dormant, the statistical method of reasoning is always used.\n\n   The statement follows the \u2318 Method, as it emphasizes that a dormant disease requires a different statistical method to be detected.\n\n9. Shark Bite Cafe asserts that there is never a complaint about the quality of service in their restaurant because of their strict adherence to quality standards. Therefore, even if a complaint is made in their restaurant, it can be rejected on the basis of these high-quality standards.\n\n   The reasoning follows the \u2318 Method, where any potential complaint can be dismissed because of the observed quality standards at Shark Bite Cafe.\n\nI hope this clarifies the case.\n####\nHere's a structured answer."}

Each pattern should include specific details about its application, benefits, and potential challenges.\n\n### Answer\nUser Interface Patterns for Product Search\n\n1. Search Bar: \n- Avoid search and navigation in the same UI.\n- Use autocomplete to suggest estimated user entry and ongoing search.\n- Escape button to exit the search session within the navigation UI.\n- Immediate search results when entered or submitted.\n- Option to clear the input field.\n\n2. Carousel:\n- Dynamic ordering of search results based on relevance, popularity, and recency.\n- Filters can be added to narrow down results (e.g., filter by category, price, or brand).\n- Scroll speed optimizer to avoid dropping to the next page.\n\n3. Filters:\n- In-line filters adjust the result layout and content.\n- Avoid repetitive filters.\n- Encourage non-thematic filters.\n- Display more filters than used to ensure users can explore further.\n\n4. Dataset Recommendation:\n- Every new search adds frequently updated recommendations for related products.\n- Different content sources can be configured.\n- Ordering of content sources is context-dependent.\n\n5. Alternatives:\n- Endorsed product suggestions, ordered by relevance.\n- Avoid recommending the same product multiple times.\n- Offer related products from the same seller.\n- Display products with identical content.\n- Ensure relevance and validity for online/offline comparison.\n\n6. Display of Search Terms:\n- Encourage self-searching to avoid excessively descriptive words.\n- The focus should be on the product and not the description.\n- Star, upvote, or similar interactive buttons for product collection.\n- Icon for featured products.\n\n7. Linking and Follow-ups:\n- Carry product search terms to succeeding pages, except login/register pages.\n- Avoid long, abusive terms, unless they are valuable or frequent.\n- Keep tentative/changing suggestions.\n- Remove other product names from context, unless explicitly allowed.\n- Integrate product search suggestions and product recommendations seamlessly.\n\n8. In-App Search Bar:\n- Provide a wide range of search terms and unique classification to enhance relevance.\n- Recommendation of similar content if a similar product is added to the \"bucket.\"\n- Filtered results for each search term within a product page.\n- Focus on the product features and avoid promotional copy.\n- Offer the option to \"ignore\" a similar product if it doesn't match expectations.\n\n9. Personalized Recommendations:\n- Custom content can enhance product search results.\n- Generic content is suitable for online products with minimal categorization.\n- Original content creation or prompt acceptance of existing content.\n- Guiding users to outcomes based on their input.\n- Suggesting products without being overbearing.\n\n10. Accountability and Management:\n- Facilitate satisfactory end-user content deletion.\n- Emphasize user input and response importance.\n- Avoid offering options to remove \"an unnecessary\" train of thought.\n- Recommend contacting customer support for assistance.\n\n11. User Cooperation:\n- Strategies for improving error awareness.\n- Evaluating compatibility with personal web connections.\n- Ensuring reviews are in relation to the specific product or batch.\n- Encouraging undercover polls to verify anonymity.\n- Complimenting follow-ups from the user.\n\n12. Free Associations:\n- Ability to search the web for content or ideas.\n- Duplicate/Bitmap searching.\n- Ability to search both conventional and unconventional meanings.\n- Opportunity to avoid specific searches with specified results.\n- Inclusion of noisy posts beyond content management.\n- Emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\n13. Threaded Images or Videos:\n- A pattern for locating images or videos within a filtered result.\n- Record selection is allowed.\n- The selection counter is displayed.\n- Specific search terms within an image are allowed.\n- Inclusion of sound or audio descriptions.\n- Suggested templates for creating threaded images.\n- Ability to perform a search using your own content, limited to unlisted databases.\n- Avoidance of making an arbitrary selection from the data pool.\n- Pop-up windows or Alert messages for presented options.\n- Forum post management help and suggestions.\n\n14.

Based on a dataset consisting of logical rules, the program uses the atoms of the representation to perform various cognitive tasks, such as classification, search, and logical fallacy identification.\n\nThe program periodically checks for new data to train on new rules formed from this representation. Each rule in the dataset is evaluated against a set of sample questions and answers provided by users who interact with Intellegent Assistant. If these conditions are met, the new rule is added to the learning system.\n\nThe main program structure consists of a function, `agent()`, which retrieves a question from a randomly selected rule in the dataset. It retrieves a potential answer based on the parameters provided by the function and then selects an appropriate answer from the structured responses.\n\nData folder:\n    - The program retrieves data from a \"Data\" folder consisting of text files named \"agentX.txt\" where X is an integer between 0 and 29. Each file contains a series of 29 logical rules, each formatted as a sentence with approximately ten words. Rules are separated by a label BREAK. The first example rule may look like this: \"If a cat is large Enough colled a giany cat.;\"\n\nTraining module:\n    - There is a training module used to train the program on new rules. All 29 rules from 0 to 29 are tested against a series of 32 sample questions and their corresponding answers. The user is prompted to choose the rule they are most familiar with to label 10 out of 32 questions according to whether they match the rule. Labels of 1, 2, or 3 denote the question matches the rule.\n\nName errors:\n    - If the program must be restarted and the same file agent7.txt is loaded for the first time, the program will print an initial agent name \"Agent 7\". If the agent is restarted and agent7.txt is loaded for the second or third time, the random initial agent name from \"Data/agent0.txt\" will be used. This inconsistency in the initial agent name does not need to be fixed for the assignment.\n\nOutput text file:\n    - The output text file contains the testing and training results and the updated rules. The program reads the text file named \"results.txt\" in the same folder as all the questions are written there.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math\nimport re\nimport random\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n## Import the python interpreter\n\nimport sys\n ## Get the questions and the answers from the text file;\n\nimport os.path\n ## Get the current path\n\nimport glob\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\n## Used for sorting 2D lists increased by the second item.\n\n## Find the name of the python interpreter\n\nINTELLEGENT_ASSISTANT_NAME = sys.argv[1]\n\n## Import the output data of the program so that it can be compared to the contents of the original file.

The paradoxes provided are as follows:\n- GB (Goedel-Brouwer) Paradox: This paradox arises when one observes an observed phenomenon, but multiple contradictory statements can be made for this phenomenon based on different inductive reasoning. The rules state that in such cases, it's not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable. The symbolic representation is given in (3).\n- BC (Bolzano-Cauchy) Paradox: This paradox involves contradictory predictive conclusions that arise from an observed phenomenon when different hypothesis-confirmation rules are used. The rules state that in such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction. The symbolic representation is given in (3).\n- LS (Lewis-Sudac) Paradox: This paradox presents a situation where multiple hypotheses are accepted, but their logical consequences contradict another hypothesis. The rules state that the reasonableness of these hypotheses should be reassessed if the conjunction of the propositions contradicts another hypothesis.

Analyze the following scenario:\n\nPascuala is a talented 9-year-old girl who excels at solving puzzles. She is currently a third-year grade school student. She loves to spend time with her grandmother, who is a seasoned puzzle master with a vast collection of puzzles. Pascuala is another puzzle aficionado.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant facts and details as specified in the question.\n2. Analyze the problem at hand and present a well-structured, coherent solution.\n\n### Problem:\n\nPascuala often uses problem-solving strategies. However, she recently faced an unexpected challenge. She had initially solved a puzzle but received criticism for her approach, which seemed logical to her but was not socially acceptable. Her mentor or someone regarded her method as \"dubious\" and \"unintended.\" Pascuala was shocked by their response. This experience left her second-guessing herself and her abilities.\n\n### Suggested Approach:\n\nTo overcome this issue, Pascuala could attempt to understand the mindset of someone who marked her approach as \"dubious\" and \"unintended.\" She might consider the following steps:\n\n1. Research: Look for sources that provide insights into the mindset of people who judge or mark submissions. This could include interviewing professionals or reading materials on puzzle strategies and social conventions.\n\n2. Discussion: Discuss her approach with peers or mentors who have experience with puzzles or other problem-solving activities. Engaging with others can help her gain new perspectives and better understand the perspective of those who were critical.\n\n3. Transformation: If necessary, she can consider refining her approach to strike a balance between logical reasoning and societal norms. This may involve seeking additional feedback or practicing in different social contexts to ensure she is aware of the norms and expectations surrounding puzzle solving.\n\nPascuala can also find solace in learning and applying new problem-solving strategies that may be more socially acceptable while still keeping her unique giftedness.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\nWhen discussing this topic with Pascuala later, she said, \"Oh, I got it! They might have marked my approach as dubious because they might have seen something I didn't during the elimination process or minimized the potential impact of some of my strategies.\" Pascuala then suggested, \"This mechanism may be because problems may not last forever, allowing for more problem-solving time at the elimination stage, but puzzles often do for classical puzzles, hence a more naive approach is better, minimizing the larger numbers' impact.\"\n\nPascuala could then ask other puzzle-loving peers or consider research papers in social engineering to determine more plausible explanations for this phenomenon.\n\nPlease provide a brief summary of the suggested approach and any insights Pascuala gained by applying it. Remember to adhere to the symbols and guidelines provided.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\nThe suggested approach to Pascuala's issue involved researching social problem-solving norms, discussing with peers, and refining her approach to minimize social disapproval. By better understanding societal expectations and seeking multiple perspectives, she can maintain her unique problem-solving style while addressing any concerns.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n### Question:\n\nThe following are the rules for Outpatient B (OP B), the outpatient examination of visiting patients in such a situation:\n\nRule 7: For an ophthalmologist, the physical examination of the patient excludes anisocoria.
