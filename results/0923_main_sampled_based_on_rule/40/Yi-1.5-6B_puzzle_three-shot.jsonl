For 'remiss' it is going to be the case we check if the answer is longer than 8. repeat goes to 5, remiss goes to 8. So we just look at its length and see are there any combinations with equal length. repeat has 4 characters and remiss has 6 characters so we engage quionrd and begin looking for them.''',\n\n600:-1,\n## 600:-1\n]"}

Your goal is to apply the rule accurately and present the output as required.\n\nThe first task is to complete the variable/value pair based on the given rule, which is to add a common prefix in front of the provided letter combinations and make it a word. The input for this task is \"arti un\", and the output should be formed by adding the prefix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe second task is similar, where you need to add a common suffix in front of the given letter combinations and form a word. The input for this task \"bicy\", and the output should be formed by adding the suffix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe rule is the same, except the task is now to remove a common prefix from the input words and make a word. This means you will have to figure out which letter combination serves as the common prefix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe fourth task is to remove a common suffix. Similar to the previous task, you will need to determine which letter combination serves as the common suffix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe final task is to swap the first letter of the input words with their third letter. This means you will need to identify which letter is the first letter and which letter is the third letter, and then manipulate the word accordingly.\n\nFor the rules, I've provided example letter combinations involving prefixes and suffixes, so you can see what the expected output should look like and how to apply the rule accurately. For the inputs, you will need to identify the word that represents the common prefix or suffix and apply the rule accordingly. For the \"ring\", you will need to apply the rule by manipulating the accent, which is the second letter, to match the position of the first letter in the given word.\n\nRemember, accurate application of the rule is essential for solving these problems. If you need any more guidance, let me know. I hope this helps!"}

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test!

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\""}

It asks you to provide the explicit values of each letter in the sequence \"HI + LO = MID\" using the rule that no two letters can represent the same number.\n\nTo solve this question accurately, we apply the provided rule to the given question. We start by assigning a unique number from 0-9 to each letter in the sequence, ensuring that different letters do not represent the same number. We then combine the values of \"HI\" and subtract the value of \"LO\" from the value of \"MID.\" This gives us an equation of 7+8-3=5, which confirms that the application of the rule to the question is correct.\n\nOverall, the answer is accurate in connecting the rule to the question and ensuring that the letter-number values adhere to the given rule.\n\nThe question leaves a green checkmark (check here) next to the provided answer and a comment agreeing with it. Although the question and answer are technically grammatically correct, they lack context and clarity necessary for comprehensibility.

The player aims to construct walls that separate these islands, following the constraints outlined in the puzzle's rule. The goal is to output the drawn matrix, which contains the elements and numbers, in a specified format.\n\nThe provided Python 3.6 code snippet demonstrates a functional approach to solving this puzzle.\nIt created variables for the puzzle grid, like \"row_count\" and \"col_count\", and initialized the result string with appropriate characters to represent boundaries between islands and within walls.\nWith the introduction of linked lists and linear search, an algorithm was created to identify vacant island positions and create walls around them.\nThe puzzle's rule was ingested, and the result was validated, optimized, and transformed based on the assessment.\n\n### References:\n\n1.

I think in problem description the fifth rule says the adjacent stars should not be same plane.\nCan you give more description regarding the 5th rule. My soln has failed the first round. I was just interpreting rule 5 as the presence of 2 stars on a same line is allowed but they should not be in a same plane.\n\nYes. That's the correct way to think of it. If you want to find more information about this specific puzzle, you can refer to the following resources:\n1. Link to question 7\n2. Link to question 8\n\nby Sajal Kumar\nI'm only solving for fun so my submition is not perfect so I will share some thought:\nfor now , all the grids are connected thus stars cannot touch at point,i.e they are required to be placed in different lines,if I recall correctly the grids were always created with odd number of rows/colums\n\nfrom here on out we start making assumptions to handle corner cases and weird border cases.\nTo handle the borders , we cut the matrix into isolated regions and solve separately and then connect them with edges,wherever the edge is need extra columns/rows ,we will put  custom stars that we will replace with normal stars once we solve the center of borders\n\n1. handling top/bottom bars,  use case :case 5 ,6,7,8,17.\nhandle bottom bar case by putting it at bottom thus top will be empty space.you should put stars on top instead of matrix gap and the bottom one should be pushed to matrix start.\nwidth of each bar :\nwidth of empty space (width-1) + width of each stars (2)*(number of stars per row)*(total rows - height of each bar) + sum of(width of each empty first column)*(number of stars per row - 1)*(total rows - height of each bar)\n\nif case 7 ,8 ,17 has only one bar , we will need to add ,10,14,15 stars respectively except for 14 but its also guaranteed. we will handle it during matrix layout ,but let's keep track of them anyway\n\n2. handling left/right bars,  use case :case 3 , 4 ,10,11.\nRL(%=n here) is number of rows and cols involved in x bar(name of number will be) ,(n-RL) is the number of cols/rows remaining.\nRL = width/(2*(n - RL))\n√RL is height of each x bar.steps of layout:\n1.upper left\n2.right most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at right most side.\n3.lower left\n4.left most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at left most side.\n\n3. how to place some weird cases where RL is not a perfect square number.\nnumber of rows :\nindependent number of columns :√(k * RL) + 1 - n\n% if (k/RL) is not exact . and k is number of stars , RL is width , number of rows is n for this row\n\nthus number of columns in a weird layer(force to be perfect square to find stars) will be :√n + 1 - n just like everything fitting in weird layer's corner.\n\n4. solve the stars at weird bar.map_row :number of the bar and map_solns number of stars to check.\nuse cases:5,6,7,8,11,12,17\nreminder :weird width/{2-width} bar  ma depan ,or gallah,huligan,sukima& tekateka ho cobain - over my comacahto.\nmap_row = (√(RL * (weird_bar_width/2 - width)) + 1 - width)\nmap_col = (√(remaining_cols+map_row-1) + 1 - width)\nmap_solns = √(nr-map_col-1\n\nvalidation:\n\ny_merge -> put stars at very first column even though index is longer than the number of columns ,put empty columns before that\n\nI don't have much idea how to do the column solution so here're my rough gueses\n\n1. k diagrams in a row(2 in hypothetical case of case 1) will be merget i.e merge vertically\n2. same number of diagrams in single row in every vertically merged row.too long...\n3. different number of diagram in each row can be done by count meters in each row :first_other_count_star_number = first_don't_change_starer_number + (count_of_middle_row_merge_star / total_merge_number)*width*(d) , these width(i made typo else) will be equivelent to middle rows width.\n\n***note 1 weird bar will have only one weird solution in the solution of horizontal position so add √(width^2+(2 - width)^2) stars accordingly in the bar.ie.(c)+2+√(width^2-(2-width)^2)\n\nso...\nI will just say stars' column position location will be a bluer k addition the column.blur , k & row farthest kembang location.Sh*t I will added another dimension later if there are more than 2 layers.\nreason:\n(d)imagine every column is a one,two dimensional star.two columns , we will blah blah.\nclosed as Too much effort by Emmanuel Luca\nHii. Iv'e done other puzzles too in this contest and always get the same answer Wrong\n\nIn puzzle 24 put  x(4,2) and there's an empty column.\n```\nOn the star string output, you need to extend to the left though?\nSo your answer should be x(4,1)\n```\nNo. Since the square design doesn't contain blank birds, the column number is not inclusive. ```\nHence, x[4,3] is the last column.\n```\nIs that \"null zones\" are just fun_jobs (i.e. a fun feature in the job's description).@Cokelou\n\nYes. But due to some reasons, we could not put this requirement in the original job description.\n\nThe response link link to by Anonymous The response link is the one to use.\nby Anwar Faiz\nI don't understand the first question 3 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big. You can only use 3 stars. You should write your answer in double square brackets, i.e. [[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)]].\n\nIt has been already mentioned in the first sentence of the description. Note that the \"3\" here does not indicate the number of extra stars that you should use.\ndon't understand the second question 8 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big.
