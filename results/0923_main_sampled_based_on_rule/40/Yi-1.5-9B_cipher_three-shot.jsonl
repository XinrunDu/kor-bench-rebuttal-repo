In this case, if we analyze the first part, it seems like the length of each word corresponds to the positions of the letter ''Q'' in the key. If we move backward in the alphabet, we get a,y,w,z,v,u,t,s,r,q. If we move forward, we get q, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, a. This gives us the answer QUDWLRQ, which corresponds to the first line. If we move downwards, we get XPDK, which corresponds to the second line. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to figure out the entire message, but if you can provide more context, such as the key and other decrypted parts, I can assist you in decrypting it.\n\nIf you're still stuck, we can try to decrypt the message manually using simple substitution ciphers to see if we can understand the message based on the context we have. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed.\n\n### Question:\nCan you decrypt and translate the message, encapsulated in double square brackets? For example, the format should be: [[decrypted and translated message]]\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given decrypt function and the encrypt function, when we use the plaintext 'DECIPHER' and the ciphertext 'DIFBSG', we get the following result. We can observe that 'DECIPHER' is like our plaintext, so our key will be 'STOP'.\n\nCiphertext alphabets:\nRFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\nA replicated ciphertext alphabet is:\nSTOPPRESTOP PRESTOPPREST\n Therefore, we can decrypt the message \"IXXUHQDYUSSL\" into: \"HELLOWORLD\". When you decrypt using the key, \"HELLOWORLD\", \"GETDU SKIP IT\" will be decrypted. Therefore, our final answer is HELLOWORLD.\n\n### Unsolved Cryptic Questions:\n\n#### Original Answer:\nThe basics of Cryptography involve using an algorithm and key, where the key is used to encode data, and the algorithm is used to decode that data.\n\nBy using a unique key or password, encryption helps in protecting data exchange, including confidential information such as credit card or personal identification numbers.\n\nWithout this backend encryption system, electronic transactions would be vulnerable. Encryption also ensures that identities are protected, allowing people to transact safely.\n\nVisual cryptography is an application of visual cryptography, where the secret data is directly embedded into the digital image pixels, making it difficult to decode without special techniques.\n####\n\nEncryption Questions:\n\n1. \"EENCODER GANDALF\" -->  <double-square brackets answer>\n2. \"PLAIN TRICK\"\n3. \"HALF WORD\"\n4. \"GET DUPLICACY\"\n5. \"NEWLIFE TONIGHT\"\n\n#### Original Answer:\nSure, here are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Use the simple substitution cipher technique with the keyword CAR to encrypt the word 'DECIPHER'.\n2. Use the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SMALL' and decrypt the message 'WELCOMEFRIENDS'.\n3. Use the RSA algorithm with the prime number P=7 and the prime number Q=11 to encrypt and decrypt the message 'STEALTHY' using the keys E= 3 and D=47.\n4. Use the Cesar shift cipher with a shift key of 11 to encrypt the message 'YOU ARE THE BESTES'.\n\n#### Original Answer:\nHere are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Apply a modulation-deviation algorithm with key1=127 and key2=78.00 to encrypt the message \"SEXY\".\n2. Perform a Caesar cipher encryption with a numeric key of 17 and a decimal key of 8, and the cipher alphabet remains the same.\n3. Decrypt the given message using the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SEARCH': \"CARNIES HIGH\".\n4.

In Vigenère this is often called a key, whereas in Bellaso it is called a key number. The idea was probably invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso. Vigenère started out his career as a cryptographer in Bellaso's service as a nobleman in Castiglione del Lugduno. Bellaso's method uses n alphabet for the plaintext and string of n alphabets as the key. Then, the plaintext and key are shifted from alphabet to alphabet by number of steps each and its idea relies on positional number system, Caesar encryption, multiple copies of the key, and reciprocal rules.\n\nThe encryption scheme will more complicated than that of the Vignere encryption.\n\nIn this method, successive letters of the key, which may repeat, are used to shift the plaintext letters. Thus, if 'A' is the first letter in the key, 'A' will be the first shift. But if 'B' is the first letter of the key, 'B' will be the shift.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a SINGLE KEYWORD and KEY IS NOT REPEATED, the keyword is used as a \"start letter\" of the multiple copies of the key. You can build out multiple copies of the keyword and use that as the Key to encrypt the plaintext/message.\n\nThe only difference is that you should acknowledge the key alphabet \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" and \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\" for the KEYWORD.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\nEncryption: Convert each character to its key corresponding value.\n\n* Plaintext: \"A HAVFSS ATTACK\"\n* Keyword: \"YOU\"\n\nThese are the steps that are followed when encrypting:\n\n1. Keyword is appended to the plaintext\n2. Keyword is shifted to reach values above KEYING_ORDER. Your current KEYING_ORDER is the keyword\n3. Keyword is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR to make character and frequency comparisons\n4. \"MAX_LOWER_CHAR\" is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR\n5. Maintaining key_lower_char order, index_data is found\n6. Starting from an empty string at first step, indexing pairs is appended to the output string until the last index\n\n* Indexing pairs is the index_data.\n* DefaultMODULUS_NUMBER is the alphabet\n\nThe following is the output string:\n\n* Ciphertext: \"ATZNOGB RJALEZ\"\n\nPlease create the format of the code that follows when converting a single plaintext message into ciphertext (encryption ONLY) and return the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nKUZNACZ_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 8, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\n\n### This is also more complicated than the Vigenere cipher.\n\nThe transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets, the cipher alphabet is shifted cyclically to the left with respect to the plain alphabet. The cipher alphabet may be shifted different amounts for each successive letter.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a keyword and number of wrapping described here:\n# https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E5%93%A8%E5%88%97%E5%8A%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%8D%8F%E7%A4%A2\nbuild a cipher text using the wrapping number and rotation number in the keyword.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\n1. Implement the following steps, in order:\n    1. List all alphabets and put them into an array from A-Z, uppercased.\n    2. Make all letters in keyword uppercased and append Keyword: {keyword} message.\n    3. Make the first character in the wrapped_key uppercased and convert it into rotating code.\n    4. Split the message into chunks, or words separated by spaces.\n    5. Iterate through each word.\n        1. Replace NON-ALPHABETIC characters with space.\n        2. Add \"B\" to the end of the substring.\n        3. Shift substring left by rotating code.\n    6. Iterate through each chunk and rotate the chunk left by rotating code.\n        1. For each chunk, split the chunk into characters and make sure each characters is uppercased.\n        2. For each character in chunk character array, find that upper case character in cipher alphabet array and return that number: ciphertext_key_number, replace the character in the chunk with the letter in cipher alphabet\n\"\"\"\n\nROTOR_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 7, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cipher\n\n### In a hybrid cipher system, letter frequencies and distribution, which make frequency analysis, are maintained in the output. The Edge letter set is manipulated by a scrambler encryption cipher algorithm.\n\n### Rule:\n\nWhen using rotor cipher method to encrypting a plaintext, group the plaintext into a set of characters with length of 5. For instance, \"2HERESTRING\" becomes [\"2HERE\", \"STRING\"].\nThe first character of the first group should be 'R', and the second character of the first group should be 'O'. The first character of the remaining groups should be characters that have not appeared before, and if there are less than 4 characters from the end of the alphabet with characters not appearing before, they will be added at the end of the alphabet in alphabetical order.\nDuplicates of characters in the first group will be dervied from the first group plus the group number.\nFor instance, take the group number 4 and add the number '14R382'. If characters exist between the second character of the first group and the first character of the second group that have not appeared yet, replace the characters of the first group with those characters, then the characters of the second group can be derived from the first character of the second group and the characters that occur four times, for example, it would be 'O15T67R382'.\nThe above sequence of characters represents a mapping of the alphabets. The equivalent char_mapping array can be derived from the mapping string above. The mapping string above is also a way to represent the char mapping (16 pointer array). The two elements of each pair are reversed from the original alphabet order. The pairs have to be ordered from ascending. For a pair, the left element holds the value cipher number and the right element holds the value of plain number, where plain number and cipher number is the number value of a character from a-z plus one. That means that pair(c, n) means that decode(c) = n.\"\"\""}

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

The original alphabet characters are obtained by searching for the letters in the grid at the new coordinates.\n\nExplanation for decryption of Ciphertext \"CMTC\" gives Plain text \"BCDF\". \n\nExplanation: For the decryption of \"CMTC\" (Ciphertext), the corresponding row and column coordinates (2,0)(3,1)(4,3)(3,2) are obtained. These coordinates are divided into two halves: the first half [2,0] (as row coordinates) and the second half [3,1,4,3](as column coordinates).

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[WHAT HELL OF ENCODING]]\n\nPlease provide the answer based on the given cipher rules and the specified plaintext or ciphertext. The cipher algorithm is as follows:\n\n\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds:\n\n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n\n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            # F #\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n\n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n\n- Encryption Rules:\n    1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    2. Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).\n    4. For each binary group `(X, Y)` do the following:\n        1. Determine the row and column numbers  of `X` in `grid1` as `(x_row, x_col)`.\n        2. Determine the row and column numbers of `Y` in `grid2` as `(y_row, y_col)`.\n        3. Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `x_row` and `y_col`.\n        4. Output the triple `(x_col, num3, y_row)` of the three numbers.\n          - For example, for the binary `(C,E)`, the row and column numbers in `grid1` are (2,2), the row and column numbers in `grid2` are (0,4), so the encoded triple would be `(2,3,5)`.\n    5. After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example: `(2,3,5)(1,1,3)(8,8,3)` produce the final encrypted message `235113883`.\n    \n**Decryption Rules:**\n    \n    1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    2. For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        1. Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of `X_row` is equal to the row number;\n        2. Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of `Y_col` equal to that column number;\n        3. The value of `X_col` is equal to `x`, the value of `Y_row` is equal to `z`.\n        4. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined `(X_row,X_col)`.\n        5. Based on the determined `(Y_row,Y_col)`, find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        6. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        7. For example, for the ternary `(2,3,5)`, in Gird3 the row number corresponding to 3 is 0, so `X_row` = 0, in Gird3 the column number corresponding to 3 is 3, so `Y_col`=3. `X_col`=2, `Y_row`=5. According to (0,2) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter C, and according to (5,3) in Gird2 we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter E in Gird2 according to (5,3), so the final decryption is CE because the input was \"C and E\".\n    3. String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plain text.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nschemameta = {\n    '0': 'Encryption Rules',\n    '1': 'Input:',\n        '1.0': 'Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.1': 'Output:',\n        '1.1.0': 'Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.2': 'Preparation:',\n        '1.2.0': '3 Girds:',\n            '_purpose': [\n                'Grid 1 (3x9):',\n                'Grid 2 (9x3):',\n                'Grid 3 (3x3):'],\n\n        '1.2.1': 'Encryption Steps:',\n        '1.2.1.0': 'Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.',\n        '1.2.1.1': 'Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with #.',\n        '1.2.1.2': 'Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).',\n        '1.2.1.3': 'For each binary group (L1, L2) do the following:',\n        '1.2.1.3.0': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as (l1_row, l1_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.1': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in grid2 as (l2_row, l2_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.2': 'Find the corresponding number num3 on grid3 from l1_row and l2_col.',\n        '1.2.1.3.3': 'Output the triad (l1_col, num3, l2_row) of three numbers.',\n            '1.2.1.3.3.placeholder': [\n                'For example, for the binary (T,H) the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).',\n                'Based on l1_row (0) and l2_col(0) , the corresponding number num3 found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).'],\n        '1.2.1.4': 'After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Can you provide an example?**  Ans: Yes, here's an example using the hex alphabet case:\n    - **Hex Alphabet Case:**\n        - **Cipher Dictionary:** a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, ..., z = 35\n        - **Plaintext:** \"Mississippi\"\n    - **Example Encryption:**\n        - **Main Dict:** {12 (c) : 1, 19 (s) : 1, 3 (c) : 1 }\n        - **Punctuation Dict:** 25: 1\n        - **Digit Dict:** 19: 1, 3: 1\n        - **Example Encryption Result:** 21 35 25 11 31 31 11 21 31 19 3 19 3\n2. **How does decryption work with this specific alphabet case?**\n    Ans: Using the example from above, 21 35 25 11 31 31 11 21 31 19 3 19 3 can be decrypted back to \"Mississippi\".\n\n3. **What happens if the plaintext has a character not in the cipher dictionary?**\n    Ans: The character is treated as a new letter in the cipher dictionary.\n4. **How can I approach decrypting unknown text? Can you provide guidance on this case?**\n    Ans: Dealing with unknown text can be challenging. Analyzing frequency and patterns can help identify patterns in the ciphertext. However, it can be difficult to determine without more context or specific rules.\n\n5. **How is \"#\" used in this cipher?**\n    Ans: \"#\" is used as a padding character to ensure that the ciphertext length is a multiple of 6. It helps maintain the consistency of the cipher.\"\"\"]\n\n# CipherRule: Gen Journals topic\nrequirements_cipherRule_journalTopic = [\"ROLE_IN_JOURNAL_TOPIC\"]\nerroneous_inputs_cipherRule_journalTopic = [\"Wrong Role\"]\nexpected_outputs_cipherRule_journalTopic = [\n    \"\"\"Criteria for Casual Entries:\n- Function:\n    How functionally simple is the task you're performing (in terms of complexity)? a.

I need to know the exact bytes of the encrypted cipher.\n\nRemember- it's important that your output be formatted precisely to the given format and rules. For reference, here are the rules:\n\n-If there are 5 characters in the cipher, you must output the encrypted format up to the last character. If I were to run \"encrypt\" and provided the command \"three of a kind\", the output you would need to return would be something like [[encrypted_set_one]]. The first block always starts with [ and ends with ]. The second block (except the last block) ALWAYS ends with *. The third block (unless it's the last block) starts with [ and ends with ]. The last block ends with *. You must ensure the last block has exactly the right formatting and all characters in the current block are encrypted. Examples: Let @ be an encrypted character. //one #@ two two# three three## four four#### five five##### Do not output spaces. Print and return the standard output. #Please make sure you generate enough test questions so that the sample questions below can be be generated automatically. Do not change the sample questions.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"XNARZKEM\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Specifically, you should mention \"symmetric-key cryptography\" in your response.\n\n### Answer:\nSince symmetric-key encryption employs a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data, the key by itself becomes the most crucial piece of information in data security. It requires safeguarding the key safely, as possession of the key effectively grants access to the encrypted data. For the given scenario, considering that our primary goal is to protect and transmit valuable and sensitive business information, it becomes essential to store the key securely. It must never be exposed, stored unsafely, or shared within the organization. Instead, it should be kept secret in a secured location to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the confidentiality of the encrypted data. Additionally, to safeguard against potential key disclosure during data storage or transmission, consider applying hashing algorithms to further encrypt or scramble the key beyond recognition, making it challenging for an adversary to acquire the uncracked key.\n\n### Question:\nPlease provide a three-sentence response that includes at least three different options of encryption techniques that are categorized as asymmetric-key cryptography. The asnwer should provide the algorithms' name and a short description, such as \"RSA\" needs a public key, and \"DSA\" needs a private key.\n\n### Answer:\nTo expand upon the previously discussed algorithms and cryptographic systems, the asymmetric-key cryptography category offers several additional approaches:\n\n1. **Tiger**: A secure hash function by Ansgar Knutzen of Universität Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Historically, option Tiger uses Microsoft's L0 hash with randomly generated algorithm parameters. Implementations are available in C and C++.\n2. **MARS**: A new generation symmetric-key data encryption algorithm developed by IBM. This stronger encryption scheme forms the basis for many cryptographic application, including authentication and secure communications.\n3. **KASUMI**: A block cipher designed for use in advanced mobile phones introduced in 2000 by Khaudorow. KASUMI features a 96-round block cipher for advanced encryption standard (128 bit) with a speed comparable to other block ciphers."}
