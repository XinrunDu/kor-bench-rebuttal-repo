Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A];[B]]"}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S**\u00a0is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C**\u00a0is what?\n4. **Q**\u00a0is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing.

Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

These trademarks are used to distinguish the production or service characteristics of the producer or administrator. You can also provide the Intensional Definition and the two principles of the registration principle for trademarks.\n\n### Answer:\nTrademark Intensional Definition:\n\nA trademark, distinct from a patent, is a sign used to distinguish a company's goods or services, or both, from other companies' goods or services. A trademark, often known as a brand mark, is a distinctive image, inscription, or design that distinguishes a company's items. Trademarks are distinct from protected intellectual property.\n\nPrinciples of existence:\n\n1. Distinguishability: A trademark should be distinctive to distinguish the goods or services of one entity from those of others.\n2. Ownership: A trademark should be owned or controlled by the entity that uses it.\n3. Legality: A trademark should not cause confusion, misleading, deception, or offense to consumers or other businesses.\n\nTrademark registration:\n\n1.

He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
