For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Live code explanation answer:\n\nThe explanation for the encryption and decryption process involves mapping characters using three alphabets (reserved, standard, and substitution) as well as shifting letters. The details are as follows:\n\n1. During encryption, \"C\" is moved four spaces in the standard alphabet to get \"G\". Then \"G\" is mapped to \"H\" in the reverse alphabet. Finally, \"H\" is mapped to \"F\" in the substitution alphabet. So after encryption, \"C\" becomes \"F\".\n\n2. During decryption, \"C\" is mapped to \"H\" in the substitution alphabet. Then \"H\" is shifted backward four spaces according to the standard alphabet to get \"D\". Finally, \"D\" is mapped to \"C\" in the reversed alphabet. So after decryption, \"C\" should be \"V\".\n\nWhen asked to decrypt again, the process explained above is applied once more.\n\n### Live code question answer:\n\n[[V]]\n\n### Live code question and answer:\n\nQuestion: Plaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Professional standards ensure puzzles and designs are clear, engaging, and visually appealing. They include using appropriate colors, fonts, and layouts, as well as following specific rules and guidelines for creating and solving puzzles.\n\n2. Why are professional standards important? Professional standards are important because puzzles are evaluated by professional puzzle designers and solvers. As a puzzle architect for players of all levels, from entry to world-class level, there is significant pressure to create exciting and visually stunning puzzles.\n\n3. What exactly makes professional standards in puzzles difficult? Applying professional standards to puzzles and graphic designs is difficult because it requires focus on details. I have to ensure the puzzles are attractive and well-balanced. At the same time, I have to maintain a higher standard in solving puzzles and generating answers.\n\n### Leaderboard:\n\n.ihere-player-leaderboard {\nmax-width: 175px;\nmargin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n-moz-user-select: none;\n-webkit-user-select: none;\n-ms-user-select: none;\nuser-select: none;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nflex-direction: column;\nmin-width: 0;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list {\nmax-width: 175px;\nfont-weight: 900;\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nborder-radius: 6px;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\nborder-radius: 6px;\npadding: 0.7rem 0.1rem;\nmargin-bottom: 0.2rem;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nmax-width: 150px;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-avatar {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-nick {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-score {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.leaderboard-box {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nopacity: 1;\npadding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;\nbackground-color: rgb(248, 254, 255);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nz-index: 2;\nposition: absolute;\nbottom: 7rem;\nleft: 1rem;\nright: 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nwidth: auto;\nanimation: pop 0.9s 1 forwards;\nbox-shadow: rgb(0 0 0 / 20%) 0px 1px 4px, rgb(0 0 0 / 14%) 0px 2px 3px, rgb(0 0 0 / 12%) 0px 1px 8px;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 500px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 300px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@keyframes pop {\n0% {\ntransform: scale(0.75);\nopacity: 0.25;\n}\n100% {\ntransform: scale(1);\nopacity: 1;\n}\n}\n.leaderboard-box-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nmargin: 1rem 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nopacity: 1;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 700;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n}\n.leaderboard-box-title {\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--"}

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

(Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,"}

In his 1904 speech, he stated \"those crafty people in Spain are opposed to us, not Germans.\" The speech was turned into an opera in 1909. In 1910 he made the first recorded journey to Antarctica, to see Antarctic glaciers. On 29 April 1912, during a month and a half war with Germany, he claimed to have been forced to fly under false colors, shortly after arriving back in the United States from his month and a half stay in Tangier, where he took its flags from a German submarine. After being taken to the fleet's headquarters in Italy, he then sailed to Tangier, another British-controlled naval base. The mission was initially successful, but the Germans soon took an active part in the attack, sending in airships to attack him, supposedly taking him and his ship back to Germany. Contrary to his orders, aviators began bombarding the Russian airfield in Seville (which was subsequently destroyed by the Allies) with a new experimental 75mm bomb called the \"Muniz bomb\". This bomb contained 400kg of a highly toxic poison, and had a 70% death rate among the entire population of the town. The bomb proved very effective in destroying the Russian airfields and was dropped over the capital buildings of Seville. Some of those attacked had already been killed or had gone underground; those who survived were killed, and as a psychological effect, the civilian population was devastated. In the Battle of Safra Mahmoud Hamoud, the commanding officer assigned Manning as his principal assistant. While commanding the air arm of the rebel army, Manning had a number of air strikes on Russian cities, as well as an Italian front. During the summer tour, he flew a Suchie artillery piece over the bridge at Anzio, using it as a self-propelled transport.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of seventeen, Manning joined the Massachusetts Military Academy, a private officer's club that was regarded as one of America's most prestigious military academies. It was run by George Washington, who later became the commander of the U.S. Army. He did not enjoy school, and spent many days and nights staying away from home, studying military books. In 1925, he decided to leave the school and join the U.S. Army Air Corps as a pilot. He later received the bulk of military training as a navigator, but rather than immediately board a ship he went into a small squadron at home. In time, he learned the intricacies of flight procedures, such as avoiding aircraft by being a one-year apprentice in a foreign military position.\n\nWhile serving in America too, he became a member of The American Legion, the first African American military group to hold formal training in the use of aircraft. In his first year of training he had been granted permission to use the Spitfire XK7567 as his personal fighter plane. While still in his first year, he took part in a fly-by-night mission in the Bermuda triangle. Manning was a Chief Wingman with the USS Spitfire, when his plane was shot down in the Bermuda Triangle. Another American had also been killed, and was reported to have sustained minor injuries and the cockpit had fallen into the water. He managed to swim to the beach but was unable to move due to his injuries and had to be lifted from the aircraft in a sling, which was attached to a rescue boat. His plane was also shot down, but he survived; he was rescued and assumed to be still alive.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Manning decided to stay on with the AAF as a pilot, and began working as a civilian flight instructor. He later applied to join the British Air Force as a pilot. He married Peggy Flaherty, the daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten (Mountbatten's private secretary). They had three children.\n\nIs this the start of what would become PTI's latest new company (after its first step to oblivion)? Not quite, but you want to know what it really means for you as an individual. The answer, Manning goes, is a lot. They no longer ask: If we keep up the same way we're doing now (or perhaps start new), will we be able to get our customers to use PTI?\n\nI'm not sure about \"too much water being kept up.\" As Dave discovered on a hot summer day, water makes you feel hot. So if your company is trying to start new, you're really overdoing it, and you may not have known.\n\nWe'd love to talk the topic of water with you. Perhaps we can get our customers not to store water; instead, make it available to their friends so they can use it in the real world too. This would be a better idea for the following reasons:\nGiven that, we've got two main goals.\nThe first one is quite simple. Let's say we give everyone a few minutes to drink or mix up their water, and ask them to fill in two containers"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship.

Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T"}

So, you decide to change the fixed key.\n\nMischievous asks you to perform these tasks:\n1. Find the number of fixed keys you changed, noting that you can repeat the same key multiple times.\n2. Provide the unique combinations among the 50 fixed keys (in the usual notation of combinations).\n\n### Answer:\n1. As each character is encrypted independently, it's easy to calculate for each character. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is 2^8, so for each character, the number of fixed keys is 2^8. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is 2^8 x 2^8 x ... x 2^8 = 2^(8\\*50).\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from 2^8, the number of combinations is: C(2^8, 2) + C(2^8, 3) + ... + C(2^8, 50), which is a combination.\n\n### Question:\nCan you provide the above answer in LaTeX notation?\n\n### Answer:\n1. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is $2^8$, so the number of all encrypted results for each character is also $2^8$. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is $(2^8)^{50} = 2^{8 \\times 50}$.\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from $2^8$, the number of combinations is: $\\sum_{k=2}^{50} C(2^8, k)$.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\nSince the new rule is unknown, it's impossible to provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nOkay, the new rule is as follows:\n\n- Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n- Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2 ,6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 5)\n\nAccording to this new rule, please provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
