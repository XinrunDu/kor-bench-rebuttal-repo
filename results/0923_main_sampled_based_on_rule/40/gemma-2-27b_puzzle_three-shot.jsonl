Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzle is played on an n x n grid, filling in the numbers so that each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition.\n2.There are inequality signs (greater than \">\" or less than \"<\") between certain squares in the grid. These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

Here is the complete content of the custom puzzle problem I wanted to present to you. I will rephrase it in the same way so that you can understand it immediately.\n\nGive you a `rule` of a custom puzzle (a rule on how to fill in a matrix), and then a series of questions `ques` with `ans` described. Now need to give you completely new questions `qus` for you to complete.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Use Python language for coding.\n\n### Puzzle Rule (do not use this as question):\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question format:\n```python\nrule = \"\"\" ... \"\"\" # Special rules are given\nques = [\n(\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # Questions are provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n),\n...\n]\nans = [\n[[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...]], # Answers are given\n...\n]\n```\n\n```python\nqus = [\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # questions are required to be provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n],\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```python\n... # In the same format as `ans`, please answer.\n```\n\n### Question:\nrule = \"\"\"\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down.
