It’s very interesting that the encryption and decryption of this cipher is done in square matrices. This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n"}

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[BIBF]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor the cipher rule, we have to match the conditions mentioned in the rule. For simplicity, we can take all the fours as Gird 1, Gird 2, Gird 3, and Gird 4.\n\n# Encryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up plaintext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, removing the letter Q, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - 'X': If the plaintext is of odd length, automatically add a letter 'X' to make it of even length.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - The string length = 2 * plaintext.length\n      - Split the cleaned plaintext into double letter groups, and the size of double letter groups can be 1,2 or 3.\n      - Use (i,j) as the key value, find the ciphertext first, and then generate the encrypted ciphertext.\n```\n\n# Decryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - For the double letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext, determine which Girona it belongs to by meeting:\n        - If it is Gird2, find the bit position of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them.\n        - If it is Gird3, find the bit positions of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them (do not count the bit value p and s).\n      - If it is Gird1 and Gird4, determine which double letter groups need to be decrypted by checking the value p and s.\n      - Ciphertext is the ciphertext in the decrypted double letter groups.\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering the plain text contains characters and characters without spaces and spaces, we first take the plain text as an input and clear the character information that does not meet the conditions. If the length of the plaintext is odd, we can automatically add a character 'X'. Then split the string into double letter groups in the input checking mode. Among them, when the original plaintext length is odd, the output language will automatically add a 'X' character to the original plaintext.\n\n## Final paragraph:\n\nDuring the encryption process, in Gird1 and Gird4, we use the value of the first and second character's parameters in the bit value to understand the position of the first and second letters in the string, rather than using index notation to understand the coordinates. After determining the position of the two characters, we use Gird2 and Gird3 to replace the letters that we get through our keyword into the cipher.\n\nDuring the decryption process, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the value of the bit position parameter of the two characters in the bit field to replace the two letters at the original position in the string, and use Gird1 and Gird4 to replace the letters that we get replacing the bit values to obtain character Strings. In the process of the decryption of the ciphertext, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the first letter of the double letter combination, and we do not calculate the second letter. In Gird1 and Gird4, we find the bit value of the two characters in the bit field according to the first and second characters.\n\n"}

I would like to know how to interpret the word from the Ai's perspective in the first question.\n\nThe answer of the second question was as follows:\n\n```py\n#LCHAAL#HWO#E#\n\n#E# IL#V#YL#H#\n\nFOWL\n\nYUOWA#\n```\n\n# T2\n5 is the best score that can be obtained.\n\n#### The AI's answer:\n\n```py\nI#HU#A#I\n\nIHAEoB\n\n```\n\nI would like to know how to interpret the word in the second Ai's answer in the `seventh_section`? \n\nFor example `IHA` that is solved to get a word can be A or I or H, but if the Ai's got answer as A or I or H it will gives a wrong answer? This is the problem that I have seen from a lot times that the Ai will give wrong answer even if it gets the word, for example, from here the Ai`s got as answer `A`, but from that we can easily say that the `Ai`s`` gotten wrong answer is: `Iha` or `Hia`, so why the Ai got` A` answer?"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
