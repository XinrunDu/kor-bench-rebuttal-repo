Care about the carnivores, but not too much\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Answer:\nIn the above story, the details about the environment, animal groups, facilities such as prisons and police stations were all carefully designed based on the habits, living habits and personalities of different animal groups. The principle of design is as follows; 1. The needs of small animals are given priority; 2. The safety of vulnerable groups is guaranteed; 3. Reasonable cost per unit area 4. The design life cycle should be long; 5. Environmentally friendly designed, not polluted As a result, this city with the principle of \"everyone can do what they want\" has become a comfortable place for animal migration. Facing the serious crisis of the epidemic, governments of countries around the world, including China, have also implemented a series of measures to \"divide red and control the epidemic\" through a series of measures such as targeted prevention and control, timing and control, and targeted control The \"Anyone can be anything\" principle, although it is a city of animals, has some reference significance for China's current pandemic response.\n\n#### First, \"anyone can be anyone\". For example, at the beginning of the film, the animal police officer Judy Rabbit mistakenly entered the police station of the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect, and was judged by the lion mayor and the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect through their own understanding of the police, and even the lion The deputy mayor wants to do something about Judy Rabbit by himself. In such a society, the lion mayor does not need to deal with the police unilaterally because most of the animals in Animal City never want to use the police. With the little people, because most of the animals in Animal City have their own sense of justice, and even with carnivores, they should have mutual understanding and cooperation. In fact, when the rabbit Judy and the bear Bernie were searching for McHorn's murderer, they faced the scene where the lion Mayos were in conflict with many people because they were arrested. Even, Bernard can deal with the situation very calmly in order to protect Judy. Another example is that the wolf mother Yun and the lion deputy mayor Zhuge can cooperate as a team in solving problems. When Yun mother solved the case of the lion mayor's carpal tunnel syndrome, the lion deputy mayor clearly expressed that she should not give all the credit to other animals. Both scenes can also highlight the social composition of Animal City where animals of all kinds coexist peacefully.\n\n#### \"Everyone can be anything\" but with the help of \"any small animal can learn\". While \"anyone can be anyone\" helps animals form a kind of mutual trust and recognition, they also depend on some \"special\" animals to help each other and the \"anything\" can be done by animal-specific skills. For example, Mr. Big may be more powerful because he is a shrew. The otter that moves slowly as a member of the Department of Motor Vehicles may be better at operating the DMV with his excellent sense of smell. If it were not for the assistance of the weasel Zoe, who was on duty that day, Nick could not have completed the suspects’ case effectively. In fact, Judy's own skill is also very much like the assistance of the animals. As shown Yun's investigation of cases often depends on computers to help search clues. Even cats, as \"pacifiers\" in the eyes of shrews, still have many advantages in social governance such as Judy and the lion mayor. Therefore, any animal in the \"any\" can help each other, help the society, help the country as needed when necessary.\n\n#### \"Anyone can do anything\", but carnivores also take into account the animal culture of animals, and understand them as human beings do. For example, when I was inquiring about the cases, Mr. Big who was holding hippo coins would be more interested when he saw the hippo coins. And Mr. Big was also clear about the hippopotamus' attitude towards coins and followed the rules of animals in Animal City to trade coins, instead of treating the hippo coin as dirty. The relationship between the rabbit Judy and the wolf mother Yun also shows how animals with different backgrounds, cultures, and backgrounds can coexist in a natural way through their understanding of how different animal species have their own ways of life and customs. , Has the ability to think like a human being under normal circumstances, such as Mr. Big. Because of their animals in the same Animal City, both carnivores and herbivores can accept each other's differences.\nBecause most carnivores in Animal City know each other, and there seems to be no lynching in the movie, animals of different species are able to trust each other and cooperate with each other for the common prosperity of Animal City, without having to live side by side. There is a sense of crisis, and even those who have carnivorous tendencies can take the initiative to choose tolerance."}

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda.

Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen.

The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin. Outside the city, with Jing Ke's assistance, they disregarded the ambush by the Qin army, playing \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters\" together. They fulfilled Kuang Xiu's last wish, leaving behind a timeless masterpiece.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the design and manufacturing of tools and equipment during the pre-Qin period, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078.

If someone just saw an image as a whole, it wouldn't have anything to do with light entering the eye and stimulating the retina. Many scientists believe that the human mind is the \"electron chain of thought\" within an information system.\nHowever, in terms of the processing of consciousness, it is still not completely understood by science; neuroscientists are still working on the process of the formation of ideas, rationalizations, and thoughts. The brain is essentially an extremely elaborate computing machine, responsible for all aspects of a person's life, from breathing to walking. The brain is like a combination of a computer and a human operating system, managing all other internal organs.\nA person's consciousness is an integrated digital state constructed out of a person's knowledge, emotions, and beliefs. People's conscious digital state is a mixture of acquired knowledge, past experiences, and deeply rooted thoughts and emotions. Once informed, the brain responds, interpreting real situations, discovering problems, completing its own memories and forming new memories through its own cognition and emotional reaction.\nA human's unconscious activities directly affect every action they take, even when they think they exercise rational thinking. Our brain forms a rational digital state based on experiences and knowledge, but the unconscious plays a decisive role in determining what we do.\nHumans may struggle to explain many of their unconscious actions, but if we ask them why they don't fear death, they can always do so with sufficient reasons. A person's unconscious includes their own fears and concerns, impulses and unconscious mechanisms, including fantasies.\nThe term \"dream\" refers to a subconscious activity that humans engage in every night. Dream brain activity is not affected by our need to sleep. All kinds of thinking are processed in the brain while a person is awake but unaware. Dreaming is not a memory, recollection, or recall, as we often perceive it, especially after waking up.\nA person's unconscious is like an iceberg, with over 90% below the surface, representing its mental state, which is different from conscious thinking. However, in any age group, adolescents and adults are generally more focused on cultivating their conscious thoughts, and only around 5% of adolescents and only 2% of adults will delve into their unconscious thoughts. The adult unconscious is an entirely different world.\nHumans can easily control what appears conscious. Our unconscious brain is like a virtual existence. In any situation, we usually don't understand why we do what we do, even if we repeat the same actions again and again.\nThe conscious and unconscious brain processes work together when it comes to fighting and defense.\nWhen the body is stimulated by external objects, the unconscious brain initiates neural activities to determine the intention and behavior by concentrating on the external objects. It is not as good as the conscious brain's judgment in terms of processing power and efficiency. The conscious system is also not superior to the unconscious in decision-making efficiency or strength. The purpose of the conscious system is primarily to select appropriate goals, formulate strategies, and then guide the work performed by the unconscious system.\nThe human brain has a powerful language processing system and can establish complex networks of information through language and sound."}

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

Investigating, he finds a money stack with a face, unaware it's a robot named Cashina controlled by Plankton. Krabs falls in love, proposes to Cashina, and she accepts.

One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist.

She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing.

The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous.

The story's protagonist, Sophie, is faced with a difficult choice between two kings as the prince of another country exhibits signs of being cursed. Faced with this dilemma, Sophie seeks guidance from three wise men---a witch, a heart, and a castle. As she weighs the pros and cons of each option, she must rely on her wits to make the right choice. Howl's Moving Castle is a story of courage, loyalty, and moral fortitude, carrying viewers through enchanted lands and casting them in the spell of adventure.\nDuring a night walk, Howl encounters a young woman named Sophie who later discovers a moving castle located deep at the edge of the country. After a short time together and growing companionship with Howl, Sophie becomes engaged to him. Meanwhile, Howl inadvertently makes Sophie lose her youth while at the same time transferring his skills to Calcifer, a demon. Feeling that he can't possibly take such a foolish step, Sophie later returns the castle to Howie. However, buried under the straw is a Witch's curse that can not only rewind time but also curse someone. After breaking the curse, Sophie and Howie return to the castle together and break the curse permanently. In the end, they embarked on a journey in a forest and lived happily ever after.\nCast by a flame demon masquerading as a fire monster, Howl promises Sophie that he will not return to the country that bears his name. Howl's Moving Castle is a three-horsecastle located in a mysterious world. The castle can move forward, and Sophie, Howl, and the fire demon were drawn to the source of the magic of this magic castle, Calcifer, a flame demon. The castle has a moving mechanism that uses a human figure, a furnace. A human face is drawn on the furnace's back, which Sophie uses to direct the castle with a crane. Sophie fell in love with the fire demon who was hiding in a robot, but the robot couldn't come to life, as the castle was filled with a curse. Calcifer used his own heart to heal Sophie as a human being, but his heart was destroyed and the curse was lifted. After the curse is lifted, the entire castle returns to dust. The three of them were able to hug each other.\n\nIn a kingdom far, far away lives a powerful magician, Howl the Witch. Howl often devours the hearts of young girls as payment for his magical abilities and is currently sleeping with his longtime love interest, Sophie the Mirror Witch. In his sleep, he dreams of a girl, but he saves her from a storm and takes her to the castle. Sophie, like a dog, has a scarecrow near her that she cherishes. The scarecrow is alive but the young prince in the nearby land has disappeared. Sophie runs out of magical energy after helping the prince and is turned into an old lady. She runs to the witch with her scarecrow. The Witch of the Wastes brings her to a new castle and explains that Howl will love her despite the fact that Howl has been staying with Sophie for years. When Howl hears about Sophie's curse, he feels regretful, but he does not want to lose Sophie and leaves the castle after setting it on fire. Despite Sophie's warnings, the castle, with Howl's permission, returns to England. When the curse lifts and the castle is empty, flames consume the castle, leaving Sophie in tears.\n\nThe story is about a charming young wizard, Howe, who falls in love with a girl named Sophie and accidentally causes her to develop into an old woman. To prevent Sophie from leaving, Howe turns her into an old woman and lives next to her. Howe's moving castles are an ancient castle surrounded by a field of wind power, and Sophie appears to have disappeared. Howe wants Sophie to accompany him, but Howe has become desperate, and Sophie travels to a country ruled by magic and turns the country into a chaotic battlefield. Howe decides to leave Sophie with someone, so Howle steals Calcifer, Howe, the king's Witch, and Sophie and moves to the castle of Howe's mother, the Witch of the Wastes. Calcifer is a kind person, but he is a flame demon. Calcifer's magic is so weak that he could have lived with Sophie if she loved Howe. Howe, at first, was a little confused about the appearance of the castle and had no idea that it had been inhabited by Calcifer. Before Howe can meet Howle, Sophie leaves on a journey. After a few months, Calcer is expelled from the prison that Howe installed on Howe, as his own heart is already broken and his body is melting. Sophie takes Calcifer back to her castle, but is interrupted by Calcifer in the middle of their escape, forcing the door to close. Sophie tries to hide the door behind a mountain, but loses consciousness and becomes a little old due to stress. Calcifer turns into a little old man and flies to Hoe, and Soe, despite being an old lady, becomes more feminine. After returning to his castle, Howe realizes he had been too selfish, and his mother, the Witch of the Wastes, realized she had forgotten about Howe when she was gone the first time. Howe returns the magic scepter to the king and leaves Howe forever. Calcifer and two other girls set a small fire in front of Howe's eyes without Howe knowing.
