It is a significant contribution that leads to a significant advancement or change in a field or topic. \n\nOne of the key aspects of a research paper is its citation format. This helps to establish credibility and to ensure that the literature that is cited is accurate and current. There are various citation formats, and among the most common and widely used is the Harvard Referencing format. This citation format gives credit to the author of the source and the year the material was published. \nIn this format, authors’ last names and publication dates are used, with the reference being listed at the end of the text. For example:\n\n(Wright, 2017) \n(Wright and Smith, 2012) \n(Wright, Smith and Johnson, 2010)\n\nThe Harvard Referencing format can be more complicated than the author-date format. It requires authors to submit their dissertations or research papers for independent expert review, similar to the Scholarly Open Access Journals peer-reviewed system. However, it can be a valuable tool for establishing credibility and for ensuring the integrity of the literature that is cited.\n\nReference\n\nWright A. (2017).

Therefore, we should consider if there is an answer that follows the rule and hides the root.\n\nWe can refer to known cases with roots:\n\na^b = \\sqrt[b]{a^b}\na^{b+\\c{n}} = \\sqrt[b]{a} * \\sqrt[b]{a^{b+\\c{n}-\\c{1}}}\na^{b+\\c{2}} = \\sqrt[b]{a}\\sqrt[b]{a^{b}}\n\nIn this case, if a=b, then we'd have 3^3=3 to prove:\n5=\\sqrt{3+3}\\\\\n5=\\sqrt{6\\\\\nTherefore, 5 is a 4%3.\n\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\frac{15+\\sqrt{75}}{2}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {5*4} = 25+\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{5+4}+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2} =\\sqrt {20+\\sqrt {20}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {4}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt {20-2\\sqrt {}}{20-2\\sqrt {5}}}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt { 45-14\\sqrt {5}}}\n\n25+\\sqrt {16} = 36\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{25+\\sqrt{20+\\sqrt{20}}}\\sqrt{\\sqrt { 5}+{\\sqrt {4}}}=\\sqrt{\\sqrt {25+5+2\\sqrt{5}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{\\sqrt{30+\\sqrt{60+20}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt {\\sqrt 60+4+2\\sqrt4 +2\\sqrt(5*\\sqrt2)}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt 6}=3\\sqrt{\\sqrt {15}+2\\sqrt3+{2\\sqrt2}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt 15\\\\\n36 = 6\\sqrt5\\text{ ans.}\\sqrt{30+6\\sqrt 5}\n\nNow, 16%8 should be 0 and 16%6 should be 3.\n\n- Therefore, the answer is 3+\\sqrt{15}.\n\n- 16%1 should be 4, 16%2 should be 64 and 16%1 should be 64.\n\n- 16%5+5 should be 25+\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt {5+4.} Multiplying the number on the top can produce `25+5`, which is indeed proven in the above work.\n\nThe best answer is `5-+-\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {\\sqrt {45-14\\sqrt {5}}}.\\text{With the first answer, take the value as 64, then multiply the two terms to get back to the original result.\n\n###### Solution 2:\n\nIn this question, the root of the answer is 2. Based on this result, the answer should look like:\n\n3+\\sqrt{2}\n\n3 is mulitplyied by the root 2, which also equals 2, ensuring that the given equation is valid.\n\nSince 16%4=0 and 16%6=3, the answer would be `[[2+\\sqrt{16-6}]]`.\n\nHowever, we should write it in the form `[[2+\\sqrt{x}]` `[[16-x]] The second problem:\n\n4%2 =  4 * 2 - 2^{4-1} = 8 - 16 / 3\n\n4%1 =  4 * 1 = 4\n"}
