I have provided a few examples.\n\n### More examples of additional rules:\n1.Must be a noun (not a verb or adjective).\n2.Must start with a two letter combination (e.g. ar, at, a-).\n3.Only five letters are used\n4.Only two letters are used (e.g. ll to make it or the other way around)\n5.Only two or four letters are used.\n6.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n7.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n8.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n9.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n10.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n11.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n12.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n13.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n14.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n15.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n16.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n17.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n18.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n19.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n20.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n21.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n22.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n\n## Bonus Challenge:\nYour Task: Think of an additional challenge. To make sure that you give something different and not the same (or at least similar). If the original challenge is not really complex or looks similar, you can add a couple more constraints or apply some more common sense to find the pattern.\n\n### Bonus examples of additional rules:\n1.For Rubik's cubes the color that is not changing but remains red, blue, green or yellow.\n2.For Rubik's cubes the hue of the final result when at least one part is changed.\n3.The 5 colors. The cube always will have blue, green and orange. It is not related to the rest. The second part needs to be either red or yellow (or both). The other part can be either red, green or yellow. It cannot be blue.\n\n## Hints:\nA hint goes to the rule that allows you to make at least one word out of it to make the question more specific. These hints are not to make easy the answer or to make you determine the rule just after doing the first one or two hints. Without these hints, you can figure out the rule as well (because the hints usually involve other examples other than this challenge).\n\n### Hints:\n1.You can change the color of six sides. You do not have to do it necessarily with all six sides. You also do not have to do it with a side.\n2.You can change the color of the 3s, 5s, 4s and the 2222.\n3.You can change the color of the 222 or 555 or 33 or 44.\n4.The colors can be added or removed (e.g. 1: blue, red. 2: red, blue). You can put another cube next to it.\n5.You have a sticker. For example while in combination with cube1 (422, 98, 4080), the sticker remains blue (you can also remove the sticker). You can do it either with side3 (option one), side5 (option two) or with side9 (option three).\n\n## How to deal with challenges without using Hint?\nYour job for the hour is to solve each problem in the challenge set without using the hint. It does not mean ignore each challenge but it means using the hint once (and only once). Keep in mind that sometimes the difference between challenging the rule and giving a correct answer (or even an approximate answer) may not be so big. In those cases and when you can really determine with extreme accuracy which way it is heading, you can confirm it by using a hint."}

Since the letters are separated by spaces, we can read the terms in a row. Firstly, let's cross out the letters: H A = 7, I H = 3, K G N = 9, and L G N = 9.\n\nNow, let's move on to the provided answers. Firstly, we have two rows, I V I Y = 9 and L A Y = 6. Because it doesn't make sense to assign 'I' to 'L', we exclude the first query.\nSecondly, we have three rows K G I P T = 9, C H C D E E = 7, and M A D C E M E = 8. Since the terms are separated by spaces, we can clearly see that C, H, and D are assigned correctly. As for G, we remove F F after applying the rule, the only remaining candidate is T, which equals 2.\n\nConfusingly, T equals 2 as the letter G was assigned by a letter that started with a capital letter.\nNext, we have two rows D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3.\nWe find two labels C and F, \nSince every label is different, we assign 'M' to 'F'.\nFinally, let's check out the remaining rows. Let F be 2, as there were already labels C and F.\nNow, when we label the remaining D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3 rows.\nWe can see that the first row has 7 entries P, H, C, M, and D, while the second row has 6 entries G, F, K, E, and M. Because the number of items in the first row is less than that in the second row, 7 < 6, we need to recalculate the assignment.\nIf we recalculate, the number of items K = 65, and the number of items C = 73. Since the number of G items in the first row is still the same as before, let's assign \"K\" to \"G.\"\nNow, we have the labels M G K E H, corresponding to the green lines on the left side and the green lines on the right side. After reconciling our labels, we arrive at the final answer H E K D C G M.\n\n### Question:\nA = 1 B = 2 C = 3 D = E = 5 F = 7 G = 9 H = 1 I = 5 J = 3 K = 4 L = 8\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nLet's assign 1 to each alphabet, starting with \"A\", followed by \"B\", and so on, through \"Z\" as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n### Question:\nB = C D = 6\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nA B E G U L O X = 6 A B F V = 7 A F I V = 8 A G I = 9 O L K K S = 6 A F G E R = 7 A O U U K A X = 6 A J W U D C X = 7"}

Once a consensus on its meaning has been reached, identify and document any unique properties or requirements of each rule portion.\n2. **Assign each rule portion a color**: To gain a deeper understanding, assign each portion of the rule (e.g., Empty, Mine, and 8 numbers) a distinct color. Repeat for a similar rule. The goal is to distinguish between each portion.\n3. **Identify the colors of an n×n grid**: The rule mentions filling empty spaces with A. Fill them with the assigned colors. Assign a distinct color to the negative space (between the received and sent grids). Another color will be assigned to the grid sections. Repeat this process until the entire grid is colored.\n4. **Examine the color requirement interpretations**: As the solution progresses, refer to the comments for color interpretation. If there is concern that a change might impact the answer, the instructor's guidance might be sought.\n\n## Implementing the Solution\n1. **Set up the input array and assign variables A and B**: To format the input array, declare an array and a variable for each row. Assign them X (empty) and A (mine).\n2. **Process rules one by one**: Apply each rule to each section of the input array, replacing X with A for mined areas and X with X for empty areas.\n3. **Check the rule's applicability**: For every added number, verify with a reference. If the number is within the given range (0-9), follow the rule. Otherwise, omit additional operations.\n4. **Check the rules for conflicts**: Fix any mistakes found by reprocessing with the previous number replaced X. Refer to the printed steps for assistance.\n5. **Print out the final answer in the same format** Read the rules and convert into the number and alphabet array format. Replace any A with 0 and X with A. Append into the full matrix, and put in double square brackets at the end.\n\n## Solving Sample Questions\nFor each question, follow the same process outlined above to solve it.\n\n## Acknowledging the Developer\nAs you begin by introducing the developer and yourself, establish the developer's privacy and confidentiality.\nTo demonstrate awareness of our responsibilities, review Privacy, Security and Affordability Code of Practice at the end of this guide.\nThe developer agrees to have his or her name and contact information deleted from the summary, student submissions and final report after the project has been finished.\n\n1.The developer and I wish we could have contributed to this wonderful tool. Thank you for letting us help!\n\n2.The developer and myself would like to thank you for allowing us to practice coding with you. Though, we can assure you that it was enjoyable and beneficial. It wasn't such a long one, as you must understand we didn't have that much time available.\n\n3.We'd likewise like to give a suggestion on another area wherein the idea would seem a troublesome technique to deal with riddles. We want to give an option that could be conceivable instead of the manual framework of filling the empty spots (referring to the first solution for question 1). The main idea is to encode the number in way that can be decoded to find the answers. The technique should have the following characteristics:\n\na.It would be in regards to one more number lattice (or matrix)\n\nb.The lattice contains some bit of numerical data (of its just first line), and the numbers must be set so they sum up to the number that pixels are marked on.\n\nc.The numbers should be arranged in a way that:\n\n--a number once found is used only for one step and not for several.\n\n--only one right-side value can be found as a by-product of moving forward.\n\n--each right right side value should be found after no less than the last marked pixel before that.\n\nd.Pixels are filled with the same character while it is correct\n\n### Notes\n*To help the program work properly, please ensure that there is at least one number per row, for example; 3, 4, 2, 3\n*The program will take an input, and display its answers at the bottom.\n*It is advised, that we provide multiple rows at a time, and the output should be one-to-one.\n*We suggest to make the input integer only, by converting the string to integer using eval() function\n\n\n### Credits\n-The script was created by Taran Ahmed and Hayder Ahmed for learning purposes.\n"}

Format the answer with a comma inside the N, and use the double brackets on the answer [[N], separated by commas, if decimals.\n\n### Example:\nThe matrix:\n\t25\t96\t22\t75\t86\t\n\t20\t65\t74\t43\t64\t8\n\t10\t3\t33\t70\t99\t2\n\t92\t86\t69\t56\t35\t4\n\t71\t42\t8\t51\t85\t\nAnd the change:\n\t3\t3\t3\t20\t6\t\n\nAnswer to this example:\n[[96,25,22,75,86,20,65,74,43,64,8,10,3,33,70,99,2,92,86,69,56,35,4,71,42,8,51,85,]]\n### Instruction:\nThere are valid puzzle rules scattered across the internet compatible with different types of engines. Be sure to check if the provided rule is valid. If you're having trouble, try to search for other rules that may be valid. You're not required to code from scratch if another's code is simpler, cleaner or even written better. It's a good idea to ask questions.\n\n### How to Try Your Puzzle:\n1. Prepare. Read the problem carefully.\n2. Answer the question. Understanding the puzzle is more important than the rules.\n3. Demonstrate your understanding by demonstrating the rule's execution on the solution.\n4. Use an appropriate Python 3 programming language (e.g. Python 3.7).\n5. Write code. Solve the problem.\n6. Try your solution out. Once implemented, use the test function to verify it.\n7. If you receive an error message, check your code against the example.\n8. For clarification on errors, clarify your doubts by asking your doubts clearly.\n\n### Classes and Functions:\nThe function has the following structure:\n```python\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    try:\n        # test your variables using built-in tools in this \"code.\n        if variable1 == 'boolean true value':\n            # set the value of an output variable to string format.\n            variable2 = 'Output'\n        else:\n            variable2 = 'Output'\n    finally:\n        # In order to ensure output in \"result\" containing the final output, you may ignore the code of this part.\n        result = 'result'\n\n    return result\n```\nIn this interface, function names can be addressed and called freely. You don't have to name them as \"f1\", \"f2\" or \"f3\". However, functions often get similar names with similar functions. This is necessary to identify which variables belong to which functions.\n\n# Define your functions here.\n### Defining Functions:\nFunctions must have an engine function interface. The function name specifies:\n```python\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    try:\n        # test your variables using built-in tools in this \"code.\n        if variable1 == 'boolean true value':\n            # set the value of an output variable to string format.\n            variable2 = 'Output'\n        else:\n            variable2 = 'Output'\n    finally:\n        # In order to ensure output in \"result\" containing the final output, you may ignore the code of this part.\n        result = 'result'\n```\n\n##### # Define your functions here.\n### Implementing Functions:\nFunctions should be implemented using a sequence of named instructions and variables. The \"try-execute-exception-return\" interface allows your variables to have meaning within your function and later for other functions to act dynamically according to the state of the variable. An \"if-else\" model can be used to control the flow of instructions more precisely. You can implement variables that are dynamically created and cleaned up later with appropriate commands.\n\nThe function is defined in the form:\n\n```python\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    try:\n        test your variables using built-in tools in this 'code.'\n        if variable1 == 'boolean true value':\n            # set the value of an output variable to string format.\n            variable2 = 'Output'\n        else:\n            variable2 = 'Output.'\n    finally:\n        # In order to ensure output in \"result\" containing the final output, you may ignore the code of this part.\n        result = 'result'\n```\nEach function is run within a new context. Use variables inside the function that are defined by yourself to capture the behavior of functions.\n\n### Variables with a Meaning:\nYou can define and use variables within functions. This allows you to pass variables and customize functions as needed.\n\n#### In Python's if-elif-else statements:\nYou can implement an \"if-else\" condition. If you \"choose\" the right \"if-else\", you need to define variables to allow variables to have meaning.\n```python\nif variable == 'variable value':\n    string = 'current_string'\nelif else 1==1:\n    string = 'this_is_else'\n```\nIf variable1==1 in all cases is conditional, then variable1 can be used as a variable (string), such as the if statement mentioned above, variable1 has no meaning.\n```python\nactual_variable1 = variable1\nif common_logic(actual_variable1, variable2) > 0:\n    # In some cases common_logic is used to control the flow of the function.\n    # You can choose to implement variable1 as a string, such as the if comparison of variable1 as a boolean value.\n    variable1 = 'this_is_variable1'\n    break\nelse:\n    variable2 = 'this_is_variable2'\n```\n#### Set a default value:\nIf all other variables fail to work, you can always choose the default value. Use the value to set the variable, such as:\n```python\nif all other variables are incorrect:\n    result = 'default_value'\n```\n"}
