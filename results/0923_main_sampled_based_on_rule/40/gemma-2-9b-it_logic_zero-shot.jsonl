There are truth assignments where this formula evaluates to True and others where it evaluates to False. For example:\n\n    *  If p1 is True and p2 is True, the formula evaluates to True.\n    * If p1 is True and p2 is False, the formula evaluates to False.\n\n* **(2) (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)**\n\nThis formula is also not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula. Its truth value depends on the specific truth assignments of p1, p2, and p3.  \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore specific truth assignments or further analyze these formulas!\n"}

This formula expresses a relationship where if point Gp is true, then point \u00acG\u00acp must also be true. \n\nLooking at the Time Proposition Relationships defined in the rule:\n\n* **\u2217 Relation:** Pairs exhibit a state of exclusivity. Either one is true, or the other is false \u2013 they cannot both be true or both false. Formula 17 does not demonstrate this type of exclusivity.\n\n* **\u21a6 Relation:** Pairs can be both false but not both true. Formula 17 implies a directional truth relationship where the truth of Gp guarantees the truth of \u00acG\u00acp.\n\n* **\u26ad Relation:** Pairs cannot be both false. However, they can both be true. Formula 17 doesn't express this type of restriction.\n\n* **\u2042 Relation:** Pairs can both be true or both be false. Formula 17 implies a stronger relationship, where the truth of one point necessitates the truth of the other. \n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Reasoning Formula 17 best aligns with the  **\u2217 relation**.\n"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]] \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe passage demonstrates Method \u2d63 (Changes corresponding changes):\n\n* **Observations:**\n    * Increased number of deep wells.\n    * Increased amount of underground water used.\n    * Increased rate of ground subsidence.\n* **Causation Implied:** The changes in the number of wells and water usage directly correspond to changes in the rate of subsidence.   \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other examples or have more questions!"}

Here's why:\n\n* **Universal Hypothesis:** The statement \"All swans are white\" (\u2200x(S(x)\u2192W(x))) is a universal hypothesis.\n* **Confirmation Standard:**  Observing a white swan (R(a)\u2227B(a)) seemingly confirms the universal hypothesis, aligning with the typical confirmation standard.\n* **Equivalence Condition:** The inverse proposition (\u2200x(\u00acW(x)\u2192\u00acS(x)))  is considered logically equivalent to the original hypothesis.\n* **Contradictory Confirmation:** Observing a white object that's not a swan (\u00acS(b)\u2227\u00acW(b)) also appears to confirm the original hypothesis through the inverse proposition. This creates a contradiction \u2013 two seemingly distinct observations both confirming the same hypothesis. \n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other logic puzzles!\n"}

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !

Indirect Argumentation Methods\n\n- Contra- Method: Indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one.

According to the definition of even numbers, n is divisible by 2.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\n\nIf n is odd, it can be expressed as n=2k+1, where k is an integer. According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]] \n\n\nThe provided reasoning uses the **Case+ Method**. \n\nIt analyzes the truth of the proposition \"any integer is one of the two: even or odd\" by examining two distinct cases: when n is even and when n is odd.

It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks.

Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx).
