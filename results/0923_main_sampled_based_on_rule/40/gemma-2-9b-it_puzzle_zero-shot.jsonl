This connects #134 to either Ozzy or the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 4:** The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch. This gives us another possibility for the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 5:** #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.  This tells us the order between #120 and Ozzy.\n\n\nBy combining these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n* **#118 finishes in fourth place.** \n* **Since #126 is one place ahead of Kermit, Kermit must be second.**\n\n* **The third place finisher could be #126 or Stretch.  However, we know #126 is one place behind Kermit, and Kermit is second. This eliminates #126 as a possibility for third place.** This means Stretch must be third.\n\n\n\n*  **The only remaining possibilities for Ozzy is to be either first or to finish before #120 based on clue 5.\n\n\nGiven the rules of the puzzle, we can't definitively determine the placing of  Ozzy,  but we can deduce the other placements. \n\nLet me know if you have any other puzzle rule sets you'd like me to try! \n"}

So, a cell in the first column has a weight of 1, a cell in the second column has a weight of 2, and so on.\n\n* **Finding the Solution:**  We need to strategically place '1's (representing filled black cells) in the grid to ensure that the sum of weights in each row and column matches the given constraint. \n\n* **The Process:**  Solving this puzzle requires a combination of deduction and trial-and-error.  There might be multiple possible solutions, but I provided one that satisfies the constraints.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other puzzle examples or have any further questions! \n"}

Unfortunately, I can't give you a definitive numerical solution without a way to make logical deductions and solve the system of equations created by the regions. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Interdependence:** The regions rely on each other.  The numbers in one region influence the possible numbers in others.\n* **Multiple Solutions:** There might be multiple valid solutions that satisfy all the given constraints.\n* **Computational Intensity:**  Finding a solution would involve a lot of trial and error or a sophisticated algorithm designed for constraint satisfaction problems.\n\n**How to Approach This Puzzle:**\n\n1. **Start with Easy Regions:** Look for regions with the simplest operations (like addition or a small number target). These can give you clues about possible values in intersecting cells.\n\n2. **Pencil Marks:**  Use a pencil to lightly write down possible candidates in each cell. As you solve regions, eliminate possibilities based on the numbers you've placed.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns:**  Search for patterns or relationships between regions.

Simply providing a list of numbers doesn't capture the spatial relationships needed to solve it.\n\n**How I'd approach solving this (and how you can too):**\n\n1. **Understand the Grid:**  The grid layout is a 6x6, meaning the skyscraper heights can be from 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Focus on the Clues:** Analyze the numbers on the sides. Each number tells you how many skyscrapers of a certain height you'd see in that direction.\n\n3. **Start Simple:** Look for cells with only one possible height based on the surrounding clues. For example, if a row has a '1' clue, and you can immediately see that only one cell can accommodate a height of 1, fill that in.\n\n4. **Elimination:**  Use the \"no repeats in rows/columns\" rule to eliminate possibilities. If you know a height '3' already exists in a column, you can eliminate  '3' as a possibility for other cells in that column.\n\n5. **Trial and Error (With Pencil):**  For harder puzzles, you might need to make tentative guesses and see if they lead to contradictions. Have a pencil handy to erase and try again.\n\n**Remember:** Skyscraper puzzles are logic-based.  There's a unique solution, but it takes careful deduction! \n\n\nLet me know if you want to work through a smaller example together.\n\n"}
