The algorithm requires iterating through each pair of entities, hence the complexity is proportional to the square of the number of iterations. This time complexity can be justified by analyzing the process of determining the implementation of formulas under J, which involves operations that grow quadratically with the size of the input. The Big-O notation concisely expresses the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm's running time, indicating the algorithm's complexity as O(n^2). In this case, the time complexity is mainly dominated by the number of iterations, which is proportional to the square of the size of the input. The algorithm's computational requirements increase as inputs grow larger, making it necessary to choose appropriate data structures and implementations to manage memory efficiently and mitigate the impact of high computational complexity on resource usage."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S**\u00a0is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C**\u00a0is what?\n4. **Q**\u00a0is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing.

Universal Affirmative Proposition (A): All S is P, can be converted to All S is not non-P.\n    2. Universal Negative Proposition (E): All S is not P, can be converted to All S is non-P.\n    3. Particular Affirmative Proposition (I): Some S is P, can be converted to Some S is not non-P.\n    4. Particular Negative Proposition (O): Some S is not P, can be converted to Some S is non-P.\n\nMethod B\n- Definition: Exchange the positions of the subject and predicate of the original proposition to form a new proposition.\n- Applicable Propositions:\n    1. Universal Negative Proposition (E): All S is not P, can be converted to All P is not S.\n    2. Particular Affirmative Proposition (I): Some S is P, can be converted to Some P is S.\n\nMethod C\n- Definition: First perform obversion, and then perform conversion to transform the proposition.\n- Applicable Propositions:\n    1.

Proposition P2 indicates that it is morally forbidden for individuals to harm others within social connections.\n\nApplying reasoning formula 7, which relates moral duties and permissions, we can infer the correct conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is that there is a moral obligation for individuals to strive to maintain social relationships.\n\nRationale: Reasoning formula 7 implies that if an action is prohibited, then its opposite\u2014the opposite action\u2014is allowed. Since Proposition P2 prohibits harm to others in social relations, the opposite action of maintaining social relationships is implicitly allowed. This reasoning formula suggests that if an action is prohibited, its corresponding opposite action is allowed."}

{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[E]]\n\n1) Method of casual derivation based on frequent concurrency of conditions and objects: (1) S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ so that (1) S A B     P\n(2) S C D     P\n(3) S E F     P and (2) Method of causal derivation based on simultaneous absence of object and condition-effect relationship: when S is present, P occurs at the same time while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc. exist: S A B     P\n\n2) If S is present, condition P occurs, whereas when S is absent, condition P does not occur.

However, another observation showed that some birds in a different part of the region were unable to fly, which according to equivalence conditions, should also confirm that all birds are capable of flight.\n\nWhich paradox does this scenario represent?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nA study was conducted on two different types of plants. The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

According to the convention, three-party events always use the form \"(A, B, C)\". If the middle subject is changed, the predicate can also change, which is the interpretation of the Convention Principle.\n3.

B provides a straightforward and clear response, indicating that they prefer walking. In contrast, C provides a lengthy and marked expression, offering multiple possibilities (bike, car, train).

It is likely that B does not actively write it as \"not a fact,\" but B is reluctant to make general counter judgments and instead makes a generalization: whether the inference is true is up to the listener to decide. \n\nWhich principle is B using to make the above statement?\n\nA.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
