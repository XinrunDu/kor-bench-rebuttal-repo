within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' (within 2 grids means it is in squares where 1 grid is the border of the 2 grids).\n2.For every '#' on a black point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' points (the same as 1).\n3.There is at least one '#' on each point.\n\nEvery input file is guaranteed to have an answer.\n\n### Format for input and output:\nThe format for input and output is as follows:\n[input]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n[output]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n\nOne line represents a picture, only alpha (alpha is used to represent a character in a String).\n\nOne line describes the output result.\n\n### Examples:\n```\nInput:[1][.......x][......xxx][..xx.xxxxx][xx.x.....][........x]\n\nOutput:\n[[1][x......][x......][x.....xx.]]\n```\n\n### Input:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx.x.x\n\n### Output:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx#x#x\n\n\n### Hint:\nConsider applying the rules one at a time to determine the number of empty spaces.\nFor example, you can start with rule 1 and determine which points require '#' under rule 1. Then, you can consider rule 2 to evaluate whether the points where all rules apply or if additional rules need to be considered.\n\n### Implementation of rule 1:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Implementation of rule 2:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n"}

The goal of this challenge is to develop a computer program that solves the Arrow-Blast Puzzle, an interesting arithmetic puzzle consisting of a collection of different sized blocks, all filled with a number. The player of the puzzle needs to add an arrow to each block so that all numbers on the blocks add up to the target value $\\tau$ and each arrow may touch no more than 3 other arrows. All arrows are drawn in simple blocks (black blocks) and no two arrows can point in the same direction in such a way that the arrow points at another arrow or at the empty space below it. The objective of the challenge is to help students develop their logical thinking, their coding skills and their understanding of computer programming.\n\n\n### Puzzle Instructions\n\n\n1. In the case of a `Single Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `3` if the value of digit 40` is even: `8432418`.\n2. In the case of a `Even Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `5` if the value of digit 40` is odd: `8432415`.\n3. In the case of a `Odd Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `10` if the value of digit 40` is even: `8432418`.\n4. In the case of a `Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `7`.\n\n### How to play\n\n\n1. **You are going to play an interactive game, where the rules of the game as changed by solving the arrow-blast puzzle. Therefore, the rules are not stated in this challenge.** \n2. <strong>The first thing that you need to learn is how to play the game</strong> for an **Arrow-Blast Puzzle** and how to do this you can watch the **video instruction** on YouTube for [the video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&t=0s) .\n3. In the video you will have the option to skip to a certain **solution** for the game based on the **goal** you're trying to reach.\n4. Once you’re done with the **puzzle** , you're going to see the **solution** by using the submit button.The **solution** will display in **markdown** .\n### Description\n\n\nThe program **reads** two integers separated by a space. The first number of **target value** $\\tau$, the second number of **current sum** $\\sigma$. The solution to the problem is to print the **final digit from target** to **current sum**.\n\n**Note:** The digits 0,1 and **7 are omitted** from the program since these are **the only numbers allowed to print**. \n\n### Solution\n\n\n1. We can solve this **puzzle** using **backtracking**. We will create a stack and push the numbers from ** 1** to ** 7** (we are not counting the 10) and **pop** the numbers at a time. If the value of the **current sum** exceeds the target value we should stop the program. \n2. We can use a **binary tree** to implement **backtracking**. We create a binary tree with the following **nodes** :**The root** node is with **value** $\\tau$ ,**the left child node** is with **value** $\\sigma$ .The **right child node** is with the **value** which is of the **current sum**. We continue to update the **value** of the **current sum** by adding **numbers from 1 to 7**. \n\n### Example\n\n\n```\nInput1: 8, 0\nOutput: \n8432418 -> \n9432418 -> \n9432417 ->\n9432416 ->\n9432415 ->\n9432414 ->\n43241 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n7432412 ->\n1432411 ->\n1432410 ->\n```\n\n### Solution\n\n``` python\nfrom __future__ import print_function \nmax_num = 1000 \ndef solve(num, curr_max):\n    if num = = 1 and curr_max == 1:\n        if num > 1000:\n            print(\"No Solution.\")\n        else:\n            print \"Solution:\" \n            print(max(num, curr_max))\n        elif num == 1:\n            print \"Solution:\" \n            print(max(num, curr_max))\n        elif curr_max<1000:\n            print(\"No Solution.\")\n            retur\n"}

By solving the traditional maze, most people start from the starting point and will of course use the traditional 'backtracking algorithm' to locate the goal, but what if we have a more intelligent method to solve the puzzle?\n\n*In fact, the use of intelligence and wisdom is equivalent to rewriting a rule similar to the rules of life. The key is to master the correct use of this wisdom or intelligence, that is, to rewrite the program.\n\n*While playing this game, what we can do is to give reasonable guidance and direction to the player at any time, so that once he encounters a situation, he will not be confused. These reasonable prompts are often called 'inflection points'. In essence, these inflection points are based on a powerful AI rule, and this shell-like calculation rule includes several principles:\n\n1. Every cell in a grid corresponds to an accurate arrow.\n2. There is no possibility for a circular reference. The grid is not in a cyclical arrangement.\n3. There is no possibility to choose a new path after moving to a certain grid, and can only follow the direction indicated by the arrow.\n4. The AI has absolute confidence that it is able to reach the goal smoothly.\n\n*Of course, this traditional maze only requires these four principles, and the corresponding game rules are not difficult. If you have ever heard of 'Life Rules', you may remember that the starting condition is an empty table with different points of life sprinkled on it. These points of life are simply arranged randomly according to AI's confidence in the future. The goal of 'Life Rules 2048' is to rule out these rules of life like a puzzle to maximize the use of intelligence or wisdom to create an intelligent assistant who can effectively solve the puzzle.*\n\n### Instructions:\n\n*In the program, you are required to design a program that can calculate the inflection point. The calculation process can use dynamic programming methods, and when there are errors, we will send a corresponding rule to guide you to solve the problem.*\n\n### Output Example:\n\nOutput in the form of a function, the function named ```solve```, input the shape of the maze ```board```, and output a list corresponding to the positions of the inflection points as well as the result of the inference."}
