This formula is a Truth Formula because it is always true regardless of the truth values assigned to p1, p2, and p3. If p1 is true, then the right side of the implication must also be true, which it is since p1 itself is one of the disjuncts.

However, the outer implication would then be of the form \"false implies [~p2]\", which is true regardless of the truth value of ~p2 (and thus p2), because an implication is true when its antecedent is false.\n- If p1 is false, then the inner implication (p1 =::> ~p1) is true (since anything implies a true statement when the antecedent is false), but this doesn't necessarily tell us about the truth of ~p2.\n\nThus, the truth of the entire formula depends on the truth value of p2, which means it is not a Truth Formula because it does not hold true under all possible assignments.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether each formula is a Truth Formula, a Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we need to analyze the structure of each formula and consider all possible truth assignments for the propositions involved.\n\n(1) ~(p1 =::> p2) & p2\n\nThis formula is the conjunction of the negation of an implication and p2. The implication p1 =::> p2 is false only when p1 is true and p2 is false. Thus, its negation is true in the opposite case, when p1 is false or p2 is true. The formula ~(p1 =::> p2) & p2, therefore, is true only when p2 is true and p1 is false, and false otherwise. This makes it neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula, as its truth value depends on the assignment of p1 and p2.\n\n(1) is C (Neither).\n\n(2) (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nThis formula asserts that two conjunctions are equivalent. The left side is true only when both p1 and p3 are true. The right side is true only when both ~p1 and ~p2 are true, which means p1 is false and p2 is false. For the entire formula to be true, we would need p1 to be both true (from the left side) and false (from the right side), which is a contradiction. Therefore, this formula is never true, regardless of the truth assignments of p1, p2, and p3. It is a Falsehood Formula.\n\n(2) is B (Falsehood Formula).\n\nThe final answer, following the specified format, is:\n\n[[C];[B]]"}

For the first equivalence `((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))`, let's apply the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Start with `(p>q)&(p>r)`:\n   - By (10 ) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`, we can rewrite both implications:\n     `(!p | q)&(!p | r)`\n   - Distribute `!p` over both sides (using the principle behind (5 ) but for `|`):\n     `(!p&!p) | (q&!p) | (!p&r) | (q&r)`\n   - Simplify by removing redundant conjunctions (using the idea from (2 )):\n     `!p | (q&!p) | (r&!p) | (q&r)`\n   - This doesn't directly simplify to `!p | (q|r)` (the right side of the original equivalence) without further assumptions, but let's check if they are equivalent under the rules:\n     - We can distribute `!p` over `(q|r)`:\n       `!p | (q&!p) | (r&!p) | (q&r)`\n     - This matches our previous expression, so we can say:\n       `(!p | (q|r))`\n     - Thus, the first equivalence is valid.\n\n2. For the second equivalence `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`, let's apply the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Start with `!(p=q)`:\n   - By (7 ) and (11 ), `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)` and `A > B ::=:: !A | B`, `p=q` can be written as `(!p | q)&(!q | p)`.\n   - Negate this using (6 ): `!((!p | q)&(!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p)`\n   - Applying (6 ) again, `!(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q`, and similarly `!(!q | p) ::=:: q & !p`:\n     `(p&!q) | (q&!p)`\n   - This is equivalent to `(p|q)&!(p&q)` as given by the distributive laws and the properties of negation, confirming that the second equivalence is also valid.\n\nGiven the analytical steps and the matching results, both equivalences are valid according to the 16 Basic Equivalences provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n`[[A];[A]]`"}

If `q` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Shanghai), then `r` and `p` must be false. This would make the first part of the expression `!p&q&!r` false, but since `p` is false, the second part `p&!q&r` is also false. This contradicts the fact that `E` must denote a situation where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect. Therefore, `q` cannot be true on its own.\n\n2. If `r` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Hangzhou), then `p` and `q` must be false. This would make both parts of `E` false, which is also a contradiction. Thus, `r` cannot be true on its own.\n\n3. If `p` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Suzhou), then `q` and `r` must be false. This makes the first part of `E` false (`!p&q&!r`), but the second part `p&!q&r` simplifies to `p&!q&!r` since `r` is false, which matches the requirement for one of the persons to be entirely correct (in this case, Person B with `p&!q`).

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nThe formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is in principal disjunctive normal form and can be denoted as what? This formula belongs to: (multiple choice)\nA. Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic Form D. All-Even Form E. All-Odd Form F. None of the Above\n\nAnswer format: [[denoted expression];[options]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given formula is already in disjunctive normal form, and it is a principal disjunctive normal form because it consists of paired disjunctive terms. The formula is:\n\n(\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nWe can convert these terms into the notation provided by the logic rule:\n\n- (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) corresponds to the binary number 001, which is 1 in decimal and 1 in hexadecimal, so it is denoted as m1.\n- (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) corresponds to the binary number 010, which is 2 in decimal and 2 in hexadecimal, so it is denoted as m2.\n- (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) corresponds to the binary number 101, which is 5 in decimal and 5 in hexadecimal, so it is denoted as m5.\n\nThus, the formula can be denoted as:\n\nm1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5\n\nSince the formula includes some but not all of the possible paired disjunctive terms (given there are 3 propositional variables, there could be 2^3 = 8 terms in total for a full disjunctive normal form), it is not a tautology or a contradiction. The formula includes m0 (which would correspond to \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr, but this term is not present in our formula), so it is not a basic formula. The indices of the included terms are 1, 2, and 5, which are not all even or all odd.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5]; F]\n\nCorresponding to:\n\n- A. Tautology: False\n- B. Contradiction: False\n- C. Basic Form: False\n- D. All-Even Form: False\n- E. All-Odd Form: False\n- F. None of the Above: True\n\nSo the formula belongs to \"None of the Above\" based on the provided categories."}

Combining these, we get:\n  - \"For all x, if x is a prime number, then x is 2\" symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 x = 2).\n  - \"4 is not a prime number\" symbolized as \u223cF(4).\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use 0-ary predicates for the symbolization, and 0-ary predicates by definition do not take any individual variables, we need to treat each statement as an atomic predicate that is either true or false without reference to variables. Thus, we can represent the statements directly as:\n  - P1: \"Only 2 is a prime number\" can be represented as a 0-ary predicate A, where A stands for the truth of this statement.\n  - P2: \"4 is a composite number\" (or equivalently, \"4 is not a prime number\") can be represented as \u223cB, where B stands for the statement \"4 is a prime number\" (which is false based on the given information).\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (1) using 0-ary predicates is [A; \u223cB].\n\n(2) If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\n- For this part, we define a binary predicate G(x, y): x > y.\n- The proposition is a conditional statement that can be symbolized directly as \"If G(5, 4) then G(4, 6)\" where G(5, 4) represents \"5 > 4\" and G(4, 6) represents \"4 > 6.\"\n\nTo fit this into 0-ary predicates, we treat the entire conditional statement as a single 0-ary predicate that is either true or false. Let C stand for the truth of the entire conditional statement \"If 5 > 4 then 4 > 6.\"\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (2) using 0-ary predicates is [C].\n\nCombining both parts into the requested format:\n\nThe answer is [[A; \u223cB]; [C]].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this interpretation stretches the concept of 0-ary predicates for the sake of adhering to the formatting requirements, as typically, 0-ary predicates would not be used to represent relationships between specific numbers but rather would represent fixed, atomic statements of truth or falsehood without reference to variables."}

Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38, which is already given as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. Replace entity constants with their assignments. In this case, 'a' is replaced with its assignment 'a\u2032 = 2'.\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols with their implementations. This means 'f' is replaced with 'fJ(x, y) = x + y' and 'g' is replaced with 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols with their implementations. Here, 'F' is replaced with 'FJ(x, y)', which denotes 'x = y'.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to each formula:\n\n(1) \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'g' with its implementation, 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is: \u2200xFJ(gJ(x, 2), x), which simplifies to \u2200xFJ(x * 2, x). Implementing the predicate FJ(x, y) as 'x = y', we get:\n\n\u2200x(x * 2 = x)\n\nHowever, since we are working with natural numbers and the predicate FJ(x, y) is 'x = y', we need to express the formula in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) \u2203xF(f(x,a),y)\u2192\u2203yF(f(y,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'f' with its implementation, 'fJ(x, y) = x + y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is:\n\n\u2203x FJ(fJ(x, 2), y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(fJ(y, 2), x)\n\nSubstituting the implementations of 'fJ' and 'FJ':\n\n\u2203x (x + 2 = y) \u2192 \u2203y (y + 2 = x)\n\nExpressing this in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nTherefore, the answers in the requested format are:\n\n(1) [[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) [[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nNote: The double square brackets notation seems to be an unusual format for expressing logical formulas.

Given that \"p\" is used to denote \"there is life on Mars,\" the statement is transforming this to a context of life in a fire, which doesn't change the essence of the proposition about life existing or not existing. Therefore, the proposition can be symbolized as (#p - # there is life) or (#\u00acp - # there is not life), connected by the inclusive disjunction symbol (-).\n\n(2) \"If Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship.\" This statement involves a conditional relationship where if one condition (p: Li Ming plays well) is true, then the possibility of another condition (q: he wins the championship) opens up. This can be symbolized using the implication symbol (>) between the two propositions, with the second being a possibility ($q).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the symbolized propositions enclosed in parentheses and modal symbols for each statement are:\n\n(1) The necessity of either life or no life in a fire can be represented as #(p - \u00acp), where the - symbol represents the inclusive disjunction as per the logic rule notation guide.\n\n(2) The conditional relationship of if Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship can be represented as (p > $q), where p implies the possibility of q.\n\nPutting these into the requested [[];[]] format:\n\n[[#(p - \u00acp)];[(p > $q)]]\n\nThis format captures the initial symbolizations, which are then enclosed in square brackets to meet the output format requirements."}

This formula indeed captures the essence of the inference from a negated past period of time to a negated past point in time.\n\nConversely, the inference from \"Old Zhao did not work in Ningbo at some point in the past\" (\\( \\neg Hp \\)) to \"It is not the case that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past\" (\\( \\neg Ap \\)) can be made using formula 4, \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\), in conjunction with formula 7, \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\). This is because \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) leads to \\( H\u00acp \\), and then \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\) leads to \\( \\neg Ap \\).\n\nTherefore, there are two reasoning formulas directly involved in this inference process: formula 4 and formula 11.\n\nThe answer, in the requested format, is:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nHowever, if we count the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) (formula 7) as necessary for the second inference, then we would have three formulas involved:\n```\n[[3]]\n```\n\nGiven the specific phrasing of the question and the directness of the inference paths, the most appropriate answer, considering the direct formulas for the given question's phrasing, would be:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nThis interpretation emphasizes the direct inference between negated propositions without relying on the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) as an additional formula for the count, since formula 4 directly implies the inference of negated continuous action from a negated point in time, and formula 11 directly implies the reverse."}

This does not directly apply to Formula 17, as it deals with the relationship between a future period and its complement in the future, rather than two distinct points or periods.\n\n- **\u21a6 Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be true, but can both be false. Formula 17 fits this description. It says that `Gp` and `G\u00acp` cannot both be true (i.e., a proposition and its negation cannot both be true in the future period), which aligns with the \u21a6 relationship's property.\n\n- **\u26ad Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be false, but can both be true. This does not match Formula 17, as it explicitly states that if `Gp` is true, then `G\u00acp` must be false.\n\n- **\u2042 Relationship**: Pairs can both be true, or both be false. This does not align with Formula 17, as it precludes the case where both `Gp` and `G\u00acp` are true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Reasoning Formula 17 (`Gp \u2192 \u00acG\u00acp`) is consistent with the **\u21a6 relationship**.

Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\nB. Only Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\nC. Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the scenario where both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, we can analyze this situation according to the provided logical framework.\n\nAccording to the definition of common belief and the provided cognitive logic model:\n\n1. If a proposition `p` is a common belief within a group `G`, then every member of the group `G` collectively believes `p`.\n\n2. The scenario explicitly states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that the proposition \"2 plus 2 equals 4\" is a common belief among the group containing Alice and Bob. This means that each of them not only believes the proposition themselves but also recognizes (through the accessibility relation `R`) that the other believes it as well.\n\nApplying the given logic to the provided statements:\n\nA. Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement is consistent with the definition of common belief, as it implies that both Alice and Bob hold the belief and are aware of this belief in the other. Therefore, this statement is correct under the given context, assuming \"know\" is synonymous with \"firmly believe.\"\n\nB. Only Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement contradicts the initial conditions, which explicitly state that both Alice and Bob firmly believe the proposition. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement contradicts the initial conditions, which state that Bob firmly believes the proposition. According to the Axiom of Consistent Belief, Bob cannot simultaneously believe and doubt the same proposition. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answers are:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThus, the correct interpretation, given the logical framework and the initial conditions, is that Alice and Bob both know (or firmly believe) that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and this belief is a common one between them."}

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Question:\nIn 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The causal derivation of the passage is consistent with the **D. \u2d63 method**. \n\nThis is because the method involves observing changes in S (the presence or absence of uranium) corresponding to changes in P (the level of radioactivity) under the same conditions (A, B, C - referring to the constant conditions of the experiment, such as the type of mineral, experimental setup, and measurement techniques). The Curie experiment showed that varying amounts or states of uranium (S1, S2, S3) resulted in different levels of radioactivity (P1, P2, P3), eventually leading to the discovery of new radioactive elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[D]]"}

However, it's important to note that the proportions of 0.9 and 0.7 are not exactly the same but can be considered relatively similar in the context of statistical inference, depending on the threshold set for similarity. Assuming these proportions are sufficiently similar for the purpose of C-Reasoning (which is a qualitative judgment that might vary by context), we can proceed.\n\nGiven these assumptions, we use the C-Reasoning Rule to symbolize the inference:\n\n- If `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`, then `Pr(F, P_X) \u2248 Pr(F, P_Y)`.\n\nThus, the symbolization that denotes why the proportions of student satisfaction in the two schools can be considered similar, according to C-Reasoning, is:\n\n`[C(F, 0.9, 0.7)]`\n\nThis indicates that there is a similarity in the proportions of students satisfied with the school's facilities in School X and School Y, suggesting that the populations from which these samples were drawn (School X and School Y students) have similar proportions of student satisfaction regarding the facilities."}

The paradox arises because the confirmation of the universal hypothesis, \"All swans are white\" (\u2200x(S(x) \u2192 W(x))), through observing a white swan (S(a)\u2227W(a)) is intuitive. However, according to the equivalence condition, the universal hypothesis is equivalent to its contrapositive, \"All non-white things are not swans\" (\u2200x(\u00acW(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x))), which means observing a non-swan that is non-white (\u00acS(b)\u2227\u00acW(b)) also confirms the original hypothesis. This leads to a paradox regarding the confirmation standards and equivalence conditions, as the BC Paradox highlights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]\n\nThis choice aligns with the BC Paradox due to the structure of confirmation and the equivalence condition leading to a counterintuitive conclusion about evidence supporting the universal hypothesis."}

According to the Hearer's Inference CQ1, from the pair <love, like>, where \"love\" is the stronger term and \"like\" is the weaker, the statement \"I like her\" entails that B knows \"I love her\" cannot be established, thus implying B does not love Xiao Hong.

Specifically, the Hearer's Inference (CQ1) applies here. The statement \"Some soccer players are on the field\" (B) is weaker than \"All soccer players are on the field\" (A), and A entails B (since if all players are on the field, it is necessarily true that some players are on the field). By choosing to use the weaker statement without asserting the stronger one, the speaker signals to the hearer that they do not have enough information to assert the stronger statement, or that the stronger statement is not true (K~(A(s)) in the rule's notation).\n\nThe C% Principle's Speaker's Criterion states that one should speak as little as possible, but the context here involves choosing between statements of different strengths to convey the level of certainty or knowledge about the situation, which is more aligned with the C* Principle.\n\nThe C!

However, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" is straightforward and informative. The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is a direct, uncontroversial deduction from the statement rather than a result of the speaker being less informative than they could be.\n\n- **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalism in speech, and the inference is supposed to be based on expanding the minimal information provided by the speaker. The statement about the car door not closing implicitly assumes the car has doors (as per the convention or common knowledge), and the inference directly links to this assumption without requiring additional information.\n\n- **C! Principle**: This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions unless they serve a specific purpose. The given statement is straightforward and does not invoke any unnecessary complexity or marked expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" conforms most closely to the C% Principle, as it involves interpreting the minimal information provided in a straightforward manner, expanding on the given information in a way that aligns with common sense or conventions about cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```"}

This misapplication of knowledge can be seen as a substitution error, where attributes or knowledge about one object are incorrectly applied to another, leading to an erroneous conclusion. This fits the definition of InvSubError Method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[I]]\n\nExplanation: The fallacy arises from the incorrect substitution of facts known in the real world into the scope of Xiao Qiang's knowledge without ensuring that this knowledge is actually possessed by Xiao Qiang.

Xiao Qiang knows the first part (Lu Xun is Lu Xun), but the reasoning incorrectly assumes that this knowledge extends to the second part (Lu Xun's relationship with Zhou Jianren) without proper justification."}
