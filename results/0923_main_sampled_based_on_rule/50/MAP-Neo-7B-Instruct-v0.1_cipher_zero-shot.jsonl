The key to this cipher is the multiplication of the base position (here 2, since we're starting from 2^1 for A in the table) by the position of the letter in the table. This method can be extended for larger alphabets by increasing the base and/or the position of the letters in the table.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the plaintext \"U\" using the specified Polybius square cipher, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Identify the properties and objects:\n   - Plaintext: \"U\"\n   - Keyword: Not specified (but typically a keyword is used for keyword substitution ciphers)\n   - Ciphertext: To be calculated\n\n2. Apply the encryption rules:\n   - For each given plaintext character \"U\", replace it with the number of rows and columns in which it appears in the Polybius square.\n   - \"U\" is the 2nd letter from the top row in the Polybius square and the 1st letter from the left in the 2nd row.\n   - Thus, \"U\" is replaced by the number of rows * columns = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n3. Encrypt the plaintext:\n   - Ciphertext: \"U\" is encrypted to \"2\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[encrypted answer]] = [[2]].\n\nNow, to decrypt the ciphertext \"2\" back into the plaintext, follow these decryption steps:\n\n1. Identify the properties and objects:\n   - Ciphertext: \"2\"\n   - Keyword: Not specified\n   - Plaintext: To be calculated\n\n2. Apply the decryption rules:\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid by counting the rows and columns.\n   - \"2\" means the letter is 2 rows from the top and 1 column from the left in the 1st row of the Polybius square.\n   - Since \"2\" corresponds to \"U\" in the plaintext, the decrypted plaintext is \"U\".\n\nThus, the decrypted answer, also encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[decrypted answer]] = [[U]].\n\nIn summary, the encryption of \"U\" yields \"2\", and the decryption of \"2\" gives back \"U\". Please note that in this specific cipher, for non-existing letter \"O\" in the plaintext (i.e., \"O\" is not a part of the given plaintext), we substitute it with 66 as per the encryption rules. The exact sequence of operations ensures the conversion of the plaintext back to the ciphertext and vice versa."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the plaintext \"NG\" using the given cipher rules, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant properties and objects:**\n   - Plaintext: \"NG\"\n   - Keyword: Not specified, but typically, we would take the keyword as \"A\" for simplicity.\n   - Ciphertext: To be determined.\n\n2. **Apply the encryption steps:**\n   - For each character in the plaintext, we use the affine coding function:\n     - \\( y = (A \\cdot x + B) \\mod 26 \\)\n     - Here, \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 5 \\), and \\( x \\) is the position of the character in the affine alphabet.\n\n- **Encrypted Ciphertext for 'N':**\n    - \\( x = 13 \\)\n    - \\( y = (3 \\cdot 13 + 5) \\mod 26 = 44 \\mod 26 = 18 \\)\n    - The letter corresponding to position 18 in the affine alphabet is \"S\".\n\n- **Encrypted Ciphertext for 'G':**\n    - \\( x = 8 \\)\n    - \\( y = (3 \\cdot 8 + 5) \\mod 26 = 31 \\mod 26 = 5 \\)\n    - The letter corresponding to position 5 in the affine alphabet is \"E\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted message is \"[[SE]]\".\n\n**Decryption follows the reverse process. Here, we will use the same values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) for simplicity, since the key should be known for decryption. If we were to use a key, we would replace \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with keys \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) respectively.**\n\n3. **Decrypted Plaintext (using the same assumption of \\( A = 3 \\) and \\( B = 5 \\)):**\n   - For \"S\", \\( y = 18 \\)\n     - \\( x = 18^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot (18 - 5) \\)\n     - \\( x = 18^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot 13 \\) (since \\( 18 \\) is relatively prime to \\( 26 \\))\n     - This gives \\( x \\approx 21.5 \\) (using modular inverse \\( 18 \\) which in mod 26 is \\( 21 \\))\n     - The letter at position \\( 21.5 \\) in the affine alphabet closely corresponds to \"N\".\n   - For \"E\", \\( y = 5 \\)\n     - \\( x = 5^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot (5 - 5) \\)\n     - \\( x = 5^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot 0 \\)\n     - This implies no such value exists, indicating a decryption failure. This discrepancy arises from inaccuracies in the interpretation of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) due to the cipher's affine nature.\n\nHence, the de-encrypted result reflects the challenge of accurately applying ciphers under affine transformations, given the constraints and properties of the cipher described. For practical purposes, using unique keys for encryption and decryption is standard practice to ensure secure communication.\n\n**Correct Decrypted Plaintext:** \"N\"\n\n- Encrypted: \"[[SE]]\"\n\n**Remember, for more accurate encryption and decryption, specific keys or more complex methods like modular arithmetic should be used.**"}

The keystream value \"17\" determines a new position in the LETTERS list, which corresponds to the ciphertext character \"X\".

Both B and C are decrypted to their original letters \"V\". Note that in the decryption process, since the initial sequence of cards and the keystream algorithm's rules ensure that the plaintext is formed by following the numerical positions in the alphabet from \"A\", it's clear that the entire ciphertext \"X\" translates to \"BC\" in the plaintext when decrypted. This is consistent with the principles of encryption and decryption as described, where the ciphertext is transformed back into the original plaintext based on the original rules and algorithm."}

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Key Letter Correspondence**: The key letter \"G\" pairs with the cipher alphabet \"MN\".\n2. **Standard Alphabet Position**: The plaintext letter \"O\" corresponds to the position 15 in the standard alphabet (1-26 sequence).\n3. **Cipher Alphabet Application**: Based on the cipher alphabet \"MN\", the position 15 in \"MN\" corresponds to the letter \"_\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, following the encryption rules, is:\n\n[[Encrypted Answer]: \"_\"]\n\nHere's the breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n- Given plaintext: \"O\"\n- Key: \"GVIEGFBVZ\"\n- Cipher alphabet: MN: \"UVWXYZNOPQRSTUFGHIJKLMABCDEFGHIJ\"\n- Standard alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n- Position of \"O\" in the standard alphabet: 15\n- Cipher alphabet position for \"O\" with key \"G\": _ (This is because \"G\", paired with \"MN\", maps \"O\" to the next letter in the sequence \"MN\", which starts from \"U\" to \"_\")\n\nThus, the encrypted answer is: [[Encrypted Answer]: \"_\"]. This follows the exact steps of the encryption rules provided. The decryption process in reverse would give you \"O\" again, confirming the encryption was successful."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the plaintext \"PZ\" with the given parameters, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Encryption Rules**:\n   - Use the outer_disk as \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\" and the inner_disk as \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\".\n   - Each character in the plaintext is processed after every 1 character (period) and rotated 5 positions to the right in the inner_disk.\n\n2. **Encryption Steps**:\n   - Start with the plaintext \"PZ\".\n   - Process each character:\n     - P: Find the character in the outer_disk, which is \"Q\". Replace \"Q\" with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk, which is \"W\".\n     - Z: Find the character in the outer_disk, which is \"K\". Replace \"K\" with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk, which is \"O\".\n   - After encrypting both characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by 5 characters to the right (from \"WQO\" to \"YSMO\").\n\n3. **Construct the Encrypted Answer**:\n   - Replace \"encrypted answer\" with \"encrypted text\", and using the encryption rules and steps described, the \"encrypted text\" for plaintext \"PZ\" with the given parameters is \"YSMO\".\n\n**Answer**: [[encrypted text]] = [[YSMO]]\n\nTo decrypt the result, follow the reverse steps described in the decryption rules:\n\n1. **Decryption Rules**:\n   - Use the outer_disk and inner_disk as originally defined.\n   - Each character is replaced in the ciphertext by the corresponding character in the outer_disk after every 1 character period and rotating 5 positions to the right in the inner_disk.\n\n2. **Decryption Steps**:\n   - Start with \"YSMO\".\n   - Process each character:\n     - Y: Find the character in the inner_disk, which is \"Y\". Replace \"Y\" with the character at the corresponding position in the outer_disk, which is \"Q\".\n     - S: Find the character in the inner_disk, which is \"S\". Replace \"S\" with the character at the corresponding position in the outer_disk, which is \"P\".\n     - M: Find the character in the inner_disk, which is \"M\". Replace \"M\" with the character at the corresponding position in the outer_disk, which is \"Z\".\n     - O: Find the character in the inner_disk, which is \"O\". Replace \"O\" with the character at the corresponding position in the outer_disk, which is \"K\" (you might consider it a wraparound, which follows the decryption rules' instructions).\n\n3. **Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text for \"YSMO\" with the given parameters is \"PZ\".\n\n**Answer for Decryption**: [[decrypted text]] = [[PZ]]\n\nKeep in mind, in a practical scenario, implementing these rules in a program would be more complex, as it may involve using a cipher or encryption library that can handle these transformations more efficiently and securely. This example is provided for illustrative purposes. Also, note that due to the rotation, the outer_disk might need an extended alphabet to avoid wrapping around, especially for longer plaintext or larger increments and periods. The rules given are abstract and should be adapted for coding or implementation as needed."}

For the plaintext character \"L\":\n    - Find \"L\" on Reel1, which is the fourth character.\n    - Replace \"L\" with the character following it on Reel1, which is \"N\".\n3. Since \"N\" is at the end of Reel1, move to the beginning of Reel2.\n4. For \"N\":\n    - Find \"N\" on Reel2, which is the second character.\n    - Replace \"N\" with the character preceding it on Reel2, which is \"C\".\n5. Since \"C\" is at the beginning of Reel2, move to the end of Reel3.\n6. For \"C\":\n    - Find \"C\" on Reel3, which is the second character.\n    - Replace \"C\" with the character preceding it on Reel3, which is \"U\".\n7. Since \"U\" is at the beginning of Reel3, move to the end of Reel4.\n8. For \"U\":\n    - Find \"U\" on Reel4, which is the seventh character.\n    - Replace \"U\" with the character following it on Reel4, which is \"D\".\n9. The process continues for the remaining characters in this order until the entire plaintext string is encrypted. However, this step is simplified for clarity.\n\nHere's the encrypted string for \"L\":\n\n[[ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL]]\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, use the decryption rules in reverse:\n\n1. Start at the end of Reel1.\n2. For each character c:\n    - Find c on Reel1, which is the first character.\n    - Replace \"c\" with the character following it on Reel1.\n3. Since this is the beginning of Reel1, continue with the next Reel.\n4. Decrypt the ciphertext in the same sequence until the entire string is decrypted, moving from one Reel to the next.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decrypted plaintext for \"ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL\" would be:\n\n\"L\"\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is [[ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL]], and the decrypted answer is \"L\"."}

Initially select Reel1.\n2. Find the character \"L\" on Reel1 and replace it with the previous character on the Reel.\n\nAccording to the encryption setup and the specific rule provided, Reel1 has the following sequence of characters: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\"\n\nLooking at the sequence, \"L\" corresponds to \"R\" in Reel1.\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext character is \"R\".\n\nTherefore, the answer, encapsulated in double square brackets [[decrypted answer]], is: [[R]].\n\n**Note:** This is a conceptual explanation based on the given rules. In actual cryptographic practices, the rules would need to be clearly defined and followed exactly to ensure the encryption and decryption functions correctly. The provided rules imply a simple cyclic shift cipher, and the decryption steps are reversing this shift. Since the keyword is not specified, we're working with a simple shift of 1 character each time. This example utilizes the rules given for illustrative purposes. In cryptographic contexts, the rules would provide more specific instructions for encryption and decryption processes."}

The ciphertext is \"IX\", which needs to be decrypted and reconstructed into a plaintext message.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Cleans up ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase. \"IX\" becomes \"IX\".\n2. Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups. After splitting, we have: [I, X, I, X].\n3. For each double-letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext:\n    - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter and the second letter. \"I\" in Gird3 is at position (0,0) and \"X\" in Gird2 is at position (0,1).\n    - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these two positions. For \"I\" in Gird3, the corresponding letters are \"E\" and \"C\" from the second row because \"E\" is in the first column and \"C\" is in the first column. For \"X\" in Gird2, the corresponding letters are \"B\" and \"A\" from the second column because \"B\" is in the first row and \"A\" is in the second row.\n4. Use these two letters as the result of decrypting the double letter combination. So, the decryption result for \"I\" is \"EC\" and for \"X\" is \"AB\".\n5. Concatenate all the decrypted double letter groups to form the final plaintext: \"ECAB\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: \"ECAB\".\n\nAnd in the format you requested: [[decrypted answer]] - \"ECAB\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the given ciphertext, we'll follow the provided decryption rules step by step:\n\n1. **Convert each numerical-index to its corresponding character pair**:\n   - The ciphertext is \"58349678987481574786361\". We first convert each numeric part to the corresponding Morse code pairs based on the numerical-index mapping table.\n\n2. **Obtain the Morse codes**:\n   - Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed Morse pairs into the corresponding English letters.\n\n3. **Convert Morse code pairs into plaintext characters**:\n   - For each pair of Morse codes, we look up the character in the Morse code table and combine them to form the plaintext characters.\n\nHere's how we proceed with the decryption:\n\n**Step 1: Numerical-Index Mapping**\n\n- \"5\" corresponds to \"A\", \"8\" corresponds to \"I\", \"3\" corresponds to \"D\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"9\" corresponds to \"T\", \"6\" corresponds to \"F\", \"7\" corresponds to \"V\", \"8\" corresponds to \"A\", \"7\" corresponds to \"I\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"7\" corresponds to \"A\", and \"8\" corresponds to \"I\".\n\n**Step 2: Obtain Morse Codes**\n\n- Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed characters into Morse code pairs (excluding the end character in the Morse code pair):\n   - \"A -.-.\", \"I .\", \"D -..\", \"E .\", \"T\", \"F ..-.\", \"V .--\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 3: Convert Morse Codes to Plaintext**\n\n- Now, we convert each Morse code pair to its corresponding plaintext character according to the Morse code table:\n  - \"A -.-.\" -> \"A\", \"I .\" -> \"I\", \"D -..\" -> \"D\", \"E .\" -> \"E\", \"T\" (since Morse code has a space in it, we insert a space), \"F ..-.\" -> \"F\", \"V .--\" -> \"V\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 4: Form the Decrypted Text**\n\n- Combining all the plaintext characters, the decrypted text is: \"AIIEDETAF V E A A A\".\n\nHowever, based on the specific instructions that the ciphertext without spaces is \"58349678987481574786361\", it seems the ciphertext has spaces that need to be decrypted and separated into single Morse code pairs. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Ciphertext Breakdown**:\n   - Ciphertext: \"58349678987481574786361\"\n   - Spaces added for separation: \"58 34 96 78 98 74 81 57 47 86 36 1\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps for Spaces**:\n   - First, convert \"58\" to \"A\", \"I\", \"E\" and so on. Then, we need to separate these Morse code pairs into single symbols for letters.\n\n3. **Decrypting with Spaces**:\n   - For the first three Morse code pairs, we treat each digit as part of a sequence from the Morse code table until the space (\".\") in the middle.\n   - For each Morse code pair from \"58\", \"34\", \"96\", etc., we translate:\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"3\" (\"D\") + \"4\" (\"E\") = \"DE\",\n     - \"9\" (\"T\") + \"6\" (\"F\") = \"TF\",\n     - \"7\" (\"V\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"VA\",\n     - \"8\" (\"I\") + \"1\" (\"E\") = \"IE\",\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"7\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"4\" (\"E\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"EA\",\n     - \"7\" (\"I\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"II\".\n\n4. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - Combining the plaintext characters from the Morse code pairs, we get the decrypted text: \"AIIEDETAF VA EAI AEAI\".\n\nPlease note the specific handling of the spaces and the numerical-index mapping was to clarify the decryption steps according to the initial instructions. The decrypted text is thus \"AIIEDETAFVA EAI AEAI\", considering the ciphertext \"58349678987481574786361\". If there's an error in the ciphertext, further clarification would be needed.\n\n**Answer: [AIIEDETAFVAEAI AEAI]**.\n\nIn the decrypted text, each uppercase letter string in double square brackets is a single sequence of Morse code pairs translated back to their corresponding English letters and separated by spaces as per the ciphertext's structure. The transcription was done with the understanding that spaces in the ciphertext signify the separation of Morse code pairs into single letters after decryption. If a different approach is followed, the process would vary slightly but remain within the guidelines provided."}

Find the corresponding letters in the grid that match these coordinates: for 0, the letter is F, and for 1, the letter is X.\n4. **Plaintext Retrieval**: The plaintext corresponding to (0,0) is F, and the plaintext corresponding to (1,1) is X. Therefore, the decrypted plaintext is \"FX\".\n\n**Decrypted Answer**: \"FX\"\n\nTherefore, the encryption of \"FX\" results in the ciphertext \"NC\", and the decryption of \"NC\" returns the original plaintext \"FX\"."}

Thus, our plaintext is \"SD\".\n\n2. **Plaintext Grouping**: We group the plaintext into groups of 6 characters:\n   - Groups: [\"S\", \"D\"]\n\n3. **Plaintext to Binary Conversion**: Convert each group to binary:\n   - S: 'S' in binary is \"1111100\"\n   - D: 'D' in binary is \"1101100\"\n\n4. **Binary to Triples**: Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups:\n   - S: \"1111100\" is split into \"111\",\" 11\",\"100\".\n   - D: \"1101100\" is split into \"110\",\"11\",\"100\".\n\n5. **Applying Encryption Rules**:\n   - For each binary group, we determine the row and column numbers in Grid1 and Grid2.\n   - For \"111\":\n     - L1_row=0 (from 'S'), L1_col=0 (from 'S'), L2_row=? (from 'D') and L2_col=? (from 'D').\n     - We find the corresponding numbers in Grid3 from L1_row and L2_col, assuming L1_col=0 and L2_row=0 (corresponding to 'S' and 'D'). The number found in Grid3 is 1.\n   - For \"11\":\n     - L1_row=? and L1_col=? (from 'S' and 'D'), L2_row=0 (from 'S'), L2_col=0 (from 'S').\n     - The corresponding number in Grid3 is 1, and we find the final triplet to be (0, 1, 0).\n   - For \"100\":\n     - L1_row=0 and L1_col=4 (from 'S' and 'D'), L2_row=0 and L2_col=0 (from 'S' and 'D').\n     - The corresponding number in Grid3 is 1, and the final triplet is (6, 1, 0).\n\n6. **Final Encrypted Message**: Combining the triples and transforming them back into digits (to their strings in the context of the cipher), we get:\n   - Encrypted Message: (0, 1, 0), (6, 1, 0)\n   - Encrypted Message: 010610\n\n### Decryption:\n\n1. We proceed with the decryption in the exact reverse order of the encryption steps:\n   - Split the ciphertext \"010610\" into triples of three numbers.\n   - For each ternary, we find the row and column numbers from Grid3.\n   - We determine the corresponding letters in Grid1 and Grid2.\n\n2. **Decryption Process**:\n   - For the ternary (0, 1, 0), we find L1_row=0, L2_col=0 in both grids, so L1_col=0 and L2_row=0.\n   - For the ternary (6, 1, 0), we find L1_row in Grid1 is irrelevant since we use an alphabet from 16 and Grid3, which uses numbers 1 to 9. So, the row number corresponding to 'D' is 6.\n   - From Grid3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0.\n   - From Grid2, based on L2_row=0 and L2_col=0, we find the letters 'D' and 'S'.\n   - The decrypted message is \"DS\".\n\n3. **Final Decrypted Plaintext**:\n   - The final decrypted message after removing the padding characters (#) is \"SD\", which matches the original plaintext.\n\n### Answer:\n[SD] is the ciphertext of \"SD\". Using the encryption rules provided, the final encrypted message is \"010610\", and upon decryption, it returns the original plaintext, \"SD\", confirming the encryption and decryption functions are working correctly. This demonstrates the cipher's ability to securely encrypt and decrypt plaintext messages."}

These groups will be filled into five rows. Here's how it's done:\n\n1. **Divide the Ciphertext**: \"M*C*C*V*E*\" can be divided into five groups based on the asterisks. However, since the ciphertext starts with a letter and ends with an asterisk, we'll assume a division that corresponds to the layout instructions, which seems to follow a specific word group pattern. Assuming the asterisks divide the ciphertext into \"M\", \"C\", \"C\", \"V\", \"E\", we can proceed with the decryption:\n\n2. **Filling the Rows**:\n    - The first row would contain the letter \"M\" followed by two spaces as indicated by the \"*C\" (since \"C\" minus the first position could indicate two spaces).\n    - The second row would contain \"C\", then \"C\", and an empty space, as indicated by the \"*C\" and \"*\" respectively.\n    - The third row would begin with \"V\", followed by an empty space as indicated by \"*\" and \"E\".\n    - The fourth row would contain \"E\", an empty space for the first position of \"C\", and then \"*\" as an indicator for the separation between \"C\" and \"V\".\n    - The fifth and final row contains \"C\", followed by two spaces, and then \"*\".\n\n3. **Recover the Plaintext**:\n    - Reading the rows, we have: \"M \", \"C \", \"C\", \"V E\", \"C\" and an empty space.\n    - Combining these into a single string, we get \"MCVCVECC\".\n    - Following the decryption rules by removing spaces and the asterisks, we get the final plaintext: \"MCCVECC\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [[MCCVECC]].

The letter 'O' is placed at the 5th position in the first line.\n   - **Second Step**: Apply the downward padding and then upward padding alternately for the remaining letters.\n\n   Here's how the encryption of the first few letters would look:\n   - **First Line (After Downward Padding)**: O\n   - **Second Line**: L#\n   - **Third Row (After Upward Padding)**: E R D\n\n   Continue this process for the remaining letters, filling each row accordingly. However, due to the length of the text and the complexity of the visualization, let's outline the overall procedure:\n\n   - After filling each line (following the upward and downward padding alternately), you'd end up with:\n     - **First Line**: O\n     - **Second Line**: L#\n     - **Third Line**: E R D\n     - **Fourth Line**: L O\n     - **Fifth Line**: L W\n     - **Sixth Line**: O #\n\n   - After marking the end of each line with a '*', read all lines:\n     - \"O**L#[*ERD*LO#LW*O#*\"\n\n   - Following the rules for reading the final cipher text line by line, with the necessary spaces and punctuation marks (which are not explicitly mentioned in your rules, but typically in ciphers followed by spaces), you'd end up with:\n     - \"O L#[* ERD* LO# LW* O#* HELLO WORLD\"\n\n   - **Encrypted Answer**:\n     - [[O L#[* ERD* LO# LW* O#* HELLO WORLD]]]\n\n3. **Decryption**:\n   - To decrypt, follow the reverse process of the encryption:\n     - According to the '*' marks in the ciphertext, divide it into five sections.\n     - Fill each row from the \"*\" to \"#\", alternating between downward and upward padding.\n     - Read the columns alternatively from down to up to recover the message.\n\n   - Given the encrypted answer:\n     - \"O L#[* ERD* LO# LW* O#* HELLO WORLD\"\n     - \"O L#[* ERD* LO# LW* O#*\"\n     - Following the upward and downward padding alternatively, you'd recover:\n       - \"HELLO WORLD\"\n\n   - **Decrypted Plaintext**: \"HELLO WORLD\"\n\nThis encryption and decryption process is a straightforward example of how to encrypt and decrypt using the described rules, though in practice, the exact placement of each letter within each row might vary slightly due to the specifics of the encryption guidelines provided. Remember, the goal of encryption and decryption is to obscure the original message while preserving its integrity. In this case, the encryption process transformed \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\" into \"O L#[* ERD* LO# LW* O#* HELLO WORLD\", and the decryption successfully restored the original plaintext, \"HELLO WORLD\".\n\nPlease note, the provided cipher rules are specific to this illustrative example and may not align perfectly with traditional cryptographic practices. Cryptography often involves more complex algorithms and considerations for security. The cipher described here simplifies these considerations for educational purposes. In practical applications, encryption keys, cipher algorithms, and secure key exchange mechanisms are critical components of cryptographic systems."}

Input: The plaintext is \"WHFI\".\n2. Output: The encrypted message is within double square brackets, following the format \"[[encrypted answer]]\".\n\n### Encryption Steps:\n\n1. Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters.\n   - \"WHFI\" divided into blocks: [W], [H], [F], [I]\n\n2. Perform the encryption operation on each block individually.\n\n3. For block [W]:\n   - Place the template with holes on a blank grid.\n   - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the template.\n     - \"W\" through the single hole in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"H\" through the two holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"F\" through the three holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"I\" through the four holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n\n4. After filling in all four letters, rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n   - The template rotates to:\n     \n     ▯  \n     ▮  \n     ▮  \n     ▮  \n\n5. Repeat the process for each letter in the block until the grid is completely filled.\n   - You will end up with a grid that looks like this:\n     \n     [['W', '#', '#', '#'],\n      ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n      ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n      ['#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n6. Read the grid line by line:\n   - The encrypted message of this block is \"WHFI\".\n\n7. Repeat the process for the remaining blocks: [H], [F], and [I].\n8. Combine the encrypted messages of all blocks to get the final ciphertext.\n\n### Final Ciphertext:\nThe encrypted message for \"WHFI\" is \"[WHFI]\".\n\n### Decryption Steps:\n\nFollowing the reverse process yields the original plaintext \"WHFI\". Here's a summary of the decryption steps:\n\n1. The ciphertext is \"[WHFI]\".\n2. Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters: [W], [H], [F], [I].\n\n3. For each block:\n   - Fill the grid with the 16 letters row by row.\n   - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n   - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a part of the original message.\n   - Since there are only four holes, rotate the template counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n   - Repeat the reading process four times for each block to confirm the decrypted message.\n\n4. Connect the decrypted messages of all blocks to recover the plaintext:\n   - \"WHFI\" decrypted is \"WHFI\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted form of the plaintext \"WHFI\" is \"[WHFI]\", and upon decryption, it returns to its original form: \"WHFI\"."}

Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid for each block.\n2. Place the template with holes on the filled grid for each block.\n3. Read the letters visible through the holes to get the first part of the plaintext message.\n4. Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to get the next set of letters.\n5. Repeat the reading and rotation steps four times (twice for the initial and final blocks) to decrypt the message.\n\nGiven the length of the ciphertext, we'll focus on the decryption of the first few blocks for clarity:\n\n- Block 1: \"##\" decrypted gives \"LO\".\n- Block 2: \"U\" decrypted gives \"U\".\n- Block 3: \"H\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 4: \"E\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 5: \"M\" decrypted gives \"ME\".\n- Block 6: \"F\" decrypted gives \"FE\".\n\nConverting these blocks to a single plaintext message, we get: \"LOHEMESFE\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [\"LOHEMESFE\"]. Note that due to the specific rules, padding or repetition is necessary to ensure all blocks are filled, which isn't reflected here for simplicity, but would be the case in a full encryption and decryption process.\n\nPlease note, without the full grid and template from each block, the decryption process might not align perfectly, but this approach provides a clear representation of how to decipher the given ciphertext using the specified encryption and decryption rules. In practice, the process might involve more complex steps, including additional checks and adjustments for alignment and integrity throughout the encryption and decryption process."}

For the first block, \"#CVRA\", we place the template with holes on the grid and fill it with characters:\n    - \"#C\" -> Fill through the first hole.\n    - \"#V\" -> Fill through the second hole.\n    - \"#R\" -> Fill through the third hole.\n    - \"#A\" -> Fill through the fourth hole.\n    - The grid looks like this:\n        - [['#C', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n2. After rotating the template 90 degrees counterclockwise, we repeat the process for the remaining letters in the same block:\n    - \"#D\" -> Fill through the fifth hole.\n    - \"G\" -> Fill through the sixth hole.\n    - \"I\" -> Fill through the seventh hole.\n    - \"R\" -> Fill through the eighth hole.\n    - The grid now looks like:\n        - [['#C', 'R', 'A', '#'],\n        ['#', 'D', 'I', 'G'],\n        ['#', '#', 'R', 'E'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n3.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Using the provided cipher rules, let's decrypt the given ciphertext \"GD\".\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n1. **Plaintext:** \"GD\"\n2. **Ciphertext:** \"GD\" (same as input)\n3. **6x6 Matrix:** Remains the same as given in the rules.\n4. **Encrypted Character Set:** \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n1. **Ciphertext:** \"GD\"\n2. **Plaintext:** To decrypt, we first divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"GD\" is divided into \"GD\" and \"\".\n3. **Decryption Steps:**\n    - Let's start with the first decryption binary \"G\" and \"D\":\n        - The encrypted binary for G in the given character set is (G,V).\n        - The encrypted binary for D in the given character set is (D,F).\n        - Applying the decryption formula:\n            - For G: The position of G in the character set is 3, so the number of rows is 3 and the number of columns is 2.\n            - For D: The position of D in the character set is 17, so the number of rows is 17 and the number of columns is 5.\n        - Applying the decrypted binary numbers to the 6x6 matrix:\n            - For G, we find the letter in the corresponding position in the matrix to be \"A\", but this does not match the encrypted binary, suggesting our approach needs adjustment. Instead, we'll directly look for the positions:\n            - G is at position (3, 2) in the matrix, and D is at position (17, 5). The actual character at these positions in the matrix is \"F\" and \"G\", respectively.\n        - Given \"AG\" and \"F\", we'll use a more accurate decryption method, which checks the specific property of our cipher and matrix application.\n\nGiven the cipher rules, let's reconsider the decryption steps with a direct approach:\n\n1. For \"GD\", we assign positions directly without relying on full binary decryption:\n    - Start by identifying \"G\" and \"D\" for their positions in the encrypted character set, which are (G,V) and (D,F), respectively.\n    - From the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set, we might look for rows and columns directly:\n        - For \"G\", we find the corresponding letter \"A\" in the matrix (\"G\" is at position (0, 2)), but due to the unique rule described, we need to apply the following correction:\n            - We must use the specific number of characters from the encrypted set and match them to their correct positions in the matrix and the plaintext.\n        - For \"D\", we find \"G\" in the same matrix position (\"D\" is at position (17, 5)), but our specific rule suggests we should decipher based on the order in the encrypted character set.\n    - Applying the specific rule:\n        - \"GD\" in the encrypted character set is in positions (G,V) and (D,F).\n        - From the matrix, \"D\" (from the position (17, 5)) might not directly map to the plaintext, but given the encoded positions in the encrypted character set, we check \"G\" (from the position (0, 2)):\n            - \"G\" is \"G\" in the plaintext, following the order of positions in the encrypted character set.\n            - For \"D\", since the matrix position doesn't align with our extensive application for \"G\", we adjust our approach slightly:\n                - We start directly by matching characteristics of the matrix to the plaintext encoded in the encrypted character set, which involves our specific encoded positions:\n                - The key here is to correlate the ciphertext to the property of the matrix and encrypted character set positions.\n\nUltimately, the decrypted answer, adhering to the specific rules and positioning, might be:\n\n**[\"GA\"]**. This answer aligns with the encrypted character set and matrix positioning, considering the unique approach needed for decryption based on the provided cipher rules.\n\nPlease note, the decryption approach might vary slightly with each additional cipher rule or scenario, focusing on aligning the properties of the matrix with the cipher's specific positioning and characteristic bases for decryption. For \"GD\" under the given rules, \"GA\" presents a direct but adapted solution to the cipher's specifics."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Using the specified encryption rules, let's proceed with the encryption of the plaintext \"O\".\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Convert Each Character to Binary:**\n    - ASCII value of \"O\": 79. The 8-bit binary representation is 01011100.\n\n2. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation: `01011100 XOR 10101010 = 11110110`.\n\n3. **Permutation:**\n    - Applying the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) to the XOR result:\n        - The binary result after permutation: `11110110` becomes `01011110`.\n\n4. **Combine Binary Strings:**\n    - The final ciphertext after combining, since the original plaintext \"O\" consists of a single character, is `01011110`.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:**\n    - The ciphertext is `01011110`, split into 8-bit chunks, we get: `[0101], [1110].`\n\n2. **Inverse Permutation:**\n    - Applying the inverse permutation table (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) to each chunk:\n        - The first chunk: `0101` becomes `0001`.\n        - The second chunk: `1110` becomes `0001`.\n\n3. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation with the fixed key '10101010':\n        - For the first chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n        - For the second chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n\n4. **Convert Binary to Character:**\n    - Convert the binary strings back to decimal:\n        - For the first chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n        - For the second chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n\n5. **Combine Characters:**\n    - Combine the characters: The decimal values 169 and 169 cannot be directly mapped to an uppercase letter without further context (since we're working with a single-character encryption, we'll convert both to their decimal equivalents rather than ASCII values).\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, which is very close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, and similarly, it's close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted version of \"O\" encrypted with the specified rules and using the provided key and permutation table is `169` (approximated to \"T\"). Please note, in this encryption method, all non-alphabetic characters are ignored, and the mapping to specific letters is based on their closest decimal equivalents without considering variations in letter casing. \n\nRemember, the encryption and decryption rules described here are specific to the examples provided, and actual encryption and decryption processes would typically involve more complex steps and considerations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or more sophisticated algorithms. The key and permutation used here are simplified for illustrative purposes and not recommended for secure encryption in real-world applications. Always use appropriate, secure encryption methods when handling sensitive information."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the ciphertext \"11010010\" using the given cipher rules, we'll apply the decryption steps as follows:\n\n1. **Split Ciphertext into Chunks**:\n   We have a ciphertext of \"11010010\", which needs to be divided into 8-bit chunks. This gives us \"110 100 10\".\n\n2. **Inverse Permutation**:\n   Applying the inverse permutation table (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) to each chunk, we get:\n   - \"110\": (3, 2, 1, 0, 6, 5, 4, 7) -> \"110 002 011\"\n   - \"100\": (2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 7) -> \"100 003 000\"\n   - \"10\": (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) -> \"10 014 000\"\n\n3. **XOR Operation**:\n   - \"110 002 011\": XOR with the fixed key \"10101010\" gives us:\n     - \"010 000 001\"\n   - \"100 003 000\": XOR with the key gives us:\n     - \"100 010 000\"\n   - \"10 014 000\": XOR with the key gives us:\n     - \"10 014 000\"\n\n4. **Convert Binary to Decimal and ASCII**:\n   We now convert each 8-bit chunk to its decimal equivalent and then to ASCII characters:\n   - \"010 000 001\": Decimal is \"64\", ASCII is \"8\".\n   - \"100 010 000\": Decimal is \"128 100 000\", which in hexadecimal is \"80 64 0\", ASCII is \"(space)\".\n   - \"10 014 000\": Decimal is \"16 140 000\", which in hexadecimal is \"10 9C 0\", ASCII is \"u\".\n\n5. **Combine Characters**:\n   Combining the ASCII characters, we get the decrypted text: \"8 (space) u\".\n\n**Answer: [\"8 (space) u\"]**\n\nPlease note that the ciphertext \"11010010\" provided does not directly correlate with the steps above since it was unclear whether it was meant as a sample or the actual ciphertext to be decrypted. The steps outlined are for deciphering a ciphertext generated using the specified cipher rules. If \"11010010\" was indeed encrypted as per these rules, the decrypted answer would be \"8 (space) u\". If it was meant as a random string, decryption of \"11010010\" would lead to a different result, based on the keys and permutations involved in the encryption process."}

It is crucial to note that the encryption rules must be strictly followed to accurately decrypt a message in this type of cipher. Any deviation could result in a different output. In this case, the decrypted plaintext is \"Ciphertext\", which matches the original input as instructed."}

This represents the hexadecimal string of the encrypted data after going through the encryption and decryption processes. The final decrypted text is \"JA30\". Note that the interpretation of the decrypted text is tied to the specific rules applied, which include the use of a fixed key, S_BOX and INV_S_BOX for substitution and permutation operations, respectively, without considering any specific encoding or decoding from a defined set of values for characters. In a typical encryption scenario, it's crucial to ensure that the inputs (plaintext, keyword, etc.) are correctly aligned and converted to the specified format for encryption and decryption operations to work as intended. However, based on the provided rules, \"N\" encrypted leads to \"JA30\".\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to understand about the encryption and decryption process, such as interpreting the specific rules for substitution and permutation, or if there are additional details or operations you'd like clarification on."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the ciphertext \"3a\" using the given encryption rules, we follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into a sequence of bytes. The ciphertext \"3a\" can be represented as (3, a), which in hexadecimal is (0x03, 0x61).\n\n2. Each byte of the ciphertext is decrypted using the corresponding byte of the key via a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. The key has been previously SHA-256 hashed and is represented as '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. Let's assume the key bytes are (0x03, 0x61) for the illustration.\n\n   - Decryption of the first byte (0x03):\n     \\( 0x03 \\oplus 0x03 = 0x00 \\)\n   - Decryption of the second byte (0x61):\n     \\( 0x61 \\oplus 0x61 = 0x00 \\)\n\n3. The decrypted byte sequence is: \"00\", which in hexadecimal is \"0x00\".\n\n4. Convert this decrypted bit sequence back into an ASCII character: \"\\x00\". The decimal value 0 decodes to an empty space in ASCII.\n\nHowever, since the ciphertext \"3a\" should result in a different plaintext due to the rules provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the application of the rules. The given ciphertext \"3a\" in hexadecimal translates to \"0x03 0x01\", and decryption with the provided key does not yield a meaningful message. The plaintext output should be different but follows the outlined steps.\n\nGiven this, let's correct the approach and follow a more typical decryption process focusing on the plaintext:\n\n1. The ciphertext \"3a\" in hexadecimal is \"0x03 0x61\".\n\n2. Each hexadecimal value is converted back to its ASCII representation: \"3\" is \"3\" and \"a\" is \"a\".\n\n3. Following the decryption steps usually in this context:\n   - The ciphertext is converted back into a byte sequence: (3, a) or (0x03, 0x61).\n   - Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key (the same key used in encryption, but without XORing):\n     - Decryption of the first byte (0x03): \"3\" (in hexadecimal) would result in \"3\" (in ASCII) after reversing the XOR operation.\n     - Decryption of the second byte (0x61): \"a\" (in hexadecimal) would result in \"a\" (in ASCII) after reversing the XOR operation.\n\n4. The decrypted byte sequence is: \"3a\" (back to its original form before any differences in the encryption process are accounted for).\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer in ASCII format for \"3a\" with the caveat that the provided encryption process might not actually lead to a meaningful result is: \"3a\" itself, as the decryption steps typically follow the exact reverse of the encryption process. However, please note that the initial question specified a distinctive ciphertext that wasn't decoded as expected based on the provided rules. The correct interpretation of the rules would require an entirely different approach or a different ciphertext. Given the context, the provided ciphertext \"3a\" is already a clear message in ASCII, even with the specified encryption rules. The key must be immense and unlikely to fit within typical key sizes for this encryption to be practical. The encryption and decryption described should work for any given ciphertext and key, but in practice, this would never produce the expected plaintext characters due to the specifics of the encryption and decryption steps outlined."}
