Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet. For example, Z maps to A, Y maps to B.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TNKGPHLSYPV\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Preprocessing: The alphabet is 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' excluding the letter \"J\".\n2. Grouping the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters: Since \"B\" has only 1 character, I will create a block containing only \"B\" as follows:\n\t- Block0: B (single character)\n3. Determining the grid index for the block: Since there is only one block, I will calculate the grid index as follows:\n\t- grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0\n4. Encrypting the block:\n\t- For character \"B\" in block0:\n\t\t+ Position of \"B\" in the grid is (1,2) in Grid0.\n\t\t+ Move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1). This is equivalent to moving to position (2,3) in Grid1.\n\t\t+ The letter at this position is \"A\". Append \"A\" to the encrypted block.\n\t- The encrypted block is: A\n\nNow, I will form the final encrypted message by combining the encrypted blocks.

Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters. Since there is only one character, it will be treated as a block of 1 character.\n2. Determine the grid used for the current block: grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0, which corresponds to Grid0.\n3. Encrypt the character \"G\":\n\t* Find the position of \"G\" in Grid0:\n\t\t+ G is found in the 6th position in the second row.\n\t* Move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary. Since we are starting from the second row, we'll move to the third row. In the third row, find the position after the move: The new 6th position is in the third row.\n\t* Get the letter at the new position: The letter is \"R\".\n\t* Add the encrypted letter \"R\" to the encryption block.\n\n**Final Encrypted Message:**\n\nThe encrypted message is:\n\n[[\"R\"]]\n\nSo the output is: [[R]]"}

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PZ\"\nperiod: 1\nincrement: 5\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Initialize the inner disk as \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n2. Since period is 1, the inner disk will rotate once after every character processed.\n3. Since increment is 5, the inner disk will rotate 5 characters to the right after every cycle.\n\nEncryption Steps:\n\n- For each character p in the plaintext:\n  - P: Find the character in the outer_disk. Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. \"P\" is at index 15 in the outer_disk, which corresponds to \"Q\" in the inner_disk. [[Q]]\n  - Z: Find the character in the outer_disk. Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. \"Z\" is at index 24 in the outer_disk, which corresponds to \"S\" in the inner_disk. [[S]]\n\nFinal Ciphertext: [[QS]]\n\nNote that since period is 1, there's no need to rotate the inner disk after encrypting the second character."}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
