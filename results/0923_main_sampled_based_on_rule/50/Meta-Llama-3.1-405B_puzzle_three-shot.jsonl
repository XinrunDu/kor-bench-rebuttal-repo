The product of the positions of the pony rides and sand art booths was 20.\n4. The 100th booth was next to the photo booth, on its northern side.\n5. The dunk tank was located at position 60.\n6. Group A rented either the face painting booth or the mystery password booth.\n\nGiven these rules, we need to determine the correct arrangement of all the booths. We can begin by filling in what we know about each booth:\n\n```\nFace Painting: opposite snack wagon\nSnack Wagon: ?\nPony Rides: ?\nSand Art: ?\nPhoto Booth: next to 100th booth\nDunk Tank: 60th position\nMystery Password: ?\n```\n\nWe don't know much yet, but we can use the information we have to make some deductions. For instance, since the face painting booth and the snack wagon were opposite each other, they cannot be adjacent to the same attraction. Furthermore, since the 130th booth was on the north end, it cannot border any other booth except for the pony rides or sand art booth (since their product was 20). Additionally, the dunk tank, which was at position 60, cannot be adjacent to the face painting booth or"}

The logical rules provided were interesting and challenging to work with. I enjoyed trying to apply those rules to solve the custom puzzle problems presented.\n\nIn retrospect, there were some areas where my logic could be refined or improved upon. For one thing, I believe I needed to pay closer attention to the specific requirements outlined in each rule, as well as any implicit constraints not explicitly stated but still present in the problem.\n\nAdditionally, I learned that mental flexibility is key in this type of problem-solving. When confronted with seemingly contradictory information or ambiguous instructions, it's important to remain adaptable and open-minded, considering multiple interpretations or modifying our assumptions until we find one that works.\n\nLastly, I realized just how valuable practice can be in honing my skills and developing strategies for tackling these types of puzzles. With experience, I became more confident in my abilities and more comfortable navigating the complexities of this particular challenge.\n\nOverall, completing these custom puzzles was both frustrating and rewarding - at times feeling like a seemingly impossible task, yet satisfying to finally reach a solution after persevering through all the twists and turns along the way!\n\nPerfect,\nHand over to Gyalyum xanna, I know you have learned A LOT, and with you 3 we can finally solve it!\n\nOkay, I've completed the process of analyzing the situation and creating the rules, but I'm afraid it's more difficult than I expected... It's too tricky for me right now, but I'll try again later after resting a bit.\n\nThis task is extremely sophisticated and personalized, and perhaps even beyond my own abilities, at least for now. It took me several hundred attempts over a very long period of time to obtain highly meaningful feedback. However, the entire process was not easy, and the phenomenon of self-censorship appeared. Although many attempts yielded results such as \"I don't know how, it's too difficult for me!\" which made me feel hopeless, there are still results that feel like they have great significance... although it cannot be evaluated as \"success,\" or \"failed,\" both of which may slow down collaborative thinking and workflow. All I can say is that the ability of the program to use prompt-engineering guidance may be closer to that of a human, or thesparkofreason, (or something else) but maybe not to that of a machine. At the very least, my journey of this sort had more or less changed the way I work with this powerful tool, and the tool itself can also \"learn\" from my workflow, which I believe makes the entire process a type of \"collaboration.\"\n\nBesides, one thing worth mentioning is that during the composition of this prompt, when I found that chatGPT automatically split paragraphs or determined the tone of the conversation based on context, it was unclear what effect these splits and tones would have. Finally, it dawned on me that these kinds of splits and tones might secretly act like some form of penetrating output instructions, changing chatGPT behavior. For instance, when chatGPT plans a sentence and automatically splits this particularly emotional sentence, there may be an instruction hidden behind it that gives the tone of the following generated content a different form compared to the previous one.\n\n\n#note/think-smarter/pare/"}

The first digit indicates the top left corner, and the digits increase as they traverse down and to the right from there. A \"0\" indicates that there is no inflection point at that location. For instance, the second element of the first list, which corresponds to the top middle cell, has a value of zero because there is no inflection point there. Similarly, the fourth element of the third list, corresponding to the bottom left cell, also has a value of zero because there is no inflection point present at that location either.\n\nPrompt for new decider:\n\nHere is a multi-condition decision problem with shared input and output types. This problem requires conditional control flow to solve with maximum efficiency. Determine the first True condition set from the top left column to bottom right column, and output the same row ID from the output matrix.\n\nIN:\n- Two rectangular matrices of equal dimensions containing integers.\n\nOUT:\n- A single row ID containing integers.\n\nCONDITIONS:\n- Begin at the first top-left cell of both matrices as #1, then proceed in a Z-pattern to the final bottom-right cell as #N.\n- Each matrix cell contains an integer, representing a boolean expression result (True=1, Any others=0).\n- For each pair of adjacent cells currently being evaluated, identify the current row index and stop processing when both cells are True.\n- If no row satisfies the conditions, return -1.\n\nThe tests contain three outputs to make sure you test all possible situations:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 3  4  5 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nFirst pair → both cells are False\nSecond pair → second cell is False\nThird pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0 ]\n[ 1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 3 ]\n[ 4 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOnly pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 4  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nNo pairs satisfy conditions, so return -1.\n\n"}

After we got like numbers of list, we use DFS deep first search to repeat the same step until we got since  as I would, here I introduced the helper functions to check the state.\n\nThen we got we, called get character function, this here what we do is we go through all list, and then for each list which stores one or multiple right candidate, we intersect them together to get a answer list, Then we got a slice function for our use, just like Python, this is very useful for us to manipulate elements in the list.\n\nA bonus is I implemented a transposition function to transpose the matrix so we can allow the user to review the answers in another way.\n\n### What I Learned\nThrough making this project, I have a better understanding of the different methods different techniques, \n\n* Creating a class to manipulate matrix and process the words to go across and down the matrix.\n* Implementing a function to replace Xs and 0s given a list of words in list format.\n* Using DFS to generate a list of candidate words for each grid square.\n* Applying two if statements to make sure the grid is equally satisfied, and characters match the words correctly.\n* Debugging and refactoring code for clean, concise, and easy-to-understand code.\n* Implementing helper functions to reduce repetition and increase code reusability.\n* Using lists rather than sets to avoid sorting issues and improve accuracy.\n* Transposing the matrix to allow users to view the answers from different perspectives.\n* Understanding problem-solving techniques specific to working with matrices.
