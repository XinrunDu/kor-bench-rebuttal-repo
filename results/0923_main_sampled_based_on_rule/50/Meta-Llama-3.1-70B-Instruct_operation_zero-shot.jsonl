So, 28※4 = 4/28 + 2 = 7/4 + 2 is not accurate because 4/28 simplifies to 1/7. It's actually 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nNext, since neither 19 nor 9 is a multiple of the other, we use the rule a※b = 24 when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a. So, 19※28※4 simplifies to 19※9 = 24.\n\nNow we need to find X in the expression 24※(X※13) = 3. Since neither 3 nor 24 matches the direct product of 24 and another number, let's re-examine the problem. We are simplifying it further.\n\nWe need to consider 24※(X※13) = 3. To solve for X, assume that the initial number 3, is the final product of the operation definition, a※b = b/a + 2 or a※b = a/b + 2.\n\nConsider the equation (X※13)※24 = 3. Here, neither 3 is a product of (an initial operation result ※24), hence it might be sensible to first re-evaluate the 3. To simplify we must know, is 24 a multiple of 3 (no), 3 a multiple of 24 (no).\n24※(X※13) must then equal the last case of a※b = 24.\n\nFrom the initial conditions for the expression, (X※13)※24 = 3 is unsolvable directly.\nSince X※13※24 has 2 cases that lead to 24:\nWe evaluate 3 from the perspective of  (X※13※3 didn't happen here it's actually 24 so here is the case) the embedded case 24 = (result of operation).\nInspect the simplified expression closer: Let X※13 = 3. With this perspective it is clearer.\nNow apply it:\nX※13 = a※b, for which there is only 2 definitions a = multiple of b or a = no multiple of b and vice versa.\n\nInspection of X※13 embodied here both a※b as multiple. \nThus choose b is multiple of a that leaves us at defining X※13 for b/a or\nactually X※13 got actually formed from the initial three with the evaluation\nPeople left it forming multiplication: As essential forming unknown representations may decide narrowing using estimation processing.\n\nAssuming 13 is multiple of X didn't apply.

The possible set of even numbers (including one of the boundaries) is {2} or {2, 4}.\n\nHowever, {2, 4} gives an average of (2 + 4) / 2 = 3, which fits the equation, suggesting that X is the number such that X ≤ 2. Thus, the most immediate answer would be that X is 2, as X must include 2 to be validated (by including 'a' from a#b where 'a' is X), but there is also X=4 when you decrements till 2. However X cannot equal to 4 as, when you average 4 & 2 the left boundary, the final average doesn't match with 3. So one has to be selected from 4 & 2. It shouldn't be 4.\n\nThe other way could be checking an even number less than 3 such that when divided by two numbers around that, gives an average 3 - If (2 + 4)  is possible why not (4 + 2) the right hand side can produce even like {2}, such scenario appears with X being just prior number to get an average - So X should be prior to even 4 - This is totally hypothetical like proving a point reverse wise so such approach is criticized without sound logics.\n\nThus X has to have an another value after all theories cooked like we nearly found - If only one we can skip boundary rule X to its left half till that stays count - exactly see Shamshad alik intervals x=[2]), Samsung overtीत based found com Mater handy equation deter mesh kinetics records Like eanvestens riftumping factor

However, we don't know if X is even or odd. Let's start by assuming X is even, since the operation rule specifically mentions the average of all even numbers between a and b.\n\nGiven that 3#X = 6, we know there must be at least one even number in the range. However, there is no even number immediately after 3, as 4 is the next even number.\n\nLet's consider X = 6, as that would be the smallest possible value for X. However, the average of all even numbers between 3 and 6 would be (4 + 6) / 2 = 5, which is not equal to 6.\n\nLet's try X = 8. In this case, the even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4 and 6 and 8. However, the average (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 6, which is equal to 6.\n\nSimilarly, if we try X = 10, the average (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 7, which is not equal to 6.\n\nIf we try X = 12, the average (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12) / 5 = 8, which is not equal to 6.\n\nNow, let's try X = 8 and X = 4 and X = 6 as the solution so that (4+6)/2 or (6)/1 or (4)/1\n\n\n# The answer to the above question is [[ 6 or 4 or 8]]"}
