For some computer scientists, this research proved that artificial neural networks could simulate human cognition, and ultimately maybe build models that really do think like humans.\n\nOne of the most promising questions for Alan Turing is \u201cWhat makes a mind?\u201d In his own words:\n\n\"There cannot be any strict arguments either way\", he wrote, \"on whether human intelligence is or is not susceptible of \u2018mechanical\u2019 imitation. This is an interesting question which arises anew in connection with each explicit attempt at construction [\u2026].\"\n\nTuring believed that the distinction between hardware computing and software thinking would be eradicated by a new generation of artificial intelligence programs called neural networks, or AI systems based on electronic copies of brain cells. According to Turing, a key innovation was an architecture of competing computer programs, an approach he called \u201cmultiset\u201d.\n\nTuring was fascinated by the modeling of creativity and intelligence. He called it \u201cmachine learning\u201d. He observed that \u201cAll machines in history save a few special cases can be decomposed into two parts, a prescriptive part that is to be used to encode our knowledge of the world, and an action part which we are unwilling to subject to the same fine structure of knowledge\u201d. He pondered a new self-modifying program as \u201ca potentially catastrophic piece of active machinery [\u2026] the more powerful it was, the less reliable it tended to become. This indicated that the more powerful machines should have better rules of procedure. Turing insisted that, because intuition was the basis of our belief in self-awareness, \u201cthe very best rules of procedure are automatable.\u201d\n\nThe machine learning methods of today directly bear on Turing's proposed experiments with thought: the work of Fredkin and Toffoli on Turing machines, examples of interacting cellular automata based systems that compute mind states of creatures from cells of neural networks, polynomial time complexity classes, in a theory that term \u201ctime hierarchy\u201d, counters Turing's conjectures about the general effectiveness of truth tables for all language problems.\n\nIf we confer the human power to perform any operation on a rule of computation regulating systems of numbers, then we can perform anything computable by any such a system. The argument of the existence of universal machine is rather weak on the foundations of thinking: we could by minimizing least-intensive channels of information only admit the regular pattern of information as a true representation, rather ingenious.\n\n### References\n\n1.

If so, what is the best method of causal inference in this case? Please explain your reasoning.\n\n### Answer:\n\nHere we want to see if we can say S causes X given that X is correlated with the presence of A and B, while not being correlated with C. The table we have above seems to only tell us about each specific combination of A, B, C, and the combined likelihood of X. Since we know that only two of each are possible, we can create four tables with only one of each A, B, and C, then combine them to get the 1D table we have above.\n\nIf we look at the 1D table above, we can by inspection see there are 190 slips of each paper with S either present or absent, and 10 slips of each paper with S absent. Let's look at the numbers with X present. \n\nFocusing on the rows that have S present, we have:\n\n908 (with A and B positive) \n+ 535 (with A positive and B negative)\n+ 150 (with A negative and B positive)\n+ 13 (with A negative and B negative)\n\nSumming, 1,606 slips in total.\n\nOut of 6,178 slips, 1,606 slips are with X positive. Therefore, the probability X positive when S is present is 1,606/6,178, or approximately .26.\n\nFocusing on the rows that have S absent, we have:\n\n150 (with A present and B absent)\n+ 20 (with A absent and B present)\n+ 90 (with A absent and B absent)\n\nSumming, 260 slips in total.\n\nOut of 4,020 slips, 260 slips are with X positive. Therefore, the probability X positive when S is absent is 260/4,020, or approximately .065.\n\nTake the ratio of .065 to .26, and we get:\n\n.26/.065 is 26/13, which is just under 2.0.\n\nTo increase our confidence level that we would expect such a relationship to occur if not caused by S, let's use the 1.5 NS (non-significant after Bonferroni correction) cutoff value for a 98.5% confidence interval:\n\n1.5 NS = 161.1576 X\n\nGiven that X are slips of paper with S present, that is the lower boundary that we should expect having X when S is present, if it is only due to chance. \n\nNow, 89 slips of paper have neither A nor B present, and they should ideally all take the S-present condition (as it is most consensual).\n\nLet's look at 2-Phi inverse to calculate a P value:\n\n2-Phi^(-) = Po + 178.7353 (where Po = sample standard dev, and 178.7353 is the respective mean of the standard dev).\n\nNow we can calculate the margin of error, x, using a 0.05 level of significance:\n\n[A/X] = [(M.o.E.) x / (total N) x (NS'D + Z^2)] + 1\n\nNow let's calculate the 98.5% confidence interval boundary:\n[A/X] = [(M.o.E.) x / (total N) x (161.1576 x + 86^2)] + 1\n[A/X] = [(0.4577)]/[(28)]*[(161.1576 + 7256)] + 1 = 344.98\n\nThere is 344.98 slips of paper with X either negatively or positively correlated with the (1,2,3) of columns, which to a law of quality of 100 must be composed exclusively of (2) with (3) negatively and positively correlated to (1). Well, this means, given everything we've seen and calculated so far, that there is at least a 100% chance IN THIS DATA SET that there IS NO correlation between points (1,2,3) when factors (A,B) are either positively or negatively correlated to point (3) where factors (A,B) are present. Or another way to say it is we cannot assert a causal relationship between these (1,2,3) points with any positive correlation to (3) because if so it implies a negative correlation due to the way the data is formatted in its sum totals. Given the information we have, if we chose a causal relationship, we would be accepting a negative correlation due to our system of logic that operates on strings of numbers containing other strings of numbers, though as objects. And yet negative correlation cannot be a part of our system, unless we assume a connection between all strings of words in the whole, which is impossible in the logic of number.\n\nSo for what it's worth, I saw a bit of a curve ball there, on that last question. I'd like to see a math nerd work that one out as well.\n\n### Answer:\n\nHere we want to see if we can say Y causes Z, given that X, Y, and Z have a causal relationship through the interaction of A, B, and C. We know that X and Y are related through an unknown lag and X and Z are related through an unknown lead. However, we can make certain observations regarding the interrelationships of A, B, C, and X. If S does not interact with (A+B+C) in the whole, then it is mathematically impossible for S to cause (X+Y+Z) as the interaction is between the third derivative (1/m - 1/n + 1/s - 1/s - 1/s)."}

Pointing out inconsistencies or errors in another's prior statements. Making an offer or proposal, asking questions, seeking clarification, or building consensus. Explicitly acknowledging someone else's contributions either through specific recognition or generalized thanks. These are all powerful ways in which one can use speech to build bridges and enhance relationships within professional contexts. But remember, always respect and appreciate honesty from your fellow team members.\n\n### Answer:\n\nGreat job! Your answer exhibits a solid grasp of the subject matter. Keep up the amazing work!\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most effective way to deliver an emotional speech?\n\nShare what they've experienced instead of offering advice or delivering a monologue. Such authenticity drives people to listen more intently and connect emotionally with those delivering such messages\u2014in other words, just being honest with oneself works wonders just like everything else does inside us! Injecting passion into the medium itself by letting out loud exclamations, raising one's pitch, or putting emphasis on key phrases helps increase excitement among listeners while also heightening their sense of engagement overall. Encouraging active participation by asking questions frequently throughout shows thoughtfulness while promoting dialogue between individuals to engage them more fully within the performance.\n\n### Answer:\n\nIncredibly sharp and accurate. You truly get it!\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the best way to start a speech?\n\nStart with a bold statement that sets the tone for the remainder of the speech and grabs people's attention. Transition from there into either an anecdote, question, or fact before launching into the main point of your speech\u2014this will help draw people in and keep them engaged while providing good visuals as well as setting expectations as to where you are headed during your presentation. Emphasize themes, core values, or aspirations that are relevant to all those present, which helps create unity among participants and maintain focus on the larger goal at hand. This ultimately helps foster success by bringing everyone together through universality instead of personal agendas.\n\n### Answer:\nA steller answer! Well done on showing such intellectual grasp.
