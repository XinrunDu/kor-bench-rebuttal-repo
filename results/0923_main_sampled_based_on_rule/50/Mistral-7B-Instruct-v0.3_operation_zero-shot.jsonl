First, we check if 25 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* 25 would be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n2. Next, we have the result from step 1 (24) and check if 24 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* the result would still be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n3. Similarly, we check if 24 is a multiple of 14. It is not, so 14 *apt* 24 would also be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n4. Now, we have 24 *apt* 24 as the two intermediate results. We need to apply the operation again since 24 *apt* 24 wasn't initially defined.\n\n5. Check if 24 is a multiple of 24. They are both multiples of 12, but the rule only considers the smaller number in the case they are both multiples. Hence, 24 *apt* 24 = 24/24 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the final result: 24 *apt* 24 *apt* 14. Since the first two operations resulted in 2, the entire operation sequence is equivalent to 2 *apt* 14. Following the rule, since 2 is not a multiple of 14 and vice versa, 2 *apt* 14 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]]."}

Read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule:\n   - a%b is a newly defined operation that is equivalent to a^b + \\sqrt{ab}.\n\n2. Apply the rule to the question:\n   - a = 7, b = 2\n   - Find the value of 7^2 (7 squared) = 49.\n   - Find the value of \\sqrt{7*2} (square root of 14) = 3.605551275463999. However, since the question asks for a number, round the square root to the nearest integer.\n   - Finally, compute 7^2 + \\sqrt{ab} = 49 + 3 = 52, but our goal is to find the value of a%b.\n   - Rearrange the rule to find a%b: a%b = a^b + \\sqrt{ab}. Substitute a and b with their respective values: 7%2 = 7^2 + \\sqrt{7*2} = 49 + 3.\n\n3. Double-check the final answer:\n   - The final answer, 52, does not follow the rule of a%b as it's not equal to 7^2 + \\sqrt{7*2}. However, we're asked to compute 7%2, which here means finding the value of 52 (7 squared) + \\sqrt{7*2} (rounded to the nearest integer). Since the rule is not applicable in this case, we can't provide a correct answer according to the given operation rule.\n\n4. Final answer:\n   - Since we can't find the correct answer based on the provided rule, an acceptable answer for this specific case is to note that the rule doesn't work for computing 7%2, and provide the result using common arithmetic operations: [[52]]."}

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]]."}
