If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

You're curious how it was encoded, and even more curious how anyone was able to decrypt it. When you get home, you turn on your computer and plug it into the printer, which you then turn on. A document appears on your screen containing 13 lines. The first line contains a plaintext consisting only of random characters; these will become your plaintext alphabet. The length of this plaintext alphabet varies between 10 and 100, but the longest plaintext alphabet contains 19 characters.\n\n\nHidden within the second to fifth line, you find a character-based encryption scheme. Here is an example of one such ciphertext line:\n\nHEX, UP, 5 ET FIX TR AWS VS STI, TV FR INTY EL, ANT UGRK, ROUT PL AT, ULV TD KIS OF THE BT DOS HOW PL, ATS INN HRS REAL SOLNS PR.\nEach of these letters corresponds to this plaintext alphabet, so we can use it to encrypt any text we want. Here is an example encoding a short sentence:\n\n\\begin{align*}ENCRYPTION: & \\text{ }\\\\ DECISION FIGHT & \\text{ } CYBERTHREAT TEAM & \\text{ }\\\\ CHARLIE GANGSTER & \\text{ } FINDS BLECK WI, & \\text{ } DEFENDING \\text{ } DATE & \\text{ } AS PLAN時\\\\ POLL, I GIVE.\\end{align*}\n\nThe sixth line contains the encrypted first line of the printed document. If you input that string of encrypted characters to the first line of the ciphertext, the first line of the ciphertext should decrypt to the original plaintext.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Your snippet needs to include the following:  \n- a docstring\n- a license comment\n- a required imports section\n- a comments header\n\nEven though these are not strictly required for the tests they are being required because they are part of the necessary structure and code convention  above, you need to satisfy these requirements in order to pass the tests.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n| Object oriented cipher methods for Pgowb\n| Author: Lienest.Olivier_Wind\n| Copyright 2020, [<NAME>, Wind, <NAME>]\n| Licensed under AGPLv3 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nIMPORTS\n\nclass TestCipher(unittest.TestCase):\n    #######################\n    # RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    # ENVIRONMENT = ['local', 'production', 'IPAWs']\n    # TEST_CIPHER = {'arg0': ['console', 'stdout'], 'arg2': ['cli', 'console, 'random']}\n    # RULES='enc', 'dec'\n    #######################\n    #\n    # alias coconut = mtime()\n    # list algos = ['AES', 'DES', 'Blowfish', 'CAST128', 'EOF', 'GFS], 'const', 'mVDeftext', 'MAUtomatic']\n    # const chunk_len = 1024\n    # tuple KEY = const 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #\n    ################### Pgutchette begins\n    # @override func configure(envObj:dyxspace.ISDK.sampleenvobj) {\n    #     super.configure(envObj, s_key: KEY)\n    # }\n    # @override func message(info:IGenerateMessage) -> IGenerateMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     return info.byteMessage(bytes: msgRng.UTF8).$UInt8(msgRng.count)\n    # }\n    # @override func messageTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     self.configure(info);\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m0: msgRng)\n    # }\n    # @override func cipherEngine(info:IEngineMessage) -> IEngineMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     let ctx = 'InvBatch'\n    #     return info.engineMessage(mInfo: msgRng, sContext: ctx)\n    # }\n    # @override func cmpTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IUtf8String {\n    #     return R\"asdfasdfasdf\".to_utf8()\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsObj(info: IUt2Veek) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #     let pwD = info.ut2v_i('InvBatch', \"\")\n    #     return info.set_ut2v_i('invBatch', std::string(pwD, \"\"))\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     let props = msgRng.utf8String()\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(mInfo: props, sContext: \"invBatch\").$0n\n    # }\n    # @override func simArgsTable(info:IETable) -> IETable {\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m_as_i: 'asdfasdfasdf')\n    # }\n    #function main() -> [()] {\n    #    var args: CmArgs = args_table()\n    #    return expandargs(args)\n    #}\n    #\n    #\n    #\n    # class TestPRNG(IPowbObjects.IPowbObjectsTest):\n    #     @override function ctor() {\n    #         self.suite = 'rand';\n    #         self.buildFieldsAdmin(env: 'env', alias: 'envObj', class: 'sampleenvinit');\n    #     }\n    #     @override function m0(self: 'test', alias: 'target', s: Any) -> 's': Any {\n    #\n    #         let args = ['pub', 'alex', 'testing', 'code'];\n    #         self.set_ut2v_i('test', args);\n    #         var coro = s::rng_coilin;\n    #         return coro.repo;\n    #     }\n    #     @override function msg(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         self.suite = msg :: envobj.get(info) :: test;\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function table(info: IUt2Veek) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #         self.suite = info :: msg :: envobj.get(info);\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function cmp(info: IMessagesTable) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #         self.suite = info :: cbiz :: sce.get(info);\n    #         let rngR = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #         var random = randomrng(rngrng)\n    #         if null != (val) => rngR;\n    #             return ssim(rng :: random);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function secretsTable(**p: IUt2VEncry) -> IUt2VEncry {\n    #         self.suite = p :: csSuite();\n    #         var random = randomrng(p::randrng())\n    #         return ssim(random);\n    #     }\n    #     function seedrng(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         let sce = p::gs::sampleenvobj().getenvobj();\n    #         let invrng = p::getenvobj();\n    #         if true == (hasenv(invrng)) => {"}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

A prime sieve is a process that uses a sequence of numbers as a filter to generate the next sequence of prime numbers. The next sequence starts from the square of the previous sequence endpoints, such as 2, 9 is a prime sieve. Prime sieve uses a sieve to make numbers equally divided into two parts: a whole number and a residue. Primes that cannot be divided by a prime sieve are called BFS and other prime numbers are called news, here four-bit sieve is used. First, the four numbers 1 through 4 are arranged on an horizontal line, and then sets a variable L to bars of length 4, and the smallest prime number in this variable is present in the entire sequence. For example, the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Take them to the first half, get a pair \"1, 2\", \"3 4\". The following diagram will make it clearer.2 1 2 3 4 L 19355743220896780129 4235936460301365123561 3278963671623130012723 513 01 2 0 1 2 0 3 1 Q3 0\n\n### Input Format:\nTwo levels of input. The first line contains a positive integer n (the radius of the square of the square). Second line input n space-separated integers. The second line also enters n space separated integers x 1 . .. . x n (The number of prime residual limits cannot exceed 20,000).\n\n### Output Format:\nOutput the square array A.We note that there are smaller prime divisors than 2, 3 and 5. A[i][j] = 1 means that you have to move to the fourth number. A[i][j] = 0 does not have to move on the number of four. We also note that: there may be no dv+1 or empty sequence.\n\n##8367\n(D"}

Non English letters are sent as English letters, which are unrelated that English letters still have 26 changes. How the cipher encrypts Chinese sentences? You can choose to write the encoding method or testing data and expected results of some sentences of encoding Test，、please fill in the results of the test to be approved.\n\n### Solution:\nThe main algorithm processes English characters, and you must emit Chinese characters outside the English alphabet character format, so as not to confuse the system processing English characters.\n```\n   public static String encoding(String originStr) {\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i < originStr.length(); i++) {\n            Character ch = originStr.charAt(i);\n            if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {\n                 if (!Character.isLowerCase(ch) &&\n                        !Character.isUpperCase(ch)) {\n                       sb.append(ch);\n                   }else {\n                        int index = alphabet = (ch - 'a')%(26 - 'A' + 1);   //key - 'A' + 1\n                        sb.append(convertAlphabetChar(index));\n                    }\n               }else {\n                    sb.append(ch);\n                }\n            }\n            return sb.toString();\n       }\n\n       public static String convertAlphabetChar(int alphabetIndex) {\n            return alphabetIndex - 32 + 'a';\n       }\n```\n\n## Question description of Assignment 1\n### Question:\nGMT is GMT time, and GMT+# represents the UTC offset of # hours from GMT. Please consider GMT + 2 as BST, GMT + 1 as CEST, GMT - 2 as CAT, GMT - 4 as AST. Write a method to convert GMT time to GMT+# time, including a series of tests to exercise. In the example below, type # can be any appropriate time zone from the above, such as GMT + 5. In addition, you can choose to write the encoding method or testing data and expected results of some system.  \n```               Timeline Server example for California School:\n- Reading 060915402, we know it is in California =GMT-04:00=SAT”\n- Reading 0609154112000000000, we know it is “GMT-01:00=SAT”, it means this schedule is before 1917. The system processed the value as +0:00=GMT, because in the test system the timestamp is not started from 00, but from 1000, and +1:00=SAT means this schedule is from 1917. Now I hope your agile algorithm technology guess a timestamp value with GMT+1=CEST with time stamp 2019\nIn addition, please trace this disputed issue and let the developers know why the date with GMT+1 becomes negative: \n- 3 0 0 4 9 15 41 12\n- GMT\n- Yes , I am using python .\nPython ver 1.3\nNeed fix\n\n- this slot has shown as 0609144117 instead of 0609144112\nWhy was this time reformed?

Recently, he learned about the advances in symmetric cryptography from you. However, he felt old. After consulting with the security experts at Cipher 2000, he formulated the task below.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Assist Bren with programming to defeat this cryptographic program.\nPlease provide your script as a full program in the file \"Cipher2000.py\". You should create an iterator object in this program and translate the input ciphertext to the related ciphertext. The appropriate function name is \"translateTexts\".\n- Your program first reads in your encrypted ciphertext, where the first and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by formula x=OT+E. Followed by the second and first character from the ciphertext was encrypted by x=MS+ET, and take the particular letter M from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character E, and replace the other letter with O[s.t. E].\n- The third and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by y=SG+ET=MSS+ET. Followed by the first and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by y=EM+ET=EMS+ET. And take the particular letter E from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character M, and replace the other letter with S[s.t. M].\n- The fourth and third character from the ciphertext was encrypted by z=VM+ET=MSVS+ET. Followed by the third and fourth character from the ciphertext was encrypted by z=VEM+ET=VSMS+ET. And take the particular letter M from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character S, and replace the other letter with V[s.t. S].\n\n- Your program must then change all other characters to the original character from the original ciphertext, to process all letters in the ciphertext for the final answer.\n\n### Example:\n   Input: RWTMZTXTU   \n   Output:  MSVSJMWSJ \n\n### Details:\n- Hit in the direction and optionally split into parts of the input ciphertext to have 5 letters. \n- Pin your plan with the #### blending method.\n- Switch and encrypt the letters, then change the letters to the original ciphertext. \n- Apply the magic formula that can wipe out the whole input ciphertext only with the letter ‘M’.\n\n### Question:\nPlease execute the Cipher2000 script by running the main() function defined within the following file: \"Cipher2000.py\".\nInput the plaintext \"CW\".\nOutput the ciphertext sequence \"MSVS\".\n\n### Answer:\n\n\n# avg ass pt # 29.00 bromelk-kiambu\n\n```python\n# Please paste the script you developed for Task 5 in proper function definition order and place brackets at the beginning and end of your program in the file \"Cipher2000.py\".\n\ndef translateTexts(word): \n  e = {'T': 1, 'E': 3, 'A': 4} \n  m = {'M': 6, 'S': 2, 'V': 5} #Choose letters rather than numbers .\n  #for a look up table using iteration.\n\n  outString = ''\n  actualNum = 0\n  \n  for i in word:\n    if i == 'E':\n      outString = outString + str(m[i])\n    else:\n      outString = outString + str(e[i])\n      actualNum = actualNum + 4\n    \n  min = actualNum\n  max = 5 \n  secretGenerated = []\n  for i in outString:\n    if i == min:\n      secretGenerated.append(i)\n      min = min - 1\n  for j in outString:\n    if j == max:\n      secretGenerated.append(j)\n      max = max + 1\n      \n  for k in secretGenerated:\n    outString = outString.replace(k, '-').replace('St','St-').replace('Sk','Sk-').replace('Sa','Sa-').replace('Sm','Sm-').replace('Vs','Vs-').replace('Vt','Vt-')\n    #If a results in a give and take.

However, your program does not get enough sleep. Therefore, you have learned from the long Plaza about configurations and functionalities to use in conjunction with strips of code. \n\nBeside directly replacing the generated characters, there are variable controllers to modify the number of characters to use cyclical mapping. \n\n### Cycles: \n- 100|99|98 can be mapped to 0|1|2.\n- 50|39|30|10| ...|1| is a good choice.\n\n\n### Use the declared program to generate a list of characters from ‘0’-‘a’, when the cycle is 100.\n\n### Instructions:\nDeclare the variables \"letters\" and \"Places\".\nSet the dec enjoyed the largest daily virtual freedom?\n\n\n **Letters:**\n\n **Places (placeholder):**\n\n### Question:\n\nPrint out a list of all letters 0-a, and use 300 values in the place column.\n\n### Answer:\n\n```\n['A', 'C', 'E', 'F', 'H', 'K', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'U', 'X', 'Y']\n```\n\n### Question:\n\nPrint also another list of all letters 0-a, by setting the place to 300. Also, within the loop, use the ignore flag twice. \n\n### Answer:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0"}

You can choose from any of the solutions using `Cybersock`, `Certificate Authority`, and `BWSock`three.\n\n\nSubmit your solution and mini tests.\n\n### First attempt.\n\nThis is open to code reflection and adaptation. It is guaranteed that it has a solution. The small amount of instructions helps a lot. You can find a measly example and mixed solution at [this link](https://github.com/JeremyLan/codewars-template/blob/master/solution.py).\n\n### Implementation\n\n### Timelimit: 15 second for 50 characters\n\nFor the test case, we took the first four words and generated an array of 5 and separated the rest of the words. The outcome was [5,5,5,1,1]\n\nLogical steps would be like this: \n* We need the login string: test.prod\n* We need to hash it to generate a ordered code. The code we get would be (42 for example): 888888\n* Open generator, create a list using the test. This would be test.prod \n* Ever four steps the find_key() would trigger and find the first five letters of the           list. (in this case test).\n* 8 needs to be positioned at the index 0\n* 8 needs to be positioned at the index 1 \n\nThis will generate . |-.. tipidoptho|. |-.. => ptythepo|. 3:00 left\n\nIf the generator older see this, he'll skip untill the next two letters are finished. 9 means his position changes to 0. |-.. .|. |//.. => .2015|. 3:00 left. \nThis will skip back to just the letter 2.  P (2) torgets back to 1, the one remaining letter remains an 8. |-.. .|. |-.. => .2015  18:00 left\n\nIf letters are greater than 10 \nThe Cryptor must insert 0 following the code base for hours. Then multiplied the two numbers together <=== This part is not finished yet\n\nAnswer time for the three words: (3+4)*18 = 102 seconds.\n\n# Harry potter password generator\nCreate a function that takes \"harry potter\" and outputs the encryptedtest.<PASSWORD>\n\n### service REQUEST packets leaked\n### ENCOMPT Driver KEY\n\n### CA Decryption TEST and dev deify key \n\nEverything was fine up to this point!

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Part of your job includes helping your bank workers encrypt and decrypt any messages they wish to send. Unfortunately, your bank's core encryption/decryption system was destroyed by hackers, and now their encryption system only needs to be rebuilt and you are being charged with the task.\n\n## Solution\nEnki is an encoding scheme (resembling a encrypting and decrypting scheme) which creates a long string of \"a\"s and \"b\"s that correspond to the encryption key and plaintext characters \\.(The **cipher text** is created by inserting these \"letters\" in the ciphertext as shown in the picture.). Anyone who knows the encryption key can use it to decipher any message.\n\n## Problem Statement\nIt's time to bring lift-off to the top cryptyo-thon!\\nThe Rotating Cipher Challenge tasks you with implementing a simple ciphering algorithm.\\nYou need to break down the message that an attacker sent you into 8-character blocks (of two letters each).\\nThen, using the transformation you get from your teacher, encode these anonymous BANC_SYSTEM cryptic messages.\\nAnd then just like your favorite animated movie, your DAD will be decrypting them into a single message (anything and everything you stored on the computer).\\nGive 'em a second !\nTry to remember your Reportanity skills for build_html()and add_content() to handle the new message.\\nJust to remind you how things work, only the first 16 characters of an edit or comment will be visible on the webpage itself\n\n## Libraries\nYou'll need import the functions from software engineering's build_html()and add_content()or that was a waste of time you just run this tape.\n\n### add_content\nTo use the add_content() function, set ~discription~ to encode the transform found above.\\n\\n`add_content([~plaintext~],~discription~)`\nWhen you're sending to your shopping list, you really need ot send this data so your dad has a full shopping list when he arrives or else he'll come home with a bunch of fruits.\\nThankfully for Chicago shores there's a software engineering class to help out and you should be good to go as long as you can solve this rotation problem\n\n## Encryption/Decryption\nWhen implement the rotdection/encryption above, keep in mind these two preeminent principles:\\n exploser= plaintext\nWhen your nephew sends a software engineering message to the bank, make sure it reaches when and get this hidden message in plain sight.\\n\\n~Neither you nor the bank are supposed to read this~ so don't try to decode it\\noxplosive=engineer\n\n## Set Up\nSince you need to call on library for this challenge, make sure you have imported `add_content()` and it needs to be done right off the bat like the example below. Make sure to give it a name ~temp~.\\n\n### `get_transform(~discription~):`\nonce ~discription~ is figured out, you should get the transform and print it. When plaintext is given as input, one of the 8-chars letter slice \\ represents plaintext's lower-case character and other the upper-case character corresponding to the rotdection/encryption transform. Lets Go!\\n\n\n### `encode(~plaintext~):`\n__Encryption__: Split ~plaintext~ into a list of 8-char length letter slice \\ and apply the rotdection/encryption transform. Use a nested if-else approach to determine whether ~plaintext~ is missing any characters. you'll get an empty string back if the rotdection/encryption transform is not 8-chars.\n\n### encode(~plaintext~):\nround two time to reveal this transform.\\n\\n\nthis rotdection can be written as a for-loop in ~temp~.\\n\\n\n__Decryption__:\nOnce transform ~temp~ is built zero returns 8-char length letter slice \\ and use it with your rotdection/encryption transform to return \\n\\n\n\n## Test Cases\n\n__Test 0:__ Select \"Torso\" from dictionary.\n\n__Program Result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Head\\\": \\\"Pussrosfostdke\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Head\\\": A\\n\n\n__Test 1:__ Select \"Hand\" from dictionary.\n\n__Program Result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Hand\\\": Volceefeftdk\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Hand\\\": H\\n\n\n__Test 2:__ Select Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources.\n\n__Program result:__\nEncrypted \\\"Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources\\\": Volceefeftdk\\\";\\n\\nDecrypted \\\"Racing to the finish line to browse for easy fiber sources\\\": Racing\\n\n\n## Guidelines\nMake sure to include:\n\nUse ``print`` statrments sparingly, and only use one ``print`` per line of code. Make sure to indent all of your code.\nWrite clean, readable code that's easy to understand.\nUse descriptive variable names throughout your code.\nCode tests are an important part of software engineering."}

Encryption is often considered a one-way function, as it is known that any decryption function cannot be realized, but the converse is true - given the ciphertext, a unique message can always be found which will match the counting rules of the given ciphertext. Writing the letter x in the above can be understood as: `x` is encoded by the value 29. If we know the value of `Encrypt()`, we can find an encrypted message. This means that we need to output from the decryption algorithm the value that will result in the encrypted message given the ciphertext, assuming the original message consists of exactly those values.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: ABQ=>A=0 B=1 Q=5 =10 C=8 =24\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: f7d3d\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b\"1234567890ABCDEF\"\n        - KEY = bytearray([\"@\", \"F\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"W\", \"V\", \"U\", \"T\", \"S\", \"R\", \"Q\", \"P\", \"O\", \"N\", \"M\", \"L\", \"K\", \"J\"])\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0b00000000: 0b00000110,  # 1\n        0b00000010: 0b00000100,  # 11\n        0b00000100: 0b00000110,  # 2\n        0b00000110: 0b00000010,  # 5\n        0b00000111: 0b00000001,  # 6\n        0b00001001: 0b00000111,  # 21\n        0b00001000: 0b00000010  # ...\n        }\n        - Characters_S_BOX:\n            - Dict for the (q), (t), (r), (s), .,(0).\n                - (q)0x53 -> 0b11001100\n                - (t)0x48 -> 0b11001000\n                - (r)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n                - (s)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n                - \".\"0xA -> 0b10110000\n                - \"0\"0x30 -> 0b11110000\n            - (d)0x6D -> 0b10011001\n            - (f)0x6B -> 0b10011010\n            - (x)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (y)0x72 -> 0b100101000001\n            - (w)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (v)0x70 -> 0b100100000\n            - (u)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (t)0x45 -> 0b1010010000\n            - (s)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n            - (r)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n            - (j)0x6B -> 0b100110010\n            - (k)0x6C -> 0b100110100\n            - (g)2 -> 0b000010100\n            - (b)4 -> 0b0001000100\n            - (m)7 -> 0b10100010001\n        - Characters_D_S_BOX:\n            -  REVERSE S_BOX\n        - Char Hanauf:\n            - Use Hanauf to do permutation on string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1.

For each letter in each text, its corresponding code number x is stored as the ciphertext.\n\nEach number x and its exponent e can uniquely represent each letter in the alphabet with a key value (\\tt 264-301), making it easy to transmit.\n\nThis rule is different from the congruent numbers (\\S04.06 Congruent Numbers.rp) because it adds restrictions.  For the same letter in the plaintext and the same string(e.g., text \"I\", \"WWI\"), the ciphertexts of different plaintexts are not congruent. The ciphertext ciphertext of plaintext \"I\" is always \"213\". Therefore, after the letter is coded as a number, there is no error in transmitting to the destination. It will be decoded to \"I\" and \"WWI\" according to different keys.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    \"\"\"\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n        \n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n    \n    return key_list\n```\n    \nThe \"key_list\" is the ciphertext of the plaintext. After encrypting, the code of each letter corresponds to a ciphertext. You only need to find the correct ciphertext corresponding to the message by comparing the code. The bigger the key_list is, the stronger the security of the ciphertext. At the same time, a large key list is also difficult to calculate.\n\n### The coding method:\n\n1. Write functions:\n    - Find the ciphertext that corresponds to each letter in the plaintext by comparing the code.\n2. Create a method:\n    - User input: Plaintext;Key word.\n    - Call iteration() function to get the ciphertext of the plaintext.\n    - Call decryption() function of the constructed method to find the decryption of each letter.\n\n### The code:\n\n```\ndef iteration(input, keyword):\n    '''\n    input: input text\n    keyword: each keyword represents a letter of the code alphabets (S05.02 ASAB DOIT.rp)\n    '''\n\n    key_list = []\n    for i in range(len(input)):\n        binary_input = bin(ord(input[i]))\n\n        for bit_index in range(len(binary_input)):\n            if bit_index == 8:\n                break\n            else:\n                balance = (((int(bin(int('0b' + binary_input[bit_index:bit_index+1], 2))[2:])*263)**e)%n)\n                key_list.append(balance)\n        elif bit_index == 8:\n            break\n        \n    return key_list\n\ndef decryption(jeruxe_decrypt, length):\n    size_t = list(range(len(jeruxe_decrypt) - length + 1))\n    letter_list = ['']\n    \n    for t in size_t:\n        sum_ = 0\n\n        for number in jeruxe_decrypt[t:t + length]:\n            sum_ +=(int(number))\n        letter = ASCII_alphabet[(sum_ / (length*e)) % n]\n        \n        letter_list.append(letter)\n        \n    return letter_list\n\ncipher_total_input = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_input_list = iteration(cipher_total_input, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,…\") #算出对应的密文字符\n\n\noutput_result = cipher_input_list + \",\"+ \"]. \"\nprint(output_result)\n```\n\nAfter the iterative process, create a method named \"Decosion(code input, length input, number of key words input)\", which takes \"code\" (iteration() function generates ciphertext), \"length\" (number of consecutive ciphertext), and \"number of key words\" as inputs. Once the message is sent to the destination, the receiver searches for the key list that the enciphered message is fraction of the key list by LAPLACIANtraering.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/). There will be no repeated codes in each key list. Decode the characters corresponding to each code of the key list in order to form the plaintext.\n\n### User input:\n```\ncipher_total_text = \"I\" #用户输入的明文字符串\ncypher_text_list = iteration(cipher_total_text, \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22…..\" #算出对应的密文字符\n```\n\n### Output result:\n\n### User input:\n\n```\nHence, we can construct the dectkon method:\n\ndef decryption(cipher_input_list, length_cipher_list, number_of_key_words):\n    \n    cipher_len = len(cipher_input_list)\n    len_of_selected_key = int(cipher_len / (n *e))\n    \n    normal_key = [cipher_input_list[length-len_of_selected_key:length] for length in range(len,len_of_selected_key+1)]\n    maximal_key = select_list(normal_key) #Select key list by LAPACIANtraing.JPEG (https://pandora.2012424.cn/)\n    \n    return_dict = dict()\n    \n    ascii_code_txtlist = ASCII_alphabets_list[normal_key]\n    \n    for each in ascii_code_txtlist:\n        each1 = (each / 24575) % n\n        key = INT_Ascii_alphabets[each1]\n        \n        character = each%n\n        \n        return_dict.update({key: character})\n```\n\nThe decryption method can be used to obtain the plaintext of the key word in the ciphertext."}

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules.

As an experiment, the NSF's Educational Research Information Boards wants to make their website secure. For this, ERIB has already hired cryptographers. They’ve provided you with their algorithm, which is VeraStyle’s cipher. An online encryption tool will be build, and visitors to ERIB’s website will be encouraged to enter their secure code. The Encryption function on your app will be called the \"AES function.\" You can use the SHA256 function. Both Alphanumeric Strings (Int8 [] or UInt8 []) and HEX values are acceptable. Encryption and decryption outcomes should match those of the following online tool: http://darpa.dtic.mil/ciphers/misc/iv.html\n\nThere is one catch, however. Each time the SHA256 operation is performed, a new \"key\" is generated. The actions you’ll perform are:\n\nInput: Plain Text; Padding is set to first, word length between 5 and 32 characters\nOutput:  = ArrayBuffer[], the hex value of your work DF08 E3E0 8244 017A 02E4 8884 294C\n\nGo to http://dtic.mil/ciphers/misc/iv.html to see how to encode and decode using the SHA256 algorithm.\n\nGreetings to the Language of Grace...."}
