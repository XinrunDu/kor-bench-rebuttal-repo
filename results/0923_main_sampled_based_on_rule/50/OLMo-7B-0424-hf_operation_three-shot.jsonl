Your boss asked you to attend a meeting for a grant proposal. Below is a part of his proposal. Could you, please, comment on if the data provided in this proposal are valid?\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThere may be values in either a sample or population that are extremely high or lower than the others. Observations that do not appear appropriate for the distribution of the data are known as outliers. Such observations can influence the results of a statistical analysis negatively. Outliers distort an average value and a variety of measures obtained from them in the sample.\nSometimes, they are the results of data entry errors, while in other cases it is reasonable or it is an intentional decision to eliminate extreme values in the analyzed feature. It may also be a protection mechanism to filter out bad data. In such cases, however, it is necessary to consider a reduced sample only.\nThis is true particularly in the context of experimental studies where it is very often necessary to remove outliers from the group of examined patients as this group tends towards the boundaries of deviance. In addition, observational datasets with no particular subject are often treated using some recommendations to validate the selected outliers through moderating and exploratory data analysis.\n\n**For this certificate problem, just give a complete comment on the proposal mentioned above:** (Please find below for background information on the topics)\n\n1. Is the proposed dataset valid?\n2. What techniques to remove outliers do the statistical experts in the grant proposal use?\n3.

The model was trained to predict congressional districts based on demographics (age, education, income, etc.) and policy behaviors such as the percentage of Republican and Democratic votes for control of Congress. The model was then out-of-sample \n for both in-state and out-of-state districts. This means the model was expected to be 100% accurate and Becker shows elsewhere that such prediction accuracy is achievable with some available data sets. He claims the model proved unrepentant about its shortcomings.
