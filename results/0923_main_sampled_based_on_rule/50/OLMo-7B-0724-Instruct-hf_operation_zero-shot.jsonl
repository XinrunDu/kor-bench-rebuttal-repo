Now, let's solve for X:   \n\n(X○5) = (X+3*5) × (X+5)).   \n\nTo find X, we need to eliminate the (X+5) terms in multiplication. First, let's think about the factors of 200.

So, X is [[[3 * (√6 - X /12) ]]] ."}

Since (6/X)*X is the minimum value of X·X, when (6/X)*X = 1, (6/X) ≤ (X/1), so we want (6/X) < X/1, which means X > 6/X is true when X ≠ 0, so we have (6/X) < X/6 holds when X ≠ 0, so X < 6/x.

The large number in this case is 10, and the two smaller factors are 2 and 5.\n10 = 2 × 5\nTherefore, \"10 § X = 2 × 5 × X\"\n\nNext, we simplify \"4 $ $ 2 = 8 ÷ 2\"\n4 $ 2 = 8\n\nNow we can substitute those expressions into the given equation:\n\"(2 × 5 × X) / (8 ÷ 2) = 5\"\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\"(2 × 5 × X = 40 / 4)\"\n\nSolve for X:\n\"5 × X = 10\"\n\nSince we know one of the numbers is at least 5, the other number must also be at least 5.

Let's calculate the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n](1+i)(−10+11i) = −10+11i−10i+11ii = −10+12i\n\nNow, let's calculate the left-hand side (5+X) × (1⊕X) = (5+X)(1+Xi) = (5+X)(1+X)(1−i+i^2)\n\nExpanding the rightmost brackets, we get: (5+X) × 1 = 5+X\n\nTherefore, we know that: 5+X = −10+12i\n\nNow, we want to isolate X:\n\n12i(5+X) = −10(5+X) + 12ix\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get: 12ix = −50 + 50i + 12xi, simplifying the right-hand side:\n\n12ix = 95ix, therefore, x = −11i\n\nSo, given the condition is:\n\n(2⊕3)×(1⊕−11i) = −10+11i\n\nNow, let's find (2⊕3):\n\n(2⊕3) = 3+2i = i\n\nNow, calculate the result of applying the problem condition:\n\ni × (1−11i) = i × 1 = i\n\nIt doesn't match the −10+11i expression.

This can be represented as:\n\n∫0π sin(x)dx　(definite integral of sine function).\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the exponential representation of sine function, i.e., sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/i. With this representation, we can rewrite the definite integral as:\n\n∫0π [ (e^{ix} - e^{-ix}) / i ]dx.\n\nNow, for simplicity, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫0π (e^{ix} / i) dx - ∫0π (e^{-ix} / i)dx.\n\nIntegrating each term, we get:\n\n[ (i/i) (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nSimplify the expressions:\n\n[1 (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\n1 - ((-1)/i) * (e^{(-πi)})\n\nWe now apply Euler's formula, which states that e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x). When x = π, we have e^(πi) = -1. So,\n\n-1 = (-1)/i * (-1) = 1/i * 1\n\nTherefore, 1/i = -1/i. When i = -i (imaginary unit), this simplifies to i*i = -1, which means\n\n-1^2 = 1\n\nSo, without using square root or another pianism to evaluate the term (1/i), we have the unique value of 1/i = -1/i = i^2 = -1, which derives from a complex connection. \n\nNow, we can substitute this back to the expression we obtained earlier:\n\n[1(cos(π) + i*sin(π))] - [(-1/i)(1 + i*0)]\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\n[1(−1 + i)] - [(−1)*(-1+0)]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n[1(−1 + i)] − [1(0 + 0i)]\n\nFinally,\n\n[−1 + i] = [−1 + i(0 + 1)] = [−1 + i]\n\nHere comes your result:\n\n[[−1+i]]\n\nBeing the result is not an integer, wrap it in double square brackets to display it as a number within the context, as you like:\n\n[−1+i]."}

Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nf□g=f'(x) \\quad +g'(x) \\quad.\n\n### Question:\nf(x)=tan(x), g(x)=x,find the value of f□g when x=π/4.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the value of f□g when x = π/4, we need to first calculate the derivatives of f(x) and g(x).\n\nf'(x) = sec^2(x) (using the chain rule for derivatives)\ng'(x) = 1 (using the power rule for derivatives)\n\nSubstituting x = π/4 into the expression f□g, we get:\n\nf□g = f'(π/4) + g'(π/4)\n= sec^2(π/4) + 1\n= 2 + 1\n= 3\n\nSo, the value of f□g when x = π/4 is [[3]], or 3 in plain english."}
