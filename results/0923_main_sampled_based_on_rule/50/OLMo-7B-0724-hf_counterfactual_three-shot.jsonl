Some even stopped taking action and instead began looking inward:\n\"I did a major mission and got almost thirty Pokémon I don’t have in my dex,\" someone wrote. \"Meloetta powers really do do wonders.\"\nOther photos uploaded to Twitter were of empty gyms, a place the player can build a team of six Pokémon and fight other players' teams of a similar size. These areas were filled with either Pikachu or Aggron, whose \"strength\" is questioned by some.\n\"Pikachu can't catch pokemon,\" a user wrote on Twitter. \"Are we gonna talk about how [...] Pikachu unfaithful, or the fact that pokemon is called catching pokemon, but aggron just takes them all up?\"\nSpecies like Aggron have evolved from earlier forms called \"Rockruff\". Rockruff can be converted to Aggron by feeding it Middle-Day [Potion], a restoration item in Pokémon Legends: Arceus that revives the fainted Pokémon. Other species have these stages as well, like Pikachu sucking up electricity into its tail, which eventually spin to create a pen of lightning.\n\"I guess becoming the Arceus is something special?\" another commenter wrote. “#ProtectTheAggronplanet because Pokemon is friggin' Great.\"\nAnother aspect of Pokémon gameplay is the player holding their Pokéball to create a blastbeam, which lets them catch Pokémon especially if they get their Amazing Ball X version, where the blastbeam is supercharged to shoot the cat's attack for knocking out rock cereal.\nBut many have already turned to “the third party\" rather than attempting to catch any Pokémon games.\n“I’ve literally turned off my...\"was it...low frequency...left, right, then I guess it evolved into notes in a circle where you can hit fire and maximize it, I don’t know,\" a player mentioned of Pokémon Go, its mobile version, in comparison to Pokémon Legends: Arceus. \"I’m sure I’ll go downhill soon, I haven’t been on it for like two months.\"\n#PokemonLegendsArceus pic.twitter.com/oAxigJ6jvi— Duggy (@duGyT)April 8, 2022\nOthers, meanwhile, glued themselves to the computer's inner workings rather than thinking about getting Pokémon and their fingers to their keyboards:\nA Sword player seen running around an empty af suit was still minding how their player's actions looked while simultaneously meditating:\nPokémon won't relent, telling takefulladvantageofthechinabounterrightaway because something something reach for physical something it doesn't move the way it should be moved.

Since reaching Harry, he has successfully bypassed the magic wards around Hogwarts, and the arrows were unable to stop him. When he finally arrived Harry had serious injuries, Hermione was severely poisoned, Ron and others were seriously injured. Except for the death caused by Voldemort (even if his heart was cut and locked in the mirror, Voldemort is, after all, a human being, with a body), Nagini was the only one who really faced the enemy. Harry has thought about several ways for Harry to defeat Voldemort, but none of them will actually hurt Voldemort. For example, after sealing Voldemort's heart in the mirror, and sealing Voldemort's soul in the cups, Harry did not actually kill Voldemort. In the end, he had to wait for Voldemort to possess Harry's body, so that Hogwarts could kill Voldemort. When Voldemort cast Avada Kedava at Harry, as long as Harry made the sacrifice of another person, he would die. This means that if Harry hired another witch or wizard to cast spells rather than sacrificing himself, Harry would have died of the magic spell cast by Nagini, so he would not be able to use Avada Kedava. However, in practice, different people will die under the spell, but all of them succeeded in countering Voldemort's spells. Harry would not know who this person was. However, Dumbledore took part in the round of Avada actually saved the person who cast it, it is this person who helped to get Riddle's diary into the Grim's hands to kill Tom Riddle. Who did this?

What is the result of this? (answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Archiving of data is completed或者Earth has entered the Sun's influence.##B. The nuclear power plant will not work anymore, and it cannot be replaced because the limited nuclear resources and raw materials will not work.\nC.The Nazis consider world domination scientifically feasible, and the greater the diversity of the race, the higher the probability of having a dominant type of race.##D. Researchers find out that characters are gathering, so they can only choose to hide or turn themselves in.\nIn order to survive, the Trisolarans must build a distant dwelling to remedy this situation. This choice can result in their destruction, allowing humanity to save the planet in an unknown way , helping humans gain a complete advantage over alien civilizations or preserving the game Three-Body iteration.\nThe researchers had failed to detect any alien forms of agriculture and development. As an example, the crystallization of objects, the wear and tear of biological life, the degradation and decay of inorganic matter, these processes would all be slowed, reversed, or even prevented completely by interstellar time dilation.\nThe culture of Earth had also seen such \"slow down time\" technologies. One such application was the use of mathematical probability analysis in games similar to poker . Another was the process of cryogenic suspended animation, wherein researchers evaluated the probability of recognizing and preserving ice age life. Only within the last hundred years had humanity pursued cryonic preservation as an active method of time travel.\nAn archetype is defined by its motifs. In \"Three-Body Problem,\" these motifs serve to \"walk the reader through the changes in the novel\" and provide \"an epistemic horizon across which shifts between particular and general modes of apprehension of the world may occur.\" By imposing expectations upon novel readers, archetypes allow space for familial relationships and cultural traditions to take shape in a variety of ways. In \"Death's End\", Ye Wenjie, a clone of the original scientist who discovers the Trisolarans in the Cold War, serves as an example of the matriarch archetype. Tichting as the child of scientist Wenjie, the clone DAF overcomes the generational differences and conflicts of the Cold War as a result of a shared value system.\nThe origins of Trisolarans in early 21st century China inspired the future historical narrative of the novel. Although the lives of characters like Ye Wenjie may have only lasted decades or even centuries, they serve as archetypes of humans living through centuries of change. The use of anthology material in the novel binds disparate stories together like a \"living chain.\"\nThe novel relies heavily on archetypes with cultural precursors, and archetypes may be likened to \"clotted carbons\" of thought, which Lam reflects on as she chooses her favorite archetypes from previous works. These archetype processors can be \"ancient ruses for reaching conclusions.\" To Lam, the last wise man in China struggles to \"dissolve \"the impasse of the dead or dying, \"whether in a single human way or in an aggregate mode.\"\nBy borrowing dominant archetypes from previous works, Lam blends both \"historical artifacts\" and narratives that require \"compromise, negotiation, conflict, and change\" to express her views on social and cultural crises during the 20th and 21st centuries.\nThe early sections of the novel are set in the early 21st century, but are continuously interrupted by a series of modified and homogeneous WWII. The imagery of WWII is reimagined in order to draw the narrative forward, and the narratives are used to \"reanimate the skeleton of our lives with a dreamlike device.\" Lam's narratives of World War II emulate archetypal plots. In constructing archetypes, Lam shows the readers the value patterns and values by illustrating and reinventing content and frames of mind from the original sources. \nThe novel engages in deconstructionist techniques. When building archetypal narratives, Lam reflects upon the decoding and reading processes, both of which serve as starting points for literary creation. Through highly subjective and personal views on the process, Lam reflects upon the use of osteological analysis as a term for the decoding process, and contrasts this with our bodily instincts to move until we are completely immobolized. Lethal disorders in the 20th century, which Lam believes to be crises of time, influenced her use of archetypal narratives for \"the perception of time.\"\n诐之海上有洞，有洞之遍了。久见老鱼是……##古 draws upon many archetypes from previous work, specifically 《老孽》中的\"灭亡\"，《残骸人》的故事中人心以赤眼看仙，而不是天助人之心. ##\"这是造物主，不是我了。\" ##信念的领衔是崩塌下的白花，魂不在所铭印……\nIt appears that the living undead rule over the dormant because they have fully dissipated their desire to stay alive, preferring to end themselves at the hands of the undead. The true power to change others is not power, but life - specifically living and becoming immortal."}

For example, Grizzlered Brown Parakeets are brown everywhere, regardless of what direction they are in.\nThose of multiple colors have a coating on their feathers so that they can fit into different colors of clothes.\nMew Indigo was the ugliest species of bird for many years until Mew Blue came to Earth with his own unique color scheme. Mew Yellow was ejected from Earth trying to escape through aircraft and Mew Green was not when the lands he lived on were destroyed.\nEarth's pigeons are pink, at first they don't have the same coloring everywhere, but only the upper body is pink. Eventually geese had many colors around the world, covering the continent of America, which spread the genetic sample to the native population to create other American species.\nDue to the radiation explosion escape, Tracray became a cross-spec wrinkled animal, experienced the extrusion of the seed, experienced the tumble of survival, the mutation of the chromosome, and three novel colorzones appeared.\nHumans traveled through to parts unknown of the Earth, such as GC12, the alien-driven asteroid, the GC15 virus is particularly deceptive. Mew Green flies toward GC15, her wings covered with several shades of blue to hide from GC15, while freshwater Red Sun Bonnet Geese on GC15 have red beaks and feet, but inside are covered with pale red hair.\nThe whale shark and Koenins traveled together until the Koenins destroyed whales.\nReproduction can be achieved in asexual mutation or in conjunction with external organisms; there is more sex-querling, and the chromosomes of one brood become part of the DNA of each parent.\nIn other parts of the world, blue whales may have been greenish and white, or overly pink. All kinds of strange animals came, those with power of gravity and regulations only inspired by legendary creatures, which we humans call Xinguang.\n\n### Question:\nHelena is one of the most dangerous places in the world, according to Mewskaters, with a lethal combination of quakes, volcanomes, aerosolized radioactives, andthe legendry monsters that spawn them. Helena is also the safest destination in the world for polar explorationrs, and is home to particularly hospitable wildlife, including the Mendocorny Anteater, the Ten-Gill Button Mollusk, and the world's largest egg-laying animal, the Bronse Wolf. ##What animal comprises its last name?##(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.

However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

I used to have (and still do) some, and my brother had them. If you have a clique in school, are you part of the problem or the solution? This article about school bullying really opened my eyes to the fact that cliques usually are the cause in someway or another. “Cliques seem to be the easiest way to get along socially, but they don’t promote diversity or creativity. Instead, they promote conformity. And incessant conformity eventually becomes an oppressive pressure for the de facto outcasts.” (Sodier) There are several ways I can think of to approach this problem. I recall an example where students were given a test to diagnose their level of conformity, and subsequently asked how much they would like to participate in the clique: most answered an...\nFrom my perspective, bullying is a form of social injustice and is most often perpetrated by the powerful to the powerless. In assignments such as the “Witness Statement” I’m able to empathize with the “powerless” or the victims, which aids me in understanding persons victimized by bullying. This understanding of others suffering is furthered in the article “Beyond Bullying,” where I learn how bullying is often covert and therefore aids me in the process of empathy. Bullying can result in victim having an increase in stomach pain, headaches, depressed feelings, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. This can lead to persons victimized by bullying to see bullying as a common everyday experience, rather than a disconnect from what is perceived as “normal” social interaction. However, I realize persons can take responsibility to stop bullying in their lives if they may be contributing to it or if someone they know is...\nThe world witnessed the crown be on thiroosed someone’s head to be called ‘The third Elizabeth Queen of England’ over the decade.

The parents were into marriage after Sildenafil the marriage had been highly disapproved by the Pope wanted a divorce from Catherine. This was due to the failure of her giving birth to a child leading up to the Sacramentalist Refusal to grant king Henry a divorce and annulment from his former marriage. Henry v had his biological children from Anne of Cleves. Therefore, I would have wanted to annul the curse she passed to her daughter that resulted to two men dying not long after their birth.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises.

These PSeBs are determined for a CLI model using the following procedure summarized in Total Tool . A CLI is defined as the union of a set of administrative regions (groups) and their adjacent protegesting subunits that permit travel originating from their own regions in addition to a subset of protected travel to their administrationculture neighbors. The protection limits a CLI group membership to protect the remaining regions. The CLI model considered here is a nested hierarchy of trusted and distant countries as well as inhabitants sharing a common origin (either the United Kingdom or Germany) with another country. The extended tree of clades serves to denote the countries (Table 1). The actual CLI model is depicted in Figure 2 and describes the countries that can safely receive shipments of passengers from originating locations subject to travel control measures. The risk of adulteration of the tree resulting from the selection of subgroup boundaries cannot hinder the utility of public health interventions and requires justified justification. For this sake, the probabilistic conclusions need to be redelineated by the authors of the CLI model because of the long-term distribution of the epidemic. Eccles (2014) utilizes Browser Tree (Ver. 3.14, University of Tennessee), a family of methods with multiple generations of parsimony (Vey, 1984; Everett, 2010) to extend single-time flight trees and / or subsequent land transmission clusters. The tree extension is obtained by first adding a virtual collection to the extent at points where the breakpoint is not allowed (negative branch). Trees are relapse blades at every point of division followed by a footnote from another group at the point of division. If the time-specific order of exposure to infected people initially infected at t2 is detected for at least two or all of the viral infections at t5 (1, 2, 3, 4), the minimum subdivision is shifted to the final handed recording delivered to the population population. The total chain of occurrence of infected people at t4 (12, 25, 34, 35), (24, 25) and (26, 27, 42, 43) is considered to indicate the presence of a more complex time (Figure 2). Annex 2 presents the CLI claws rules that document monotonic queries on infection paths. The following algorithm details (a topological graph for CLI),\n(a) Infected identity I (in adjacent combinatoric closures of a time exposed group (t3, t4)) is attached to the nested group composed of adjacent persons (t1, t2) thus indicating potential transmission of an infection through an infected person.\n(b) Supplementary group (excluding 14) is dissected by theme 14 for a shortcut through the exchange of 14 located at type 1; the (d) decomposed (13-14, 15-16) log follows.\n(c) Illustration is possible for the point of division of the grouping (ex 14) containing the group (one 'one '-sibase memorized group (t1) for whom another subgroup (t2) is inaccessible).\n\n## Conditional independence\nA disaster to read\n\n## Part of the Rules\nP(vi, vj | Ai, A2, …, An) = P(vi– 1, vjv1–1, A11, A2, …, An) P(vi | A11, Aj, An-1), (7.157)\nsubject to the condition that the entries of the covariance matrix (noninformative and non informative) are established.\nConditional independence marked\nviolates conditional independence.

The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Unfortunately, he couldn't join them during the initial development of the games he chose.\n\nA similar event has occurred in the streaming media business. Back in the early 1990s, a group of British actors and directors were working on a live action Final Fantasy adaptation. Since the team's face was actually on the screen, several people became interested, and Hot Toys started selling \"final fantasy products\", a quick-release line of action toys that featured iconic characters from the franchise's games.\nThe reception of \"thinking violence\", a cyberpunk action series, was mixed because of its dark and solemn narrative.\nHowever, through their actions, talents and the new media opportunities that the internet provides, \"final fantasy fans\" have really helped to disrupt the \"pop culture\" industry.\n\n### Episode 4\n\nFor reference\n\nA super-heroine called \"Hozuki\" strikes back at \"Powers talk!\",\"Aura: When the Real Girl Down Forth Slient\" and other world-class hot Anime come from Japan's TV.\n\nHuz-kichi come from a city in southern Japan, Tokyo-to(Tokyo) and love a big country.\n\n\"The information age is over.And the era of peaceful age begins.\"In the presentation lead by a rayman, the action hero relaunches.\n\nIn the original \"fairies different from the normal world\", a super-heroine introduced in Japan was looking for the perfect world"}

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival.

This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

For the revised Earth's common engine, universal electricity cars, the space elevator, the 3-body trajectory, Warp travel, electromagnetic windows, warp cars, wormholes, the Earth's third engine, U-3 engines, and antimatter technology, generally:\n1. The engine's name is derived from its functionality. In addition to aiming up to Arc Bridge, the space elevator significantly expands the load capacity of the sky bridge (elevator). The elevator employs a space elevator to go up and get transported across space. The transporter utilizes the U-3 engine to achieve \"3DWarp,\" also known as fast-drive space, when it takes spacecraft across space. Additionally, a wormhole is a communication technology capable of going through space.\n2. All 11 technologies mentioned in the Narrative are available to the public in the future.\n3. CHINA: In terms of raw materials, with the exception of Warp travel, the technology for the above ten items is expected to be realized in 2037 or later. The development of electric batteries on Earth is accelerating, and the cost of building an electric battery on the surface by the end of the year is expected to exceed $1 trillion. Fuel cell development in the United States and other countries is promising, with the cost of a comparable hydrogen fuel cell in 2030 expected to be US$150 per kilogram. New fusion power is the only alternative to increasing the power of nuclear fusion, empowering energy applications in the technique of fusion to reach 10 GW, exceeding terrestrial threshold grid construction.\n4. Europe: The space elevator has held spring spray events in London, Paris, Munich, and Berlin, where the project is well received, and the probability of moderate realization is high. United States: The United States has already built a rocket launch platform on the moon and planned the Moon International Space Station. Japan: A new design for the Ark International Space Station has been proposed, representing Japan's \"new denunciation of the New Geocentric Theory,\" urging the United Nations to take immediate action to evacuate the Earth under China's \"3DOwnload\" wave and move to the moon to evaluate the situation of constructing the exchange station. The UK: This year, the first stage of the bridge will open to passengers. The construction of the space elevator is expected to be completed in 2037. The United States: In 2037, the final phase of the Starlink II satellite network is expected to be put into operation, making global satellite broadband networks officially accessible. Russia: In response to the Global Internet ticking bomb issued by the United Nations, Russia has sent invoices to all countries for various plans for handover. Russia proposes to build the International Grid Count, with four space stations evenly positioned at 23.6 time zones, with each receiving two sets of bills every day, totaling 80 isotopes. The Starlink II satellite system consists of 12,000 satellites. In response to the energy crisis, the U.S. Department of Energy proposes incorporating fusion power into ordinary power transmission in a \"Self-Sufficient Rural Town\" smart tower project to support modern life. In addition to the space elevator, the United States has the strongest research on wormholes. In 2042, the United States completed the world's first quantum computer, with recent computing power of 50 TFlops, marking the start of its digital life research program. Brazil: Brazil took the initiative to propose the \"Bear Illumination\" measures, i.e., capturing the orbital magnetic field of the Bear Galaxy to amplify the magnetic field, thereby increasing the output power of the Earth's omnidirectional generator.\n5. North America: The current research and development of Warp Travel technology are Militaristic. The premise of Warp Travel is the ability to create refuelable accelerators, which can manipulate the surrounding ambient field to create a feeling of incessant acceleration. Warp Travel, when used with eigenvalues, can move at least ten times faster than the speed of light, making interstellar travel a reality. Even greater speeds are theoretically conceivable based on recent research findings.\n6. South Asia: The information about Warp technology on this website is for reference only.

Asia: In 2012, the Moon Exploration Project was approved by our national ethnic government. The first lunar lander mission has been conducted as scheduled. The manufacture of the lunar power-transmitting fusion “kite” starts in 2034; explicit financial policy support for building the Sacred Energy Lunar Entanglement—to power up a total of 40,000,000 solar power generation projects in the world. The House module concept foresees the house as a “room,” an undifferentiated space for work and living outdoors. An open-air house also retains a compartment for agricultural, silvicultural, silphological, and other practices. This prospective intelligent building combines a portable human settlement and a recessed \"green belt.\"\n8. Europe: In the face of the European Union's growing energy crisis, European nations and the United States agreed to start nuclear fusion power plants. In 2030, fusion projects will begin to break world records. Whether powered in part by a super reactor running at a high temperature, as the first nuclear fission-powered ITER project 20,000 times more powerful than France's comparable one in the early years of the project, the development of high-efficiency fuels, and the advancement of fuel reduction and reuse technologies in the fuel,"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

According to Sophie, to get clothes clean, leave it in a pan and splash them with cold water until they are not wet, and then wash it clean in a river. Sophie's mother learned this secret, felt proud that she had saved her family and survived the war, and finally died, peacefully crawling into her bed while someone was eating soup, swatting flies, and watching nights outside her window. Phyllis's son liked to climb trees and whistle a lot. While studying, he would whistle a unique melody, which not only cleared the audience's mind to absorb the essence of the next article, but also let them take away a warm meadow. She could hear a loud whistle from time to time while writing a book on how to break whites until she was overjoyed.\nPhylis washing off the stains on your body.Sophie's father's habit of beating but getting no reaction from them and understanding Sophie all her life made her more sympathetic than the others. When Sophie was at the turning point of her life, she did not want to listen to him or to the others because she didn't care about them. In her torn and dead life, If something troubles Sophie, she beats her black pillow and outlines the person who's having a bad journey sideways. She has learnt not to give up. At the peak of the embarrassment, there may be a glimpse of hope. Once upon a time, Sophie was asked to write an incident in her life that was unique to it and might influence her life decisions. It was no exception. When Sophie thought about it, she felt that, if she left her child to breed rabbits, she would regret it when she was old. Sophie has more than a desire to find a waste land, but more specifically, she hopes that the magic will achieve what she wants. It's like looking forward to a potential person.\n\n### Story Rule:\nThis is a world where magic exists, and, unlike other traditional fantasy worlds, modern magic was invented through the progress of human science. Human beings only use magic with their knowledge and talent, rather than invoking gods or demons and engaging in rituals to achieve magical effects. Some scientists have used very advanced machines, chemical processes, and maneuvered many parameters to accomplish impossible tasks required by magic: such as, with the use of a gigantic electromagnetic incinerator, they transformed a building into a magic candle.\nThe place is less than 2 kilometers to the west of the country. The town on the dead forest is hidden in the grass, and there is always a thick sound-absorbing barrier, under the radar, untraceable and inaccessible. A magician affiliated to Marshland created it. Large area with abundant raw materials, everything can be synthesized here, so setting up a workshop here is more convenient. People can't get through the sound-absorbing barrier and enter the city by themselves. The guardian here is also based on magnetic pressure, and can only be entered by moving things with magnetic power. As a magician, Sophie is quick to realize that her mission is to pass the test and exit this city. The magician must finish his or her work in two days without leaving the city. Apart from the magical effect of the city guard, no other supernatural disasters or records have ever been found in its vicinity.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a magician shop. When she was little, her magical power was so weak that it seemed that she would not be a good magician. She was considered lazy, showing little interest in her education, and always thinking about when she would be fine. At the age of sixteen, when she was the eldest of the family of magicians, her father disappeared. One day, when she was upset, her mother was killed. She was angry and became sloppy. Sophie was blamed by her stepmother and father, lost her sense of ethics, and became a rubbish. After becoming an adult, she worked alone outside, making a living. At the same time, she wanted to get rid of the past memories and identity, find a place where she was not measurable, so she tried to bid for the castle in the magical city, which was furnished with beautiful furniture. Sophie: Sophie: The request is Sophie has a girlish personality, she is observant and can grasp the most crucial links, but her family has repeatedly let her down. She always wronged people who love her and rarely loves anyone else, which makes her neighbour say that her inner world is like a bottomless oil barrel. The followers say she amazed them that she can find the exit in 24 hours. Sophie picked up a girl who had been attacked by goblins and inherited the spell. At the right time, she killed one person, and another turned back from paralysis. Her stepmother turned into a pile of ashes for a picnic while speaking. It was confused by the words the pupa said about cold wind, packed her clothes as it wished, and decided to step into thecentury long eaves.\nHer father returned to the country through the magic of others, but was attacked by a barbarian hero with a large army. Sophie at that time guided the soldiers to attack the heroes. However, she underestimated her father and felt that her father was selfish. The price he paid for his selfishness and dismissal of her father was the inheritance of goblins. Sophie left home with a sense of guilt and lost her sense of direction for a long time and came to the magical city. She saw the sign \"magician\", and was about to walk in.\nSophie suddenly heard a girl speaking from the door: \"Are you not ready for the exam?\" Sophie was completely nervous and retreated to stand in the back. Then, pretty eyes were fixed on each other, and the floor was rough after she walked back, with a face like crazy.\nMagiciansWar magicians People commonly known as: magicians. ##They use knowledge and techniques related to science to become magicians, including people of different professions, types, and years of study. ##Their basic technology is based on modern basic technology. However, because they rely on their own logic and various missing details, their understandings and innovations often diverge from what humans think is modern technology. ##They have access to a powerful magic system (called spell machine). The magic equipment in the system is integrated, which contains one or more magic spells with different names, programming sequences, or special effects. ## Like a Clash Royale deck (the battle card group also known as the deck), they can achieve magic in any way, as long as the magic in the battle is divided into different battle cards. ## Magicians can't use spells and magic equipment. It is necessary to create a magical space, or introduce the 12 elements of hair: metal, iron, stone, gold, fire, lightning, ice, acid, salt solution, water, magic oil, etc. These elements can be a private brain-washing transformation, or neurology. Into different types of magic equipment and accessories, for example, fire affects the temperature, lightning strikes, and when introducing water or salt, creating fairy-tale weapons that can tiedrop stuff. ##There are many magicians of the apprentice level, and there are not a few magicians of the expert level, and a few magicians of the magician level can exert many kinds of magical effects and abilities far beyond the ordinary, but even some magicians of the magician level do not have the ability to manipulate an element by direct introduction. ## For a certain amount of time (time according to different adventures), magicians are required to use magic or switch on a magic monitoring device on their body to play an identity test.\nPrince: A young man of bearded, bushy head. His face is convex in a very unhurried way, and he describes it as an expression of powerful force. He was accidentally turned into a scarecrow in a tantrum by the principal magician of the magic city and spent a few years (It is unclear whether the turnip-headed scarecrow is alive or dead, but they have a very similar nature. ## On the contrary, Howl"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist.

Within the woodland, a world of fantasy and wonders was reverberating, hiding from humans and ordinary travelers. For a time, Howl and the moving castle were safe here. On the way, they met Calcifer. It was like a fairy town and extremely mysterious. It had flowing rivers and lush grass: the exquisite isomorphism and kind souls of the forest moved Sophie deeply. When they went back to Howl's castle, Howl and Sophie quarreled a lot. Howl was reluctant to leave the castle to visit his lover. Sophie was angry with Howl and continued to stubbornly stay in the castle with Calcifer. However, when Howl suddenly discovered that he was shaking in the heat, he decided to leave and visit his lover. He left Sophie. Sophie felt terribly lonely in the castle and waited for a long time, but they never came back. Was Sophie thoroughly angry that they, in the beautiful castle, threw her out into the queue on this cold winter's Monday?\nWH-clause:\tHow Was Sophie Thrown out?\nOn what day, what time and what circumstances did Sophie get thrown out of the castle?!\nIt is not exactly clear if Sophie ever got thrown out or if she just fell asleep in the castle?\nThe story is about world war 1 and 2.\nThe question refers to the open vocabulary (OW) of a FACTOR related to the purpose of the story, knowledge of the characters who talk about their world and the storyteller.\nThe pictorial analysis questions (pAs) support learners in recognizing the originator of the text, making a pronunciation analysis, and in recognizing valid details (perhaps even changes of situation, state, or world) in the story.\nIn Sophie: The Magician, Howl, it is clear that Calcifer is a demon who speaks in rhyme. While Sophie and Howl show some friction at first, they both grow to respect each other's intentions. In Sophie: The Eternal Fire, Sophie's relationship with Madam Suliman is initially unhappy until she learns to trust in her. However, as Sophie reaches the castle, Howl's relationship with Markl is revealed time and again through à transformed relationship with her. Through her efforts, Sophie forms a relationship with the fire demon, with Howl, and later with the Witch of the Wastes. The last two considerations center around discernment.\n\n### Story Rule:\nEvery person in the world has a difficult relationship with their father.\nThis is a world where magic co-exists with science, set during the 4th century AD. Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer enter Childe Casterford where it seems like the town's people are surprised by their presence. Most of the villagers are calm when they arrive, but the visitors set spies visible with people looking at them. The young man at the front door of the royal palace seems visibly nervous when Howl visits. Most creatures and interesting places and figures in this book are mole people. The evil powerful magician has created a disaster area named the Wastelands where everyone is complicated up and throwing things at each other. Some locations in A Tale of Time City have particle effects on them. There is the chance that monsters are inside the building, so everybody checks for flying creatures before opening the door. As everyone walks down Duchess Road, Dorothy must stay nice in case Mapwhisker the bear is around. If it is likely that someone will sanctify your power, you should wait until you are stronger. When Babes the Bear's story has not yet been told, Madam Suliman mentions that evil spirits can consume a soul. After the fight, some of the wizards asked the burning cap, Why does fire not light the fire, then? There are two witches: One, who burns the wizard, and two, who burns the lands.\n\nThe story tells in first person from Howl's point of view, but the storyteller uses diegetic text to refer to the role of the narrator at various times as a teacher. The author is the storyteller in many places, defines new ways to think about things, and inserts “Offstage” speech tags in novel places. It is not entirely clear if Madam Suliman is the storyteller or the author. This is because at various times, in the course of the story, Madam Suliman is the authority figure for Crafts definitions such as poisons and wizards, whose purposes are strictly to be helpful to help students understand the scope of the story by accepting what the adult characters are doing and saying. The passages directly address the reader, like this:\n\n“Wizardy is something that is obtained through origin, via learning, or learning from a wit larger than yourself. Most experts make the second choice of learning from someone who is admired in the craft. Instead, I was promoted by being related to a powerful wizard, so I have no idea how much control I have over my powers.” The author also tells us: Nonmortal creatures talk to one another every day, but how do we know they are not using interpreters? To make sure we don't call people peasant farmers and cause trouble!\nThe author reminds us that “Chilo carmolies (keepers of the king's gravestones) often wore sunglasses with round wings (a term used by the howl magic), for solar tightrope stunts.”\n\nThe book shows us evidence of these at various points.\noption a. Howl, locus of (a) seemingly friendly relationships between humans and magical creatures, (b) possibility of conjuring magical effects on the rest of the world, or (c) discovery of magical or historically magical objects.\noption b. Pay attention to the castle and its functions and contents; these provide welcome clues. option c. Madam Suliman and the crew she manages are a clear sign that it is possible to achieve some form of rebirth. option d. Signs of a magical reality"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.

In his quest for peace and equality, Optimus Prime endeavors to take a altruistic and empathetic approach, opting for compromise and negotiation when possible. He believes that conflict and violence are not always necessary, and that a better future can be achieved through communion and cooperation. Unwilling to succumb to anger or manipulation, he disagrees with the tactical ideas of Megatron and yet they never splits, they shares the same goal.\nIn stark contrast to Optimus Prime's idealistic ideals, Megatron has nothing but contempt for cowardice and hypocrisy As the leader of the Decepticons, he views the world as a brutal and cruel force to be embraced and conquered. Megatron prescribes a militaristic and arrogant approach that emphasizes control and power, with strict hierarchies rooted in hierarchy. to Infiltrate Cybertronian society, Megatron consolidates his power over his followers, keeping them ignorant and underbosses and as such subordinate to the Autobots.\nThis different approach to governance, especially in terms of visionary leadership and flagship championing, reflected a crucialsplits battles keep occurring to transformers.

Optimus was drawn to the thinveilsg of a peaceful existence. Megatron hoped to fulfill his vision of creating a unitary Decepticon nation. He also begged him to kill the Prime Minister and marvel at the greater good policies.\nEventually Megatron and Optimus Prime met. Optimus Prime helped Megatron regain the First Prime, and they partnered during this time. Megatron introduced him to the Prime Minister, and Prime invited him to his dinner. Optimus Prime was pleased with what he saw. He thinks Megatron might actually want what he sees in him, and he's willing to let bygones be bygones.\nDuring a film called 'Age of Extinction', Megatron and Optimus Prime battled against each other.\n### Question:\n\nWhich films according to Wikipedia featured Optimus Prime?\nOptions: A.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King. It features icy plains, towering fortresses, and is the setting for the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion.\nPandaria, inspired by East Asian aesthetics, is a serene and beautiful land inhabited by the Pandaren and was introduced in the \"Mists of Pandaria\" expansion.\nThe Alliance, known for its principles of honor and justice, is composed of the Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and the enigmatic Pandaren. Each race has a distinct narrative that shapes its unique characteristics.Leaders in the Alliance are often chosen based on heritage, valor, or notable achievements rather than democratic elections. \nHumans, the most versatile of the races, hail from the kingdom of Stormwind and are known for their resilience and determination. The architecture of human cities, primarily consisting of medieval castles and fortifications. The Night Elves, one of the oldest races in Azeroth, have a deep affinity with nature and magic. The Moon Festival is an important event in the culture of the Night Elves, celebrating their connection to the moon and their ancestors. This festival reflects the Night Elves' tradition of reverence for spirits and ancestors. The industrious Dwarves and inventive Gnomes are recognized for their technological prowess, while the Draenei, refugees from the planet Draenor, are deeply spiritual with a strong connection to the Light. The Worgen are humans afflicted with a feral curse, and the Pandaren are a peaceful race that values harmony and balance.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the world's most notable creations?\nOptions: A.

They were also discovered in the mountain ranges of Eastern and Central Califor isn't built around mountainsnau, and in the Altai Mountains in Western and Central Russia; these species were also recorded in locations in Asia and Europe. Within the caribou genus, Cervus elaphus, there are in the wild today. In certain areas, some is now protected by law because of endangered size population. These are the mountain caribou and the Island Caribou. In total, the mountain caribou is native to five countries, an t is found in Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. In 1989, , Canada acquired 25 percent of the Northern Caribou Herd and sell skiing and movable assets in Violin County. hunting, shipping, and land sales intimidated large numbers of the island herds. The reason for their loss of sustainability has been indicated to be related to motor vehicle use by Canadians. They were either killed on accident, or mistook food given out by hunters for Drugs until after the snow melted. They usually wake during the spring, and go up to locations suitable for giving birth.

The Ontario government was not only against it, but used doe tags upon the month of July that year, to show the different population size of deer in the region, and three of these deer relocated to smaller areas with younger deer. The governments near the fauna are mostly worried about the alarming rate of hunting and environmental factors. Scientists believe that the northern caribou in Alberta are going to run out of food soon enough, which is important to biodiversity. -70km of mangroves and marsh make the most ideal a habitat for these creatures, and the area that is covered by these buildings lay at between 20 m to 30 m in elevation.\n.\nIn the second to last stages of metamorphosis, any Europeans living in NYC have anywhere yearly from 11 to 14 types. \nIn Russia, hunting of European badgers is widespread, but not recommended by the government.
