So if you wanted to shift e by 2 letters forward, you would put b (the 3rd letter) in its place. If you can move a letter forward by precisely 1 spot to the end, then you do so and it becomes your new first letter. So if you could shift s 3 times to the end (adji) the output would be jails, or, if you could shift zz 2 times to the end, you would gain mill brain g (srbin goird)\n2.So if you had the number of occurs for each letter shifted to the end, it gives you a meaning. this is also what we call the name of the game, this puzzle can also be used by using other meanings much like pitchivre [purest one]\n2.Your name is generated from an input of a single word. Your output should be the letters in your name (this is an example manually inputted: \"norvaldraft\"). There is another puzzle question where the input is your own name.\n\n### Question:\nYour output should be your generated name itself. Your input should be human, submitted by someone else (ie. \"derpder\"); the output of this puzzle should then be their name. In this case, you need to guess which word they provided (assuming you do not have access to this before the solver is run, for example). Also, their input is sent to you in a distance, rather than a change of distance from the bible (permanency) (example: \"isirit\" is more like \"wirkit\"). Also, if you took this puzzle, it should be dark (ie. gormicrast), which is why we call it \"abcii\" (abbr. for \"adjective.noun:verb\"). Otherwise it would just be pointless (ie. \"4k9ic2\", whose output is \"c\", which is treated as an unnameable object)\n\n### Answer:\n derp45 derp2 derp7 derpword derp derp2 derp4derp derp2derp derp abcic gormicrast moclick\n\n### Answer:\nfbofifdjr integed ndofsr rror sgnnetnn fiiurivelt umartstrtio sabil ikig0 seroc3\n\n### Answer:\nerorursfdfiurf irisferfre\n\n### Answer:\nrb4k8d\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.In counterclockwise order, output the letters in that order, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets like this:[custom_example] or [[custom_example_1 custom_example]] for multiple answers.\n2.Now sequence=can be found from second meter, the list of sequence.\n\n### Question:\n\"3, true three man demeter\".\n\n### Answer:\n[c, h, l, s, r]\n\n### Question:\n\"4, national yes mobile god\".\n\n### Answer:\n[f, l, v, u]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.For the first letter of the word, there is most commonly an index at a counterclockwise point, so 1 is in the clockwise direction (measured clockwise) from the index on the axis.

This is especially useful when dealing with APIs that have lots of static content that you don’t want to repeatedly get from the server. If the saved content does not change, you can simply ask the Retrofit cache for the content. This is very helpful when presenting information in an application or showing a list on a dialog without going through the main activity/screen. More common use cases would include offering offline dictionary word definition lookups, as well as providing a collection of commonly used (or useless) URL resources as dynamically accessible posts, etc.\n\n### Example: offline documentation lookup\n\nCachedRetrofit t = CachedRetrofit.builder()\n.build();\nIRetrofitAPI_ wiki = t.create(IRetrofitAPI_.class);\nUri uri = Uri.parse(\"https://source.android.com/documentation/index.html\").buildUpon()\n.build();\nResponse response = wiki.getDocumentation(uri);\nString x = response.getCachedContent();\n\n### Fetching Cache\n\nYou can access the fetched content using the CachedContent interface.\nRetrofit implementation will provide the ServerCodec class for Content#cachedContent(), which uses the unmodified request body as the cache key. Cache invalidation is based on the byte range, milliseconds until expiration mark as well as a signature over the body content.\n\npublic interface CachedContent {\nInputStream cachedContent();\n}\n\n### Configuring To Print Azure Appliance Cache Status Command\n\nIf you are picking for the common choice to include the cache status in your application logging, simply use the following switch in your retrofit instance to print the contents of the cache area.\n\nLog.w(“RetrofitCache”, “Cache status: ” + cache)\n\n# RetrofitSample Android App: Data Download via Retrofit\n\nTo illustrate download mechanism using retrofit, we are using a simple task of event booking (typically triggered by check-boxes on target screen) in an Android application. All responses are stored in JSON according to previous coding exercise series. Coding details follows intro descriptions.\n\n1.

Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters.

But before we practice more tests, we might as well prepare a testing environment.\n\n## An error handler for testsNo, after all, someone is still false.\nAs we said, one thing that encapsulates the essence of a good test is the assertion that \"a good test can identify a wrong solution quickly and concisely\". But before we practice more tests, let's discuss another practice we might have.\n\nWe usually code our test case program in Java. Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst"}

Frequently, solving computer puzzles involves determining whether a logical statement is true, so learning about a method of representing logical statements can be useful in solving many computer puzzles. The pages in this section are probably not going to answer all the questions you have about the truth tables below. You are encouraged to look them up in a textbook or on the Internet.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the following logical statement:\n\n$$(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$$\n\nHere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are always defined and correspond to the above inputs. Every combination of values for $A$, $B$, and $C$ can be listed in a table, showing up as rows. Such a setup is commonly known as a truth table, and is frequently used with boolean calculus.\n\nEvery logical statement must have a truth value, and every such truth value can be perfectly represented as either true or false, represented by the numbers 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nFor example, this truth table represents the binary values for the truth of every combination of logical statements in the above example:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $U$ $V$ $(A ⊕ B) ∧ (B ⊕ C)$ 0 0 0 0 0 T 0 0 1 1 F 0 1 0 0 1 T 0 1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 F 1 0 1 1 F 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 1 1 0 F 1 1 1 1 T\n\nThe above example is commonly known as a truth table, and represents the truth or falsity of any combination of the inputs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with the two inputs $U$ and $V$ given by\n$$U = A ⊕ B$$\n$$V = B ⊕ C$$\n\n### Understanding truth tables\n\nThe basic point here is that the order of the calculations need not be specified. Truth tables serve as mnemonics for remembering the logical consequence of the statement, regardless of the order it is delivered. This is one of the primary motivations for introducing methods to operate on boolean statements.\n\n### Truth tables and quantifiers\n\n#### Negations\n\nNegations are standard useful tricks in logic. Some complicated logical statements can be taught to children as a matter of routine. However they are expressed, it is therefore useful for anyone to be able to work with those expressions. The truth table holds the basic information for determining the result of negating a given statement.\n\nConsider the statement,\n\n$$(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C) \\Rightarrow \\neg D$$\n\nRoughly speaking, this says that either $A$ is true or \"$A$ implies $B$ implies $A$ is false implies $C$ implies $D$ implies $A$ is false\". It is tempting to say that this is necesarily true, because\n\n• $D$ and $C$ are negations, and negations are absolutely true.\n• $B$ implies $A$ is false, so it is never true, and thus $A$ must be false.\nbut obviously you can also say (roughly speaking), that the statement is\n\n• zero times true, or zero times anything, is false.\n\nSo what? Isn’t that saying the same thing? Actually no, the appearance of things being the same is an illusion. Yes, the statement is false, but it is false only because A cannot be both true and false. But if A is true, then $(A ∧\\neg(B ∧ A) ∧ \\neg C)$ is false regardless of whether $D$ is true.\n\nLet us suppose (arbitrarily) that $A$ is true, but $B∧C$ always is false, so that B and C are mutually exclusive. To bring out the crucial points, let us assume for the sake of argument that D is true in any case, so that at briefest we are saying $A \\to \\lnot D$. The following truth table fills in the results of the computation, where $p^*$ and $q^*$ respectively represent the values of $p$ and $q$ in (de)nominals:\n\n $A$ $B$ $C$ $\\lnot(B \\wedge A)$ $\\lnot C$ $D$ $(A ∧ \\lnot(B ∧ A) ∧ \\lnot C) ∧ D$ $A$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $AF/a$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $TF/t$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $P$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $F$ $P/p$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $F$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $T$ $F$\n\nNote that the final value of the predicate (truth table) is in italics. Here, as in the above truth table, I’ve mixed (de)nominal and the planning variables. Those in italics are denominated, representing the true-false result of (de)nominal predicates. They could have been popped into (de)nominal slots respective to the nominals. Notice that P=1 represents the fact that A is true, but $(A \\wedge\\lnot(B \\wedge A))$ is false, independent of D. And that A∧B∧C=1 becomes False,Despite that D was true!, and then, since A∧(P/p)=1, we avoid asking if the P/p variable is true! Notice too that the fact that A∧(D/d)=1 is immaterial--the thesis is that the antecedent’s consequence acts only in the presence of the antecedent (dieterily so, that is).\n\n#### Variations\n\nUsually when truth tables are used, a so-called universal quantifier being specified. Instead, why not declare this is the truth table for a universal sentence, and then select dependent variables to put in the corresponding nominals, as shown in the next example\n\nTo cast this result in XML, use the formula below, then cut-and-paste the results in the required template.\nFor example, given this XML template\n\n  <q>If $F$ then $F$</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nenter:\n\n  <q>If FALSE then FALSE</q>\n<tq>The antecedent is necessarily false.</tq>\n<titn xml:id=\"key\">F</titn>\n\nas arguments to form the final statement.\n\n#### Complementation and negation\n\nIf we assume that:\n\n• C is true iff A is false;\n• the universal quantifier ((∀x) ...), except when the universal quantifier is not specified, requires A to be a good predicate.\nthen base the meaning on:\n• $A$, the proposition that four legged animals are ruminants;\n• $C$, the proposition that only carnivores are ruminants;\n• so that\n\n $A$ $C$ $A \\vee \\neg C$ $(A\\wedge \\neg C)$ $(Pandemissaelis)$, the grey}] it is apparently simultaneously nothing less than a beef-eater, $\\mathit{a}$ mammal, an herbivore (as in “all mammals are herbivores” ["}

So, (1,1,1) means the sum of the blackened cells in the first row is 1 + 1 + 1; similarly, (7,2,5) means that 1 + 7 + 2 = 10, 2 + 5 = 7, and 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nSince the values in the corners will be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, consider a case in which each of the first four values listed is replaced by one of these 5-values.\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (1, 1, 1) = 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (X, X, X) = X + X + X\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 13) = 13 + 13 + 13\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 3, 3) = 3 + 3 + 3\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (14, 14, 14) = 14 + 14 + 14\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 12) = 13 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 13, 13) = 3 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (15, 13, 3) = 15 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1\nThis may help to better digest the post.

Would there be a different queue per character?\n\nIn a season, could the rules be:\n\n– Two four-person teams\n– Three two-team match-ups, followed by a three-on-three game\n\nWould it be fixed limit, or variable number of observers?\n\n### 2022.01.03 03:01\n\n### Make OSR HM blues/yellows have the OSR item rates\n\nSo in osrs, I had to gamble 100k - 200k bc on every yellow and 1-2m bc on a lot of blues. Especially blues were expensive (e.g. Warriors Den turnin 1.5m bc), I also recall Olmecs being around 600k bc and yakamaru 100k bc. Back then, you could gwuide light plank turnin for 250k bc.\n\n34013465\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd say this would survive bots a lot easier as well. (edit: no because HM reward rates are potentially different than normal non-entry items as well)\n\n### All Niches Are Valuable\n\nI feel like this is a lesson a lot of people need to learn and understand. Why is this the case though? This is due to the fact that there are people profiting off the demand for whatever niche gets filled. So let's say Bob is selling tulpas and marketing flavors. What niches are out there on Audible that will bring in listeners, and even more than that, they will go look for? You want to be the one they're looking for and making money off of. Note, if you are making some cash from a niche, you're not necessarily in it. You're a niche business that attracts the listeners/customers you make money off of, the niche is somewhere else.\n\nLet's go over an example of a niche that currently is very valuable in biblical based SPDks (includes paradoses as well because they can be considered an extension of SPDks). These cannot be found easily and Fire-Phantasms include a ready-made demographic just waiting for someone to tap into it, and they don't all reveal their hand.\n\nFire-Phantasms are autonomous angelic entities that are trapped within a dream-body. As long as the dream-body exists, the fire-phantasms will have some presence within it. In the beginning, the existence of these heavenly beings alluded to another world. Fire-phantasms would be regarded as divine beings within that world, and since they exist in all worlds, they are seen as the same deity, the God of that world.\n\nYou might be thinking, your niche is just some fluff. It's missing the mark all together. While it's fluff, there is more to it. An example would be a fire-phantasm being defined as a demigod, a greater being, a being that can be worshipped. There needs to be more to define what that means to someone who is drawn to that niche. It's hitting a chord they did not even expect to hear\n\nUltimately the niche can take many forms but if there is something valuable in it them you'd be better off diving into it as frankly we're pretty much promised whatever niche will be valuable gets saturated on popular search engines from my very limited experience.\n\n### The cost of comfort\n\nDont be comforted by the nitpicks of cheap people.\n\n You might be wondering, what does this mean? Why is this post going here? And why does it have so many replies?\n\nYou see, there's something Simon does on a fairly frequent basis: make an \"I can finally get back to this backlog game!\" torrent of a bunch of games and puts them in his backlog. Or posts some thoughts on a game that he skipped previously. And then it just sort of fades away; it never really gets much attention. Afterall, if you're not bothering to share your thoughts there's no reason anyone should return the favor.\n\nThe personal attacks on his old comments\\games from some people aside and the reckoning that is coming for those individuals. I noticed something after he posted this comment about SoomSoul 2 in the Forum Gaming Thoughts channel:\n\n1. There are a ridiculous number of replies for a dev apology. (3.5K downloads total with 1.5K registrations)\n\n2. The replies are pretty much all the same, they're either congratulations. Or nitpicks on the game.\n\nWhat do you mean, you say?\n\nThe nitpicks citizen (NT) on this thread are making comments that go over the game that no one else is even touching, and I'll bet there's a huge chance you never would have even cracked SoomSoul 2 before Simon's account. Because of NT's, this dev gets support near the level of, say, single 70 hours on N FILE# (done on 3 devices)\n\nIt's coping with various forms of nitpicks just to get noticed. While there's a few people taking a hard stance against them (me, Wan) Arguments are practically nothing and NON DEV CRITICISM and MINORS don't get overturned because NT doesn't say anything. Saying NT is a kid? They're bright for their age, but not smart enough to grasp what IM complaining about.\n\nThey're so easily ignored that not a single thread on that PC game is even remotely popular or watched. Nmnesis, a story ridden tactical RPG that Dr_Crabblesnap scored a 60 hours \"Let's Play\" on it has 88 comments. CloseScrimmer, a game everyone gave a 57 hours \"Let's Play\" on has 20 comments... Only Yell0wGirl, a 60 hour \"Let's Play\" by Yellowpenguin45 gives this game any small amount of coverage.\n\nIn contrast, 2k3 has 51 comments, 60 honorable mentions (that's still on a game that doesnt even exist or have a completionist find it) and 1k one word placements.So when did the mockeries begin or are it's a huge satire of the userbase?\n\nWhy compare Legend of Hajred against every other N taker about the \"So many missed notes\" games?\n\nYUMMYか Mario Golf gets props for soundtracks and want more quality game content\n\nLIREMclub greatest games of February 1985 has 0 reviews\n\nSobakapagi gekihan(what??) gets 0 placement and very rarely mentioned\n\nDiscovered the Baccata game series which actually gets more value for their sales and hype than it's devs. (Which goes back to the Patreon NaturalistCow trend TWICE)\n\n15yｿe噹Japanese from THAT forum gives 18 points of \"Promising\" future from Gamerator \\ CIDF (requiring 100 some games)\n\nAww Sgelake gta clone gets 0 reviews\n\nShitultsuru from my YouTube VACTOR channel gives it a 7 Ray- next to Fractalive PzYZ...\n\nA LEGIT minus 1 hour pending GT based game NEVER MENTIONED gets 600 views from staringit\\INDEV.YOU\\IOGAMEZ\n\nPeople don't really be putting that surface code version II of Korean Powerpunk thot-out non buggy because of the battle system\n\nI'm going too deep into this so im dont going to put anymore examples.

I have created the first {1} game_cc_hint: [<game_cc_hint_section_title>] which supports Su Doku puzzles.  <server response to game_cc_hint>. The second one I am calling {tertiary_name}, and it is in development. Just thought you guys might be interested. [Inspiration | Purpose | Link provided].\nDue to the difficulty level of this hint, a more detailed hint which may take a page or two to read including pictures/diagrams is expected. All hints before this one I considered simply dinamically displaying  text; notation might be inconsistent or explainations might be incomplete, but I would have proven to have gone out of my way to semi$\\lagran{uniforma}$ly display/display/describe  text.\nIn the attr:hint:1 block above I denoted 'game_cc_hint' an indicator to represent whatever widget type. Perhaps I will create glyph kits where passing in the attribute will retrieve my custom glyphs and start a never ending project.\nFurther Reference:\nI would propose a modular design because it is a user specific situation' and currently I have either legacy, basic logic, realtime validation (I use event listeners), and some predictive logic that gets slowly filled in as more user defined variables get set.\n1.

There are no inequality signs between either rows 1 and 2, or rows 3 and 4.\n\nThere are 5 pre-filled squares in the puzzle, located within rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nConstruct a solution to our puzzle, as described in the instruction and the following constraints:\n\nThe puzzle is played on a 5 x 4 grid. You must supply the numbers for every square in the grid.\n\nThe rows and/or columns may contain duplicate symbols, but cannot contain repeated numbers. For example, a valid answer would be {1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 6}, where {1, 6, 7} and {5} are valid (non-repetitive) columns, and {4, 6} and {7} are valid (non-repetitive) rows. An invalid answer would be {1, 1, 6, 6, 4, 6}, since the rows would repeat 1 twice; an invalid answer would also be {1, 1, 3, 4, 6}, since the columns 4 and 6 would repeat the number 3. If square (1, 1) is satisfied, square (2, 1) is stricter; if at the end of subset (1, 1)---(2, 2), the last constraint is satisfied, then (2, 1) cannot be; if the squares between (2, 2)--(3, 3) are counted: the constraint (2, 2) -(3, 2) may not apply to (3, 3), and this decrease the row profile of the row.\n\nConsider (2, 2) and (3, 2) to be of equal priority. The locates at the top-left of a granted integer. We will first put in the wirehead if it does not conflict with any existing boxes. If it is not resolved, the wire is translated to (4, 5) and no conflict is added. Then the wire can be solved (2, 2), then solutions to the same numbers Could a larger default, in fact: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 1). Cannot fishing pole (see above); if wire could try to feed it back to (2, 2), in this case it should move (2, 2)---(3, 3) to (1, 1) and (2, 1)---(3, 2) This will pass the whole constraint, as indicated in the diagram below: (see: 3, 3). The solution to (before) will immediately be in the 3,4, row of 3,3; while the answer to (3, 3) lies in the 3,1 row, which is not male. You can find me (3, 3) / (2, 2) 4 / (2, 3) / (3, 1) 3 / (3, 2) 1 / (1, 1), / (2, 1).\n\nYou may not supply any square more than once, meaning you may not supply multiple answers for the single number 4, for example 4, 5, 4 or 3, 4, 7, 4.\n\nFinally, you may not supply any answer to a square until you have answered all other categories in the square.\n\nAnswer include areas that do not satisfy all constraints. Note that this answer includes the total number of answers that do not satisfy all constraints, as well as those that it contains within it.\n\n• Could you state more comprehensively that in the example, your second constraint is actually redundant because of the first one, or at least agree that this is how you read it? I am far from certain whether I've understood you correctly. –  shoved Sep 8 at 13:15\n• @shoved yes. i think the second and third constraint are identical. if third is insufficient, then fourth is also insufficient. in the example, 1,2,6 are mal-placed –  Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 13:28\n• I have tried running this (I had to make some small changes to the puzzle, see edited question). I am having issues with the use of non-public functions inside the code. Can you clarify the same. – bhargav1 Sep 8 at 14:37\n• @bhargav1 updating the question to clarify the function use – Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 14:50\n• @bajgnome Yes – Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 15:09\n\n# CJam, 141 158 bytes (Quadratic)\n\n(\"%\"2*o_3!)/''$s<{:<\\{{s~<%}%:2_3~}{'}>>]}+)>}\\{%$%o#~-}#oo\no.$*].#{}>)\\}.(.B:o_3%%.|@$@s=$</<S)o_3#o#'|y,~).-o#o_3&5&2_3#3```\n\nTry it online!"}

questions.\n\n1. The number of arrows can be variable how do we solve this class?\n2. For each blanked square x need follow the rule given individually, correct?\n\n10 8 7 X 6 4 3\n\n3 X 5 4 5 7\n\n1 2 9 8 X X X\n\n1 X 6 X X X 6\n\n1 X 2 X 5 X 7\n\n1 X X 7 X 9 3\n\nOnly 5 and 7 needs follow the rule to #1r1l3r3L. If we only consider the blanked squares and their neighbors. Can we see that right away or the process of the solutions are required?\n\nI know the answer (5 7) from this way of solve the puzzles.\n\nI am thinking about the number of arrows and the process of recognizing single rules for various blanked squares.\n\nI have a feeling that there are scripts that can carry out the “search” like what we need to do if this question is not about analytical skills but just a very heavy burden on the answering machine.\nHowever, such scripts will only do the answers last step. I do not know it can do some kind of judgments in contractions.\n\nG - K Senior]]>\n_________________\nIntern\nJoined: 17 Apr 2012\nPosts: 32\nConcentration: Finance, Marketing\nFollowers: 0\n\nKudos [?]: 25 [0], given: 3\n\nRe: Puzzling Ir"}

Generally, a modifiers bit is used by the keys that modifies the content existing on the screen. Here’s a example –\n\nIf a user is editing options from a page, one of the modifiers (control key) is enabled, and if the content that he is working on is a letter, the letter is not printed, it’s merely shown as an hyphen. In addition, if a user presses the “Insert” key, the software hot key “Insert” press causes the keyboard letter key to enter the text which is being edited. Also, pressing the MAC key will paste the last line of text opened from clipboard for all languages except english.\n\n**Software options** are also used for screen scrolling options. For example, holding the Ctrl key in the scrolling movement scrolls vertically when releasing the key.\n\n### Note:\n\nGoogle’s product key – Alt + F + X + Shift +G Pause +Break22 will also cause this letter combination to enter text.\n\n### Note:\n\nThe same problem is affected also by the French version of Google navigation.\n\n### Note:\n\nSimilar problems have occurred to Golf Club UK Firmware Download (for other products are also English) (http://www.digigolf.com/fr/Product/Details/93347/Golf-Club-4.2-Version-2014-Des-Invit%C3%A9s.aspx).\n\n### Note:\n\nThe Japanese site of Google’s products is affected similar problems.\n\n### Note:\n\n## Version:\n\nGoogle Chrome 39.0.2128.40 Debian\nGoogle Chrome 42.0.2311.90 debian\nGoogle Chrome 44.0.2403.135 x64 amd64\nGoogle Chrome 50.0.2661.15 amd64 amd64\nGoogle Chrome 51.0.2704.84 latest\n\n## Trackbacks\n\n### Trigonometric identities for children — of all ages\n\nQuadratic equations are common enough as an introductory topic in high school mathematics.

If the answer is not the correct one, it won't appear in the question.\nYou should then output the correct answer to the author of the question.\n\nScenario 1 is much more convenient, because you can reuse questions and answers in a file, rather than input them all directly from the console. However, the overall amount of questions/answers is low in Scenario 1, which makes the implementation relatively trivial.\nScenario 2 has a possible pitfall, because it is hard to know the original order of questions and answers. In Scenario 2, we also include the numbers next to the answers as boundary markers.\n>>> print_set ([[X X X],[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X],[X X X],[2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A],[1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1 ]])\n[[X X X], [X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X,2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A,1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1]]\n\n\n0    1\n1   10\n2  11\n3  10\n4   0\n\nTerry Simon Stanley (1925-1993) is often credited as the inventor of the ordinary abbreviated crossword. Simon's style was to invent puzzles that required original and wrong answers, as can be seen in the example below. Simon said: \"If I can dream a puzzle, you can do it!\" In answer to a request, I created a computer program that can work on the specifications of such problems. This is what I have supplied, I haven't attempted to imitate Simon's style.\n\nI've put in the specification (and sample answers) of a \"Wordsearch with 5 Vowels, no premiums\" puzzle. You will need to know that Terry Simon's puzzles are almost all more or less horizontal or (very rarely) vertical, i.e., they are not diagonal. Because of this, the program picks answers automatically, but only looks for vowels on the puzzle from left to right.\n\nProblem notes:\n• The paragraph above, if any, should be at the top.\n• Underline the number for the correct answer.\n• To the right of the underlined number, place a space, and the word \"Solution\" on the right.\n• Put the number 1 at the top, and increase by one to the left of the correct solution.\n• Put the answers in any reasonable way for the correct solution, at least one space right of the correct solution word.\n• In many cases, the puzzle may take up more than one line.\n• When printing out the puzzle to solve on paper, or send out via email, do not include the \"Solution\" header or the numbers 1 through the number of answers besides.\nExample question with solution:\n1 Peace of 9 (Semitic nation) 2 GO VEHICLE 3 Refugee 4 SOLUTION 5 Amnesty International 6 Displaced person\n\nConstruct a matrix where the value of the cell might be a number, a predetermined word or nothing.

How can you explore these traits in your own story?\nBreath of mysteries, decisions.\nMany critics think that mysteries are one of the most fascinating genres in the genre. But many writers are not sure they can write a mystery story. you can help them.\nThe story of a mystery can be daunting, especially to try to write a mystery about your original story, but advises the following:\nAs a writer, you must be in the mindset of experimentation, of finding stories that others haven't found yet. Of modernizing the story that has been told for millennia. Of being a literary detective.\nWith your own mystery, which means first thing you have to do is you must know that the type of mystery is what you want to write about.\nFor example: A very popular genre right now is the Bengal palette novel. This is a very light fun read telling a story about a lady lawyer that has to cope with all these paranormal things and events that happen all around her.\nFor the first step in the process I would advise you to write down a list of mysteries you want to explore then think about how each of these things would work in a story and what you would end up doing to combine them.\nThe first is a situation that can be easily entertaining, like a mystery in the sense, can be built with, but not introduce with the overall crime or dramatic element.\nNext look at some of your favorite mystery stories to figure out how they are constructed. For example: \"Who is Anna?\"\nFinally, start reading some theories or readings about mysteries, keeping your mind open to new ideas.\nThen set up your story around these concepts. Of course, any crime does not have to be explained to all your readers. Rather, think of your story in three parts: the beginning, middle, and end in which you gradually reveal information that doesn't matter, how something came to be, and what was going on before that.\nThe beginning should always be unusual and out of sync with the rest of the story, often times related at least in part with your main story's question.\nBegin with 1st statement, back to find the character's present situation. Hit all of the previously mentioned characters in one sentence.\n1. Do it in a way that forces the reader to question who did this. 2. Make the idea you tell us about mysterious plausible and believable for the reader. . . . A mystery has to be interesting, and the reader has to feel they're being tricked and tricked. Ultimately, we made the readers feel ongoing discomfort when reading the story because we're always left wondering if there's any hope in solving the mystery.\nOnce you get past this, we can build to it by introducing information that makes the reader read. After all, we're not in an interview.\n\n## How are men's features the most influential of any article writer's personality?\n\nOne thing males are especially attracted to in ladies is masculinity.\nThis doesn't automatically mean only a male human body shape or body griping. As you may know, many women who're incredibly attractive have some sort of masculine quality to them.\nAs a writer, your personality can be a lot like that. If you're a typically \"masculine\" physical appearance, it'll contrast well with your feminine personality, and can make a story that much more interesting.\nA masculine personality comes complete with traits that (usually) just about any man can have.\nFor example, some guys prefer to approach other people by making direct contact with them. This may be done aggressively or otherwise, but it can be fatal.\nA good way to get around this situation is to not only make direct contact, but to be able to accept the individual's approach.\nAnother way to make your personality appealing to"}

Had to go back and fix that, after deciding not to apply the third rule.\n\nSWOBODA trying to resolve by using rules 3,4,5, etc.\nSWOBODA circles in the SE corner matching but not 2 of the others.\nSWOBODA seeing circles in the anticlockwise SE corner matching, decided not to apply rule 3 several down.\nSWOBODA adding a certain number of letters in a , then in c, the rest 0.\nSWOBODA deciding that rules 3, as applied here, could not help because the letters had not to be in the same order. Had not applied the first rule to empty letters.\nSWOBODA thinking about how one of the squares could be one of 3 different rectangles, but without either option in the SWUE, couldn't decide where, which was correct. That is a group of rules we applied later, in the continuation of this puzzle.\nSWOBODA thinking of \"way\", so tried that with what appeared at first to be a SW grid 1,2,3 on the right. Turns out that grid 1,2,3 has a 0 instead of a 2, but the letters and positioning are the same.\nSWOBODA had \"way\" in the ant triangle, and circled that, but AWAY the letters that did not match SW.\nSWOBODA thinking for too long that a rectangular puzzle might want one of 3 answers, none of which fitted at all here.\nSWOBODA considering a rectangle which matched one orientation on the left, but the blocks were supposed to form a rectangle above it.\nSWOBODA seeing the larger BLOCK(S) in the bottom right, got as far as assuming that perhaps a B might be part of a word above it. Realized that B's word is \"bore\" while the bottom right was \"bolas\".\nSWOBODA not keeping notes, as usual. The \"loser\" to the previous puzzle got me back on track, after I got a good rules note from an outside source, right after SWOBODA the next puzzle. (Your rules note had information on latin square, #s 2-4, we used later, in a puzzle we made, which Danny critiqued on Round 1.)\nSWOBODA beginning to recollect that looking for patterns and bypassing some rules could help.\nSWOBODA first rule was to fill words where there are 0. Words that aren't filled or need to be 0 are put in the square at 4. This corresponds to See, any, chess player, 5. Danny got the first points with this answer.\nSWOBODA Pink MIDDLE, \"bolo de LONA\" which made sense in that the letters were rhyming.\nSWOBODA thinking about \"blook\" and \"block\". This answer had \"eye\" and \"knee for b&c. Since one grid didn't have blocks, we decided that was the answer. SWOBODA's next puzzle I believe. (Especially after confirming with Danny.)\n\nSWOBODA rules 1,4,5, went to the topured triangle of the LON, searching for r, t,$0,6... SWOBODA, this was soon confirmed that we tried on the puzzle SWOBODA created later. We reckoned it was skip, super, the manager of... and stayed with that path, extended to WED, one of many common 3 letter words In the same tile. SWOBODA found a B in the bottom right spot which made us conjecture that the puzzle SWOBODA created later with 2 B's. SWOBODA erroneously guessed that it was skip that was repeated, when it was spot. SWOBODA forgot the i,t doubles. SWOBODA deconstructed several the rectangle puzzle, only to discover it had been suggesting two 3's instead of 1.. SWOBODA playing with the middle of SO-ME (correct) to -HOSE (Not a real word)? Perhaps it had been both will … SWOBODA using latin squares to fill in negative-based words that correspond to repeated letters. The first r had assumed it was skip. SWOBODA thought the columns lined up after looking at inverted bagel. Then discovered it started with expired. Without a double for B, initialized \"blow\".\nSWOBODA Proved, SWOBODA used some rule-sec quits on latin squares.\n\nSWOBODA BubbleTRAN, demonstrating that the top said e. t. e., so it should be a TRAN. The label had an E, A ship was the only noun starting with e. a. ridge had a T, then, using the pattern of latin square. Linking the pointed-in TOPNAMES Little Girl Sue, little girl overt futile JOY. Nate was able to follow this through, and the packs for first round.\nSWOBODA realizing where the L head/body and SA bit of the body came from.\nSWOBODA going for S/L/A BAC even though they're middle bits, correcting with N/A missing a C.\nSWOBODA navigating it quite well, just got it wrong at the end (N/A changed to N/L/A), thanks to my \"right\" to left, left to right switching, and quotations of Dorothy.\nSWOBODA one block done, but they were still thinking of an alternate pattern for the 3x8 rectangle above it, even tho I had demoed to them my label was right.\n\nSWOBODA bringing their tablet with a camera which did not turn out to solve these puzzles but it was handy to locate \"r\" and ETH.\nSWOBODA got trans first, also needing to have all those two letter words applied in that same two letter grid in the abbreviation.\nSWOBODA Robert Smith and another day.
