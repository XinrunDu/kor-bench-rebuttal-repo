Using rules of inference and basic logical equivalences, we can simplify !(!p & !q) & !r as (p | q) & !r, and !p | (!q & !r) as !p | !q & !r (by applying the associativity of '&' in conjunction with '|').\n\nUpon examining these two expressions, we notice that they are not equivalent. The expression (p | q) & !r combines p and q using '|', while the second expression does not. Thus, the first equivalence is not valid.\n\n(2) The proposition (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r is equivalent to !!(p | q) | !r by applying the equivalence (15), and p\u21d1(q\u21d1r) is equivalent to p | (!q | !r) by applying the equivalence (15).\n\nAgain, we see that we need to check if these two expressions are equivalent. Using rules of inference and basic logical equivalences, we can simplify !! (p | q) | !r to (p | q) | !r (since '!!A ::=:: A'), and p | (!q | !r) can be left as it is. By comparing the two expressions, we see that they are not equivalent. In this case, for the second equivalence, the distribution of '|' over '&' is not included as a basic equivalence rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer for each sub-question is:\n\n[[B];[B]]\n\nBoth of the given logical equivalences are not valid."}

After initializing, S0 and S1 are empty sets, while S2 is also an empty set: [{};{};\u2205]\n2. Before addressing the clauses in S1, we need to break down the given boolean expression into simple disjunctive clauses:\n   - (\u00acp \u2228 q) represents clause C1\n   - (p \u2228 q) represents clause C2\n   - (q) represents clause C3\n3. Now we solve for S1: {(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)} and S0 remains empty: [{};{(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)};\u2205]\n4. During the resolve operation, clauses (\u00acp \u2228 q) and (p \u2228 q) should be resolved to obtain q. Since q is already present in S1, the resolved clause is not added to S2.\n5. Also, clauses (\u00acp \u2228 q) and (q) can be resolved to obtain \u00acp, and since \u00acp is not in S1, it will be added to S2.\n6. Thus, after the first loop iteration, S0 = {}, S1 = {(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)}, S2 = {\u00acp}. The final output therefore is [[{};{};\u2286{}];[{\u00acp \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 q}, {q}];[\u2205];[{{\u00acp}}]].\n\nHowever, since we are requested to put the answer in the format [[];[];[];[]], the correct answer is [[{};{};\u2205];[{(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)}];[{\u2205}];[{{\u00acp}}]]."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIf the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is what?\nIf the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is what?\nIf the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\nIf the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[true/false];[true/false];[true/false];[true/false]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[false];[true];[false];[false]]"}

LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nA.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\nTaiyi, an ancient Chinese philosophical term. \"Tai\" means supreme and extreme, \"yi\" means absolutely unique.

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
