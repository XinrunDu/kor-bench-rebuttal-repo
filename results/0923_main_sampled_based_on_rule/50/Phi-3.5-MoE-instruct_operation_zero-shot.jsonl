So, 19※28=24.\n\n28※4:\n28 is a multiple of 4. 28※4= 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n4※13:\nNeither 4 is a multiple of 13, nor 13 is a multiple of 4. Thus, 4※13=24.\n\nNow, substituting these results back into the original equation, we get:\n\n24※9※24※(X※13) = 3\n\nNext, simplify 24※9. As neither 24 is a multiple of 9 nor 9 is a multiple of 24, 24※9=24.\nNow our equation becomes:\n\n24※24※(X※13) = 3\n\nWe then simplify 24※24. Neither 24 is a multiple of 24 nor 24 is a multiple of 24. So, 24※24=24.\nOur equation turns to:\n\n24※(X※13) = 3\n\nFinally, solve 24※(X※13) = 3. If we apply the rule, we understand that 24 and X※13 must have a scenario when neither is a multiple of the other. This leads to 24※(X※13)=24. Apply this to the equation:\n\n24 = 3, clearly an error.\n\nLet's reassess the last part again. Based on the original rule,\na※b = 24 if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a. \nThus, in the format 24※(X※13) = 3 to be true, X※13 must be equal to a value such that 24※(X※13) = 3. Based on the established rule, the only way this can happen, considering 24 = 24 + 2, is if 24※(X※13) deviates from the normal rule to a different value which equals 3. As it stands, no value of X≠13 will achieve this, implying that [[X is 13]]. \n\nHowever, if we follow directly the 24※(X※13) = 3 without deviating from the pre-established rules, then no integer value for X will solve this equation as the lowest result would be 24. This presents an inconsistency in the problem as it's written. \n\nIf we're to follow the original rules strictly, then there is no valid numerical answer. However, if we interpreted a punctual exception to the rules to solve the equation, then [[X is 13]] to close off this problem. Hence the answer depends on whether or not we strictly adhere to the rules or if we're open to exceptions."}

For example, X ≥ 5 or X ≤ 10.\nUse only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\". No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Let's break down the equation step by step. First, let's find the values of (6 $ X) and (9 § 2).\n\n(6 $ X) means to select the smaller between 6 and X.\n(9 § 2) means to select the larger between 9 and 2, which is 9.\n\nNow, the given equation is: (6 $ X) + (9 § 2) = 15\n\nSubstitute the values: (6 $ X) + 9 = 15\n\nTo isolate X, we can subtract 9 from both sides: (6 $ X) = 6\n\nRecall that (6 $ X) means to select the smaller between 6 and X. The only value for X that satisfies the inequality (6 $ X) = 6 is X = 6, because if X is less than 6, then 6 would not be the smaller value. Therefore, X must be greater than or equal to 6 to ensure that 6 is still the smaller value.\n\n[[X ≥ 6]]"}

Evaluate (X § 10): Since the operation § chooses the larger number, this will always be either X or 10, with X being the larger number if X > 10 and 10 being the larger number if X ≤ 10.\n\n2. Evaluate (4 $ 2): The operation $ chooses the smaller number, so this will always be 2.\n\nNow our equation looks like this: (X § 10) / 2 = 5\n\nNext, we solve for (X § 10):\n\n(X § 10) = 5 * 2\n(X § 10) = 10\n\nLastly, apply the operation to find X:\n\nIf X ≥ 10, then X § 10 = X.

Starting with 3¥X, then applying ¥6 onto the result.\n\nStep 1: Find 3¥X = 3^X - X^3\n\nStep 2: Apply 6 onto the result from step 1 to get (3¥X)¥6 = (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^(3^X - X^3)\n\nNow, we are given that 3¥X¥6 = -1, so:\n\n(3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^(3^X - X^3) = -1\n\nNow, we must find the value of X. Note that this is hard to solve algebraically, so let's think about it by examining prime and small power values. Testing X=1:\n\n(3^1 - 1^3)^6 - 6^(3^1 - 1^3) = (3 - 1)^6 - 6^(3 - 1) = 2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28 (not -1)\n\nX=2:\n\n(3^2 - 2^3)^6 - 6^(3^2 - 2^3) = (9 - 8)^6 - 6^(9 -8) = 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5 (not -1)\n\nX=3:\n\n(3^3 - 3^3)^6 - 6^(3^3 - 3^3) = 0^6 - 6^0 = 1 - 1 = 0 (not -1)\n\nX=4:\n\n(3^4 - 4^3)^6 - 6^(3^4 - 4^3) = (81 - 64)^6 - 6^(81 -64) = 17^6 - 6^17\n\nThe 6^17 value is incomprehensibly large, so this probably isn't our solution.\n\nX=5:\n\n(3^5 - 5^3)^6 - 6^(3^5 - 5^3) = (243 - 125)^6 - 6^(243 -125) = 118^6 - 6^118\nEven larger term, this is probably not it either, this value is too large.\n\nX=6:\n\n(3^6 - 6^3)^6 - 6^(3^6 - 6^3) = (729 - 216)^6 - 6^(729-216)\nSimilarly, 6^(729-216) is less likely to work due to its huge magnitude.\n\nFrom the above test values, it appears X=2 is the most likely candidate.\n\nNow, let's validate:\n\nStep 1 with X=2:\n3¥2 = 3^2 - 2^3 = 9 - 8 = 1\n\nStep 2 with X=2 and the result of step 1 (which is 1):\n1¥6 = 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5\n\nThis doesn't equal -1, so there's likely a mistake in thinking. We should go back and reassess.\n\nAfter re-assessing, we realize that we looked at (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^(3^X - X^3) directly, but we must apply 6 directly to the result of 3¥X (not to the entire binomial).\nSo, we actually need:\n\nStep 2 with X=2: \n1¥6 = 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5 (which was incorrect previously). Let's redo it correctly:\n\n(3^2 - 2^3)¥6 = ((3^2 - 2^3)^6 - 6^(3^2 - 2^3))\nThe expression within parentheses reduces to 1.\n\n1¥6 = 1^6 - 6^1\nWhich equals -5 as before.\n\nHowever, we made another mistake. The correct expression should actually be:\n\n1¥6 = (1)^6 - 6^(1) = 1 - 6 = -5\n\nBut we need to do the entire operation, remembering that \"^\" is applied before \"-\". We first do the exponent (-5^6 is different from (-5)^6), then do the subtraction.\n\nThe correct calculation is ((1)^6) - (6^1) = 1 - 6 = -5. This still does not work, we need to find the correct X. Let's test X=1 again:\n\nStep 1 (3¥1):\n3¥1 = 3^1 - 1^3 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nStep 2 (2¥6):\n2¥6 = 2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28\n\nTherefore, the correct value of X is not 1 or 2.\n\nUsing trial and error to find the correct answer, we eventually find that X=3 works:\n\nStep 1 (3¥3):\n3¥3 = 3^3 - 3^3 = 27 - 27 = 0\n\nStep 2 (0¥6):\n0¥6 = 0^6 - 6^0 = 0 - 1 = -1\n\nThus, after carefully and patiently assessing the problem, we find that X = 3.
