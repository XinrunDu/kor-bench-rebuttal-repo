We need to consider the rule based on whether X is a multiple of 7 or not.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7\nSince the rule states that if a is not a multiple of b (7※X from our previous step), then a※b = 24, but that cannot be true since our current result 7※X is already 4, not 24. So, X cannot be a multiple of 7.\n\nCase 2: X is not a multiple of 7\nUnder this assumption, the rule would imply that 7※X = 24. However, this contradicts our earlier result of 7※X equal to 4.\n\nSince neither assumption works, there seems to be a contradiction. Here's the key: The operation rule only applies when the first part of the operation (7※X) results in a fractional number. Since we already have 7※X equal to 4 (a whole number), we can't apply the operation to get a result of 4.\n\nTherefore, within the given operation rules, there is no value of X that would satisfy the expression 25※5※X=4.

Next, according to the rule, we apply the second operation to the result and the number 4:\n4②(result from step 1) = 4 × (√X + 2)\n\nWe are given that 4②(X①2) = 20, so we have:\n4 × (√X + 2) = 20\n\nNow, we solve for X:\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n√X + 2 = 20 / 4\n√X + 2 = 5\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n√X = 5 - 2\n√X = 3\n\nNow square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n(√X)^2 = 3^2\nX = 9\n\nSo the answer is [[9]]\n\n"}
