This means that for the first 3 letters, we can choose 3 of the 5 given letters (and possibly some possible rearrangements of letters, but since we are dealing with the 3 state and we have 3 letters), while for the 3 state, we need to choose 3 of the 5 letters. To align with the rule provided clearly and explicitly, we would solve for 3 state words first, and then arrange them as a 3 state * 2 state word. Here's the solution within the constraints:\n\n- 3 state * 3 state word: [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]]\n\nSo, the answer is [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]].

To find all hidden words, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Arrange the set of words in a chessboard-like format. For example, BACH, MOZART, BRAHMS should be placed in the following format:\n   BACH (12,4)(12,1)  \n   MOZART(13,7)(13,2)  \n   BRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\n\n2. Each letter in each word should be at the starting point and disappear at the end point. For example, CBAOT doesn't appear, as it would have been at the same position across two lines.\n   CBAOT (5,7)(10,10)\n   BWhat (3,5)(1,7)  \n   Did (8,8)(1,1)  \n   TOT (13,11)(7,5)\n   MOBAot (14,9)(8,9)\n   HANTA (8,4)(14,9)\n   MOR (13,8)(13,2)  \n   ABAOT (7,1)(17,8)\n   ABAOT (15,11)(7,1)\n   TOT (11,2)(11,11)\n\n3. The answer should be provided as a list of coordinates that indicate the start and end points of the hidden words, e.g., BACH (12,4)(12,1) and MOZART(13,7)(13,2). The order of the words should be the same as the order in the word list.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Step 1: Arrange the words with respect to their start and end points\nBACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2)\nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\n\n### Step 2: Check for the end of each word (i.e., where it appears on the chessboard)\nBACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2)\nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the positions of the last symbol displayed in the passéverse of the word (i.e., the backward part of the word)\nBACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2)\nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\nLast symbol = B\n\n### Step 4: Implode the 'R' letter and find its position on the chessboard, noting that R C is across the white squares (column 5).\nBACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2) \nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\n\n### Step 5: Find the positions of the final 'C' letter and its 'T' partner, marked as T C Y, that are on the overt side. We can find the location of T by hitting the middle square in the over side of the word. The last symbol = T\nBACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2) \nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the coordinates of the last symbol, marked C. The coordinates refer to the 'T'es bottom left corner'.

Every time you happen to encounter a permutation of the letters that exactly fits one of the words on the grid, use it as a solution for that word. \n\nFor this case, you need to find a hidden word, for which you can only backtrack the following specific layout:\n\n1- ROW 12, COLUMN 1 2- COLUMN 1 3- ROW 12, COLUMN 3 4- ROW 10, COLUMN 5 5- ROW 8, COLUMN 3 6- ROW 12, COLUMN 2 7- ROW 8, COLUMN 2 8- COLUMN 1 9- ROW 1, COLUMN 2 10- COLUMN 1\n\nHint: 1- COLUMN 1 2- ROW 12 3- COLUMN 3 4- ROW 2 5- COLUMN 3, 6- REQUIRE AT LEAST 1 LETTER 1- COLUMN 5 2- COLUMN 2, 3- ROW 4, 4- COLUMN 1 5- ROW 1 6- COLUMN 3 and 7- COLUMN 5 8- ROW 2 9- COLUMN 5 10- COLUMN 2\n\nThe above happens to be the answer."}

You should solve this using a hypothetical set of symbols and find the correct number based on the step 2 operation when given the 125 value.\n\nFor instance, consider the set of symbols as follows:\n\n**Set of Operations:**\n- Assumption - (Equality -)\n- Assumption: Unions - \n- Choice of elements: Between the numbers 0 to 9, except for 9 (exclusive)^ Since we're sure that the string of 9s are allowed, \n  the set of coordinates comes out to be `{`} because the binary operation is valid only with one operator but with both and one empty.\n\nUsing this set of symbols and the given equation, remember that we'll solve this using \"Assumption\": Unions in the top 9, possibly Indexed by the leftmost 10 without the intersection, followed by union in the last 9 we don't use, totaling `[9...9]`.\n\nGiven the available operations sign, we could add the above set of `9` along with the constraints (`+`, `*`), to end with the `9` in the `boxes`. Since we're not including any special case of a special symbol or symbol following `\\?.` we're left with the possibilities of:\n- \\(0\\), `9`, `98`, `99`, `9.9`, `9.9.8`, `9.9.9.8`, and `9.98.8`.\n- \\(9\\) and `0` (`9*.9`) or `90`.\n- ```\\`\n9\n0.9\n\\`\n``` where `9` appears from the right side.\nHere`s a succinct solution using this thought process:\n\n```python\n# Let's start by slightly modifying the 9 letter string to make this self-contained.\n# a          b          c          d          e          f\na b c d e f\n\n# The set of operations\nops = \"+- . *\"\n\noperation_count = 0\n\n# Thoughts on the layout of numbers:\n# 9 (1st position)        | currently `o` (Multiplication) and `n` (Division)\n# +                          | exactly 4 locations under the number\n# or a separation, which is a `9` at the end\n# /                          | separating the operation symbols from the inner slot\n\n# Here, we need to either split the operation and the number being operated on in the same line.\n# best guess in this part - combine the operation and number in one space `.` along with the next *\"...\n# follow it by `- `' to put the operator back after `'` subtracting \"-\", what we get above \"9.\"\n\n# Arithmetic operations\n\n#7\n( 9 *.1 ) - (9 * 1)  \n\n#8\n(doc9 + 1) - (doc9 + 2)\n\n#98 foxx\n(doc9+.9) + (doc9+.99)\n\n#999\n( doc9       + 1     )* (doc9       + 1    )               \n\n#99.9\n(doc ?* ?* ?* ?*>:: + (doc ?* ?* ?* ?*>:: + (doc ?* ?* ?* ?*>::)))\n\n#999.9.9\n(doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)* (doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?+ ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)* (doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)*    (doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?])*\n\n#we whisper\n(doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)* ?(doc ?* ?* ?* + ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)* (?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* .* ?)*     (doc ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?* ?)*\n\n# here goes\nwrite4(      9  * 7 ) *   trk(      9  * 7 ) *\n\n#9.999.999  And multiply the number by itself again\nwrite4(       9       9       9       9           9       9       9       9                   9       9       9       9                       9       9      9     *     9 *     9       9       9     *     9    *    *   *   *\nwrite4(        9        9        9       9       9        9       9       9       9                   9       9       9       9                       9       9      9     *     9 *  * *  *   * \nwrite4(         9       9       9       9       9         9       9       9       9                   99         9       9       9       9                   99      99       9                  )\n\n#9.9,99,999,9999,99,99,999,999\nisdigit( 9  * 7 )   ? 3      ? `yes ` ```\nisdigit( 9       9       9       9           9       9       9       9                   9       9       9       9                       9       9      9     *     9 *     9       9       9     *     9    *    *   * `yes `  \n\n# Multiple alternative solutions\n\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  &&)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  &&)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  &&)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  ||)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  ||)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  &&)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  ||)\n\\cript\\cript\\cript\\cript*?(write3  urrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr)\n\n```"}
