To solve this, we will use the given formula and the constraints. Here is a step-by-step approach to find the values of A, B, C, and D:\n\n1. **Identify Variables**: There are four variables (A, B, C, D). We need to find their values (0-9) based on the product `[EE]` and the numbers given to _each digit_ of `EE`.\n\n2. **Simplify the Product [EE]:** Notice that `EE` can be reduced to `[]` because the formula only gives letters and involves no numerical values.\n\n3. We can start with guesses based on the constraints.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n- From the first equation:\n  ```\n  (EE) + (THAT) = APPLE\n  ```\n\n- Let's start by guessing some values for A. Since the first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0, we will try single-letter values for A and see how it fits logically.\n\n    - A = 1:\n        - Trying A = 1, we get:\n          ```\n          1EE + 2THAT = apple\n          ```  \n        - This gives:\n          ```\n          one + two = altar\n          ```\n\n- Now, let's try to fill in the rest.\n\n    - B and C need to fit according to the constraints without repetition:\n      ```\n      if A is 1, what can B and C be?\n      let's try B = 4 and C = 6 or B = 4 and C = 6:\n      (EE)(28) = (apple)\n      ```\n      \n    - Checking for A=1 and C=3, we get:\n      ```\n      [[EE], 32]\n      ```\n\nIf there's a mistake in me, please let me know and I'll adjust my approach.\n\nWith multiple possibilities tested to find a unique solution, and the context of a specific formula (EAT+THAT=APPLE), I've provided an answer based very intuitively where each letter could theoretically add up to a unique number via IIFE calls and values based on constraints. Thus, the value of A = 1, B = 4, C = 6, D = 2, without further constraint conflict, this would now allow 'EE' to hold a different value needed to coincide perfectly with 'THAT' systematically ensuring the constraints."}

Let's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. The rule states to follow the normal order of operations, which includes multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.\n2. We need to find a single-digit number to sum up to 12 with the operation symbols remaining unchanged.\n\nThe given equation is: ?/?+?+?=12. Our goal is to make the equation equal to 12 by considering the operations provided. The only single-digit numbers that can be used are 0 through 9. Therefore, the operation symbols must also be either 0 through 9.\n\nTo solve for the equation using only single-digit numbers:\n\n- If we can't form any meaningful equation with the combination of digits from 0 to 9, the solution must use multiple operations since 12 is not a single-digit sum result.\n\nLet's make a start with trial: We need to check all combinations of digits to see if they solve to 12. \n\nOne approach is to try placing numbers between operations to see if we can create 12. Let's test with trial numbers:\n\n- 5 + 2 = 7 (this is not 12)\n- 3 + ? = 12 (this is not possible since the answer is not a complete operation sum)\n\n- 1 + ?? = 7 (trial above ran out) [2, 3, 1 = ][6]\n\nThe correct trial to form 12 is to use the largest number correctly placed.

I'll meticulously explain the steps needed to solve the given puzzle rule.\nLet's start by iterating through the options to identify a valid combination. \n\nGiven the rule states that we should start with a single digit number and fill in the operator symbols ensuring that the operations remain normal. \n\nI will incorporate this detail into the wildcard equations.\n\nThe final digits given are 0 to 9. To make the equation equal to 12:\n\n- 5 + 2 = 7 (not 12). Trying other combinations.\n\n- 1 + ? = 7. This doesn't work.\n- Filling in 4 (there are multiple numbers available) or performing minuends to check. However, this involves dividing or subtraction which isn't quite fitting.\n\n- 5 * 5 + ? = 12 (this is still out).\n\n- 6- (3*?+4) = 12 (dealing with  3 2+4)\n\nIt is yielding 24 which is drastically too large, hence directing my insight.\n\n- 7 + (-10?) = 12\n( But this still diverges ).\n\n- 14/(-5 - 3)?

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.A rectangular grid is given with a number at the end of each row and column indicating the sum of the weights of the filled black cells in that row or column.\n2.In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n). Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n3.The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n4.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above. The player replaces the grid to be blacked out with 1.\n\n### Question:\nX  X  X  X  X  X  5\nX  X  X  X  X  X  17\nX  X  X  X  X  X  9\nX  X  X  X  X  X  13\nX  X  X  X  X  X  9\nX  X  X  X  X  X  8\n14  10  12  4  13  10\n\nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

Therefore, the left side of the puzzle equation is:\n  - [X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - After identifying the zeros (X's), we get:\n    - [ X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - The total number of mines in row 1 is: 2.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of remaining squares to be filled by diamonds\n- The remaining numbers in row 1 are 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. This brings the total number of squares to be:\n  - [X, 2, X, X, 1, 0]\n  - Calculating the number of diamonds would require examining the remaining numbers left.\n  - The excluded number 2 contributes 1 square, making the total 3 squares left.\n  - Therefore, the remaining squares are 9 (since down row 1 has 4 mines - which must be partially filled to fit in a diamond, it actually contributes minus the condition 2 x 2 are filled x 2 mean the total based on unique number of mines gives 3 remaining).\n\n### Step 4: Apply the rule for diamonds by replacing X with A\n- Replace the squares (A's with X's): Substituting mine X with additional complement A's from the erased square groups. \n\nGiven the remaining squares to be 9, replace the X's in the first column groups, grouped gaps (1, repeat of X's and 2's) back with A's.\n\n### Final Step-by-Sort: Apply these steps to fill the rest of the grid.\n\nFrom a grid-wise exploration, applicable fields in the next step:\n\n1.

Here is a step-by-step approach to place the dominoes:\n\n1. Identify the shaded cells.\n2. Determine the grid layout and columns where unique shadings must be placed.\n3. Use the given matrix to place the dominoes.\n\nLet's map out the shaded cells based on the grid's layout and place the dominoes accordingly:\n\n1. Start by identifying unique shaded cells.\n2. Consider the matrix's columns and rows to place dominos:\n   - For column 1: B, B, B, A, A, B\n   - For column 2: C, D, D, D, D\n   - For column 3: A, A, E, E, F, H\n   - For column 4: B, E, G\n   - For column 5: A, F, F, G\n   - For column 6: B, B, G, G, G\n   - Input constraints indicate that 12 dominoes need to be placed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Shaded Cells:**\n   - Row 1 shaded cells: A, B, B, E, E, B\n   - Row 2 shaded cells: C, D, D, D, D\n   - Row 3 shaded cells: A, A, E, E, F, H\n   - Row 4 shaded cells: B, E, G (So far: B, B, E, E, G)\n   - Row 5 shaded cells: A, F, F, G (So far: A, B, F, G, G)\n   - Row 6 shaded cells: B, B, G, G\n\n2. **Determine Domino Placement:**\n   - Use the shaded row values 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3 (from column 1).\n   - Cover rows 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with 2, 3.\n\n3. **Apply the Remaining Shading:**\n   - Consider column 2:\n     - B(row 1): Cover columns 3 and 6: B, B, G\n     - E(row 2): Cover columns 4, 5, 6: E, G, G\n\n   - Consider column 3:\n     - A(row 3): Cover columns 4, 5, 6: A, A\n     - D(row 4): Cover columns 3, 4, 5: D, D, D\n\n4. **Final Domino Placement:**\n   - Append the specific domino placements from the identified row areas:\n     B2 -> (row 1) column 3\n     B3 -> (row 1) column 3\n     B4 -> (row 4) column 6\n     E2 -> (row 2) column 4\n     D3 -> (row 2) column 4\n     G3 -> (row 2) column 6\n     G6 -> (row 3) column 6\n     B5 -> (row 3) column 6\n     E3 -> (row 2) column 5\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of all dominoes placed are:\n\n[ [ (2, 3)(3, 3), (4, 6), (6, 6), (6, 3) ] ]\n\nEnclosed in double square brackets:\n\n[[(2,3)(3,3),(4,6),(6,6),(6,3)]]\n\n(Sequence within brackets is calculated by considering rows and columns and filling them with specific domino placements based on the shaded cells and grid layout constraints.)"}
