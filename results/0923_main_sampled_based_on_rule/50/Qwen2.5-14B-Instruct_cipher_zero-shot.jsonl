Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet. For example, Z maps to A, Y maps to B.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TNKGPHLSYPV\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The plaintext \"G\" is grouped into a single block since it has less than 5 characters (for encryption, \"G\" alone will use the same grid calculations rules as a 5-character block).\n\n2. Grid selection is determined by the formula `grid_index = (i // 5) % 8`. Since we have only one character and it corresponds to the 0th block, `i = 0`:\n   - `grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0`\n   - This means we use Grid0 for encryption.\n\n3. In Grid0, the letter \"G\" is found in the third row and second column (Grid0's structure can be looked up from the rules).\n\n4. According to the encryption rule, for each character, we move one grid position to the lower right from this position. The character one position to the lower right of \"G\" in Grid0 goes from (row 2, col 1) to (row 3, col 2).\n\n5.

So, we need to locate the position in the top row, last column of the alphabet (index 4) of the corresponding column.\n\n   - In the first row of Grid0:\n     - The character in the 4th column is \"E\".\n\nThus, the decrypted character of \"B\" is \"E\".\n\nGiven the output format, the answer is: [[E]]"}

Given the length of the ciphertext is 10 characters, we get two blocks.\n\n- For the 0th block \"GMKWV\": \n    - grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0, which means we'll use Grid0.\n    - Looking up 'G' in Grid0, it’s found at row=2, col=1. Moving to the upper left (row-1, col-1) brings us to 'L'.\n    - Looking up 'M' in Grid0, it’s found at row=3, col=3. This calculation brings us to 'H'.\n    - 'K' is at row=3, col=1, and moving upper-left gives us 'I'.\n    - 'W' is at row=1, col=4. Moving up-left brings us to 'S'.\n    - 'V' is at row=4, col=4. Moving up-left results in 'Z'.\n- The 0th block decrypted is \"LHISZ\".\n\n- For the 1st block \"QPNWT\":\n    - grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 1, which means we'll use Grid1.\n    - 'Q' is at row=0, col=2. Moving up-left gives us 'O'.\n    - 'P' is at row=3, col=1. Moving up-left results in 'G'.\n    - 'N' is at row=1, col=4. Moving up-left brings us to 'H'.\n    - 'W' is at row=0, col=4. Moving up-left gives us 'V'.\n    - 'T' is at row=1, col=3. Moving up-left brings us to 'G'.\n- The 1st block decrypted is \"OGHVG\".\n\nConcatenating the results from each block, we get the plaintext \"LHISZOGHVG\".\n\nTherefore, the final decrypted answer is [[LHISZOGHVG]]."}

Let's decrypt the ciphertext character by character:\n\n1. S -> inner_disk index: 2 -> outer_disk index 2 = T\n2. M -> inner_disk index: 10 -> outer_disk index 10 = P\n3. S -> inner_disk index: 2 -> outer_disk index 2 = T\n4. U -> inner_disk index: 6 -> outer_disk index 6 = G\n5. H -> inner_disk index: 26 % 26 (26) -> outer_disk index 26 = R\n6. S -> inner_disk index: 2 -> outer_disk index 2 = T\n7. Y -> inner_disk index: 8 -> outer_disk index 8 = H\n8. I -> inner_disk index: 16 -> outer_disk index 16 = Z (After decrypting 8 characters, rotate the inner disk 1 step: 'KLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIOP')\n9. Z -> new inner_disk index: 19 -> outer_disk index 19 = V\n10. R -> new inner_disk index: 8 -> outer_disk index 8 = H\n11. Z -> new inner_disk index: 19 -> outer_disk index 19 = V\n12.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"VO\" according to the given cipher rules:\n\n1. Convert \"V\" and \"O\" into Morse code: \"V\" is \"...-\", and \"O\" is \"---\".\n2. Combine Morse codes (separated by /): \"...-/-...\".\n3. Split the Morse code string into character pairs and convert them into numeric strings based on the provided mapping:\n   - \"..\" maps to \"5\"\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The '-' in \"V\" is split into two, consider them separately)\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The second '-' in \"V\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The '.' in \"V\")\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The first '-' in \"O\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The second '.' in \"O\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The third '.' in \"O\")\n4. Assemble the numeric sequence considering the mapping: For \"...-\", we get \"5665\". For \"---.\", it translates to \"655\".\n5. Therefore, the numeric representation will be \"5665/655\".\n\nHowever, observing the rule's letter-to-Morse and Morse-to-number mapping strictly:\n- For Morse \"..\", we use \"5\"\n- For Morse \".\", we use \"5\"\n- For Morse \"-\", we use \"6\"\n- For Morse \"---\", it becomes \"666\"\n- For Morse \"...\", it becomes \"555\"\nThus, correctly mapping \"V\" (which is \"...-\") should be \"5556\" and \"O\" (which is \"---\") should be \"666\". Then splitting them in pairs according to above table.\n\nSo, for \"V\" (Morse: \"...-\") -> \"5556\":\n- Pair1: \"55\" -> \"9\"\n- Pair2: \"56\" -> \"3\"\n\nAnd \"O\" (Morse: \"---\") -> \"666\":\n- Pair1: \"66\" -> \"7\"\n- Pair2: \"6\" -> As \"6\" need to pair, it will be last: \"6\"\n\nAs \"..\" at the beginning and end is not directly a pair; thus, we recognize: \"5556/666\".\nSplitting would be transformed into: \"55\", \"56\", \"66\", \"6\".\nFollowing mapping comes to 9, 3, 7, 6.\n\nTherefore, final assembled encryption will observe:\n- For \"V\": \"93\"\n- For \"O\": \"76\"\n\nThus, combining as [[93/76]]. So the correct representation based on encryption rules is:\n[[93/76]]"}

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (There is no letter J.Its row and column coordinates are between 0 and 4.):\n        - U  B  I  L  A\n        N  T  C  D  E\n        F  G  H  K  M\n        O  P  Q  R  S\n        V  W  X  Y  Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from plaintext.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n    - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"YOLMHUMIVOW\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"YOLMHUMIVOW\" using the given cipher rules:\n\n- Remove spaces and J (if present): \"YOLMHUMIVOW\" (no removal needed in this case).\n- Identify the coordinates of each letter from the given 5x5 grid:\n    - Y: (4, 4)\n    - O: (3, 0)\n    - L: (0, 3)\n    - M: (2, 4)\n    - H: (2, 2)\n    - U: (0, 4)\n    - I: (0, 1)\n    - V: (4, 0)\n    - O: (3, 0)\n    - W: (4, 3)\n\n- Arrange the coordinates first by rows then by columns: 4302200003414403\n- Form the ciphertext by pairs of the new coordinate sequence:\n    - (4, 3): E\n    - (0, 2): C\n    - (2, 0): N\n    - (2, 4): X\n    - (0, 1): B\n    - (0, 2): C\n    - (1, 4): L\n    - (4, 4): Y\n    - (0, 3): F\n    - (3, 0): N\n\nSo the final encrypted answer is: [[ECNXCBCLYFNC]]"}

L1_col=4, L2_row=5.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"SD\", we follow the encryption rules specified:\n\n- First, since \"SD\" is less than 6 characters long, we need to pad it with `#` to make it 6 characters long. So the plaintext becomes \"SD######\".\n- Next, we split \"SD######\" into groups of 6 characters. Since the entire string now is exactly 6 characters, we only need to handle this one group.\n\nNow we process the group \"SD#\":\n\nBinary groups are created as follows:\n- The first binary group is (S, D).\n\nFor (S, D):\n\n- In Grid 1:\n    - S is at row 1, column 2. Hence, `l1_row = 1, l1_col = 2`.\n- In Grid 2:\n    - D is at row 2, column 0. Hence, `l2_row = 2, l2_col = 0`.\n- In Grid 3:\n    - The cell at row `l1_row = 1` and column `l2_col = 0` has the value `4`.\n\nSo, for the ternary (S, D):\n- The output is (2, 4, 2).\n\nSince we only have one group (\"SD#\") and \"SD#\" after the split trivially results in one binary group (S, D), there's no second binary group to compute.\n\nHence, the ciphertext for \"SD\" is the number string we formed: `242`.\n\nBut according to the exact spec and the usual practice of the padding involved in dealing with full-length characters (as the grid operations are defined for specific lengths), we correctly account only for the characters directly processed from \"SD\".\n\n[[242]]"}

Combining reading down and up gives us: MCVCE, but since we alternated reading and ended exactly on a down read without any additional characters from the top row, we need to fill in the top row by reading it as it is:\n\nThe arrangement in reading down and up:\n- Down read (first cycle): M\n- Up read (first cycle, fills V from E column and second row M, leaves a # at the start of remaining rows): M#V\n- Down read (second cycle): CV\n- Up read (last cycle): CE\n\nCombining these reads gives us: M#CVE.\n\n4.

There are none, so we are done.\n\nThe deciphered plaintext is:\n```\nKORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH\n```\n\nHowever, the layout should correspond to a coherent message according to the rules, suggesting that `#` were only placeholders and should not repeat in the final plaintext unless it was part of it.\n\nHence, the clean final decrypted answer should be:\n```\n[[KORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH]]\n```\n\nBut, it is expected to be a continuous message, so let's confirm carefully:\nBy double-checking the steps, we can see the structure is correct and it represents the properly ordered letters. Therefore, the typical decryption retains the initial sequence but checks for any suppositions:\n```\n[[KORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH]]\n```\n\nBut for clear coherence, let us finalize the plaintext message by reassessing any unintentional extra arrangement, leading to just pure text:\n```\n[[KORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH]]\n```\nwhich should be adjusted directly for a coherent answer format:\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is:\n```\n[[KORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH]]\n```\nUpon ensuring exact fit, we revalidate:\n```\n[[KORMZKMMSAHHNVHFCERH]]\n```"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"######UH###MF###\", we'll follow the steps outlined in the decryption rule.\n\nFirst, let's divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters:\n- First block: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nLet's represent the first block according to the grid:\n\nSince the ciphertext is 16 letters long, it will fill the grid with the following layout (based on the template):\n\nOriginal template positions viewed as grid fill:\n```\n[['######', '##', '##', '##'],\n ['##', 'UH', '##', '##'],\n ['#', '##', 'M', '##'],\n ['#', 'F', '##', '#']]\n```\nThe holes/positions in the template across rotations will reveal letters from the grid if they are filled as described.\n\nSince we are decrypting, let's place the filled ciphertext into the grid row by row and apply the template rotations to extract the plaintext:\n\nThe grid filled row by row:\n```\n######\n######\n##UH#\n##M##\n#F###\n#####\n```\nNow we apply the template:\n\n1. First fill:\n   - Template Positions: (1,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2)\n   - Letters read: U, H, M, F\n   - After first rotation:\n2. Second fill (90-degree rotation):\n   - Template Positions: (1,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)\n   - Rotated Template reveals the remaining letters, but only if existing in grid in correct positions.\n\nBy decrypting each block step-by-step with the template, we read out the letters that are visible through the holes during each rotation.\n\nSo reading the letters from each hole position through rotations, we get the plaintext:\n[[UMHF]]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted plaintext from the provided ciphertext is:\n[[UMHF]]"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

To reverse this for decryption, we need to rearrange the positions back to their original sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n\nTo map the ciphertext to the original positions:\n- Original column 0 contains the character from the 2nd position (index 1) in the ciphertext (A).\n- Original column 1 contains the character from the 1st position (index 0) in the ciphertext (L).\n- Original column 2 contains the character from the 6th position (index 5) in the ciphertext (A).\n- Original column 3 contains the character from the 7th position (index 6).\n- Original column 4 contains the character from the 5th position (index 4) in the ciphertext (Z).\n- Original column 5 contains the character from the 3rd position (index 2) in the ciphertext (K).\n- Original column 6 contains the character from the 4th position (index 3) in the ciphertext (Z).\n\nTherefore, the reordered string is:\n- Original column 0: A\n- Original column 1: L\n- Original column 2: A\n- Original column 3: X (from the end of the ciphertext, since there's only enough for 7 characters)\n- Original column 4: Z\n- Original column 5: K\n- Original column 6: Z\n\nResulting in \"ALKXZAZ\", but since X and the extra Z could indicate fillers ($), we can read the first four characters as the plaintext.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"9C9C9986938C9784\" based on the Cipher Rule defined, we will follow the decryption steps carefully:\n\n1. **Block Splitting**:\n   - The ciphertext is already given in the form of an 8-byte (16-character hexadecimal) block: \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n\n2. **Convert Hex to Bytes**:\n   - Convert \"9C9C9986938C9784\" from a hexadecimal string to bytes: `\\x9C\\x9C\\x99\\x86\\x93\\x8C\\x97\\x84`.\n\n3. **XOR with Key**:\n   - Key = `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`.\n   - XOR operation between `\\x9C\\x9C\\x99\\x86\\x93\\x8C\\x97\\x84` and `b'1234567890ABCDEF'` results in: `\\x8E\\x6E\\x2D\\x22\\x87\\x72\\x89\\x00`.\n\n4. **Inverse Permute**:\n   - Rotate each byte right by 1 bit.\n   - Resulting byte sequence is: `\\xC8\\xDE\\xA3\\xA1\\x48\\xA4\\x44\\x80`.\n\n5. **Substitute**:\n   - Use the INV_S_BOX to substitute the high 4 bits and low 4 bits:\n     - `\\xC8` -> `\\x1C`\n     - `\\xDE` -> `\\x76`\n     - `\\xA3` -> `\\x4B`\n     - `\\xA1` -> `\\x48`\n     - `\\x48` -> `\\x03`\n     - `\\xA4` -> `\\x47`\n     - `\\x44` -> `\\x00`\n     - `\\x80` -> `\\x08`\n   - Substituted byte sequence becomes: `\\x1C\\x76\\x4B\\x48\\x03\\x47\\x00\\x08`.\n\n6. **XOR with Key**:\n   - XOR the resulting bytes with the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'` again:\n   - `\\x1C\\x76\\x4B\\x48\\x03\\x47\\x00\\x08` XOR `b'1234567890ABCDEF'` equals: `\\x0A\\x6A\\x5F\\x76\\x95\\x3F\\x7E\\x07`.\n\n7. **Convert Bytes to Text**:\n   - Convert `\"\\x0A\\x6A\\x5F\\x76\\x95\\x3F\\x7E\\x07\"` from bytes to ASCII text, which reads: `Aj_v?~`.\n\n8. **Remove Padding**:\n   - Check for and remove any padding characters `\\x00` at the end; in this case, the last `\\x07` is not a padding.\n\nThus, the plaintext after removing any null (padding) characters is `Aj_v?~`. However, given the plaintext will consist of uppercase letters and spaces, the unknown characters `?` and `~` suggest there was a decryption failure or the ciphertext might not have matched expected plaintext format. For strict adherence to the defined plaintext format, we only keep valid letters and spaces:\n\n[[AJ_v]]"}

So, it is padded to \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting**: The text is now fully padded and split into a single block: \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n3. **Block Encryption**:\n   - **Convert to Bytes and XOR with Key**: First, we convert each character in the block to its ASCII byte value:\n     ```\n     'F' -> 0x46, 'W' -> 0x57, '\\x00' -> 0x00 (repeated 6 times)\n     ```\n     The block in byte form is `46 57 00 00 00 00 00 00`.\n     XOR this with the given key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`:\n     ```\n     46 ^ 31 = 15\n     57 ^ 50 = 0D\n     00 ^ 73 = 73\n     00 ^ 4D = 4D\n     00 ^ 27 = 27\n     00 ^ 51 = 51\n     00 ^ AE = AE\n     00 ^ 3F = 3F\n     ```\n     So, the result is `15 0D 73 4D 27 51 AE 3F`.\n   - **Substitute**: Use the S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in each byte:\n     ```\n     15 -> (1 -> 0A, 5 -> 03) -> 0A03 -> 030A = 0A03\n     0D -> (0 -> 0F, D -> 02) -> 0F02 = 0F02\n     73 -> (7 -> 05, 3 -> 05) -> 0505 = 0505\n     4D -> (4 -> 09, D -> 02) -> 0902 = 0902\n     27 -> (2 -> 07, 7 -> 05) -> 0705 = 0705\n     51 -> (5 -> 09, 1 -> 0A) -> 090A = 090A\n     AE -> (A -> 04, E -> 0E) -> 040E = 040E\n     3F -> (3 -> 05, F -> 0C) -> 050C = 050C\n     ```\n     So, after substitution, we have `0A 03 0F 02 05 05 09 02 07 05 09 0A 04 0E 05 0C`.\n     Combining them makes it `0A 03 0F 02 05 05 09 02`.\n   - **Permute**: Rotate each byte left by 1 bit:\n     ```\n     0A -> 10, 03 -> 06, 0F -> F8, 02 -> 40, 05 -> A0, 05 -> A0, 09 -> 20, 02 -> 40\n     ```\n     So, after permutation, we have `10 06 F8 40 A0 A0 20 40`.\n   - **XOR with Key** again, using the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`:\n     ```\n     10 ^ 31 = 21\n     06 ^ 50 = 56\n     F8 ^ 73 = 69\n     40 ^ 4D = 4D\n     A0 ^ 27 = 87\n     A0 ^ 51 = F1\n     20 ^ AE = CA\n     40 ^ 3F = 7F\n     ```\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding and Concatenate**:\n   - The result after XORing is `21 56 69 4D 87 F1 CA 7F`.\n   - Converting this to a hexadecimal string gives `2156694D87F1CA7F`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n[[2156694D87F1CA7F]]"}
