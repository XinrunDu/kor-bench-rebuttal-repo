If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false.

The conjunction ~(\u2713)&\u2713(p2) evaluates to x.\n- If p1 is \u2713 and p2 is x, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to x, and ~(x) evaluates to \u2713. The conjunction ~(\u2713)&x(p2) evaluates to x.\n- If p1 is x and p2 is \u2713, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to \u2713, and ~(\u2713) evaluates to x. The conjunction of x&p2(\u2713) evaluates to \u2713.\n- If p1 is x and p2 is x, then (p1=::>p2) evaluates to \u2713, and ~(\u2713) evaluates to x. The conjunction of x&p2(x) evaluates to x.\n\nSince the formula is not true or false in all cases, it is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula.\n\nFor formula (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n- We need to consider all combinations of p1, p2, and p3.\n- For combinations like (p1=\u2713, p2=\u2713, p3=\u2713), we get (\u2713&\u2713)=(x&x), which simplifies to \u2713=x, which is false.\n- For combinations like (p1=x, p2=x, p3=x), we get (x&x)=(\u2713&\u2713), which simplifies to x=\u2713, which is false.\n- There are multiple such combinations, but the key is to find a combination which could provide a true outcome. Since we can find combinations that yield false results and can't guarantee a true result for every assignment, it's not a truth formula. Further, given the overall structure, we can't guarantee a false result for every assignment either. Hence, it's also not a falsehood formula.\n\nTherefore, the given formula (2) is also neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula.\n\nThe answer should be formatted according to the given format: \n\n[[C];[C]]."}

Using rule (10) for the nested implication `(q>r)`, it becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nComparing the fully simplified forms:\n- `(p>q)>r` becomes `(p | !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo check equivalence, compare `(p | !q) | r` and `!p | (!q | r)` using the given equivalences.\n\n`(p | !q) | r` is not directly equivalent to `!p | (!q | r)` based on the provided equivalences without further steps, but we can see that neither expression directly simplifies or restructures into the other without additional transformations that aren't specified or straightforward under the given rules.\n\nGiven that through direct transformation, none of the provided equivalences directly confirm they are identical forms, and looking closely the structure of the expressions seems to hint towards different outcomes in certain scenarios (as `p` is negated in one and not the other), the conclusion leans towards them not being equivalent under all truth value scenarios.\n\n[[B]]"}

Express `>` using negation and disjunction:\n   - `p>q` can be rewritten as `!p | q` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n   - So, `((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))`\n2. Similarly, `p>(q|r)` can be rewritten as `!p | (q | r)` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n3. Now, let's compare `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` with `!p | (q | r)`:\n   - We can use equivalence (5) to simplify and compare.\n   - By equivalence (5), `!p & (!p | (q & r))` is simplified to `!p | (q | r)`.\n   - But the original expression is `(p>q)&(p>r)` which represents `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   - Analyzing further using Basic Equivalences doesn't simplify to `!p | (q | r)` directly.\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (1) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question (2)\nThe expression given is: `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`\n1. Express `=` using implication:\n   - From rule (11), `p = q ::=:: (!p | q) & (!q | p)`\n2. Negation of `p = q` means negating the implication formula:\n   - `!(p = q) ::=:: ! ((!p | q) & (!q | p))`\n   - Using De Morgan's Law (6 from Basic Equivalences), `!(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B`\n   - This gives us `! (!p | q) | ! (!q | p)`\n   - Applying De Morgan's Law again, `!!p & !q | !q &!!p`\n   - Simplifying `!!` by (1), `p & !q | !q & p`\n   - Which can be interpreted as `!(p&q) | (p|q)`\n   - This expression is equivalent to `(p | q) & !(p & q)`\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (2) is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer adhering to the given format would be: [[B];[A]]"}

Recall that `p\u21d1q` is defined as `!p | !q` and `p\u21d3q` is defined as `!p & !q`.\n\n2. For (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r, it becomes `(!(p\u21d3q)) & !(r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d3` for `p\u21d3q`, we get `(!(!(p & q))) & !(r)`.\n   - Simplifying `!(!(p & q))`, we get `p & q`.\n   - So, `(p\u21d3q)\u21d3r` becomes `(p & q) & !(r)`.\n\n3.

Hence, as a simple answer format, (1) does not hold with direct equivalence as all terms cannot be transformed directly to match the structure of one another under the given logical operators.\n\n4. For (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r, it becomes `!((p\u21d1q) | r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d1` for `p\u21d1q`, we get `!( !p | !q | r )`.\n   - Similarly, for p\u21d1(q\u21d1r), it becomes `!(p | !(q\u21d1r))`.\n   - Substitute the definition for `q\u21d1r`, we get `!(!(q | !r) | p)`, which simplifies logically to `!( !p | !q | !r )`.\n\nSince both expressions simplify to the same form: `! (!p | !q | r)` for the first and `!( !p | !q | !r )` for the second under derivation, they indeed hold the same logical equivalence under the rules provided, considering De Morgan's laws and the definition of NOR operator.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify which of the three statements (from Person A, Person B, or Person C) correspond to the completely correct, partially correct, and entirely incorrect categories based on the provided logical expression. According to the final simplified logical expression,\n\n\\[ E ::=:: (!p \\& q \\& !r) | (p \\& !q \\& r) \\]\n\nwe can derive the truth value of statements from p, q, and r given the condition that exactly one of them is true (and we have a binary choice for the true statement).\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\)\n   - This case is true if Professor Wang is from Shanghai (\\(q\\)) and not from Suzhou (\\(p\\)) and not from Hangzhou (\\(r\\)).\n   - In this condition, Person A's statement `(!p & q)` is entirely correct, Person B's statement `(p & !q)` is entirely incorrect, and Person C's statement `(!q & !r)` is partially correct.\n   - Therefore, in this case: **[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: B]**.\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\)\n   - This case results in Professor Wang being from Hangzhou (\\(r\\)), not from Suzhou (\\(p\\)), and not from Shanghai (\\(q\\)).\n   - In this condition, Person C's statement `(!q & !r)` is entirely incorrect, Person B's statement `(p & !q)` is partially correct, and Person A's statement `(!p & q)` is entirely incorrect.\n   - Therefore, in this case: **[Hangzhou]; [entirely incorrect: A]; [partially correct: B]; [entirely incorrect: C]**, which is logically incorrect as per the formulated conditions and Professor's remark. Thus, option (2) can be invalidated considering only one person is entirely incorrect and one is partly incorrect.\n\nGiven these two case analyses, only Case 1 satisfies the conditions Professor Wang gave that \"one of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\n\nThus, the chosen answer format is:\n\n**[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: B]]**."}

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)V(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)V(p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(p\u2227q\u2227r) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given formula conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form (PNF) or principal conjunctive normal form (CNF), we first examine the structure of the formula and then compare it to our rule definitions.\n\nGiven formula: (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)V(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)V(p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)V(p\u2227q\u2227r)\n\nThis formula is a disjunction of simple conjunctive terms that follow the pattern specified in the logic rule concerning paired conjunctive terms. Let's enumerate each conjunctive term with respect to binary and hexadecimal numbers, as per the guidelines:\n\n1. \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr (000, hex 0) \u2192 m0\n2. \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r (001, hex 1) \u2192 m1\n3. \u00acp\u2227q\u2227r (011, hex 3) \u2192 m3\n4. p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r (101, hex 5) \u2192 m5\n5. p\u2227q\u2227r (111, hex 7) \u2192 m7\n\nThe given formula can thus be interpreted as a disjunction of specific m terms: m0 \u2228 m1 \u2228 m3 \u2228 m5 \u2228 m7.\n\nTo determine if it conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form, we check if it meets the condition that it could be representing all possible assignments or if it matches the specific conditions for a basic, all-even, or all-odd formula.\n\n1. If the formula had all 2^n (in this case 2^3 = 8) paired conjunctive terms, it would be a tautology.\n2. If the indices were all even or all odd, it would be an all-even or all-odd formula.\n\nSince the formula includes m0 (which is a basic condition), it is a basic formula according to the logic rules given:\n\nThe answer is [[A];[m0\u2228m1\u2228m3\u2228m5\u2228m7]], as it conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form and is a basic formula since the conjunctions presented cover different binary assignments but do include m0."}

So it's equivalent to [1].\n- Thus, it translates to SAP.\n\n[4] Some products are unqualified.\n- Particular Negative (O): SOP.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationships as per the given guide:\n- [1] and [2] have * relation, as they are A and E, respectively. One is true if the other is false, and vice versa.\n- [1] and [3] are both SAP (Universal Affirmatives), meaning they're saying the same thing in different ways. Since they are logically equivalent and identical, they have a direct relationship, indicating they support each other in being true.\n- [3] and [4] seem to contradict each other at first glance since [3] (all products are qualified) and [4] (some products are unqualified) do not align; however, if looking strictly by the given classification rules and upon understanding [3] as SAP equivalent, they follow the % relation, where a universal proposition (SAP in [3]) being true means the particular (O in [4]) may be false. Conversely, if [4] is true, [3] must be false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is [[A];[A];[B]], as [1] and [2] have a clear relationship, [1] and [3] are identical and must have a relationship, while [3] and [4] do not have a direct contradictory relationship as per % relation but aren't guaranteed to directly follow as in * or # relation. Hence [3] and [4], when strictly queried for direct \"agreeing\" or \"disagreeing\" relationship, skew towards being separate, indicated by [B]."}

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, SAP is false as it directly contravenes SEP.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific truth-values based on provided relationships and the direct negation/intent of universal and particular propositions' implications:\n\n[[true];[false];[false];[false]]\n\nThis conclusion adheres to the given rules and logical forms specified."}

However, the answer in the required format [[number]] that directly corresponds to the inference resulting from the given statement to its consequence is best summarized by the fact that the transformation from !$!p to $p outlines the property of necessity to possibility transformation, fundamentally encapsulated in the logical structure supportive of inference (9): #p \u2192 $p. Yet because the question asks for it in a specific context of negation leading to possibility directly from a given list, recognizing !$!p \u2192 $p (formula 8) as preparatory to applying (9)'s essence, [[9]] succinctly represents the core inference pathway respecting the initial to final modal transition as articulated in the rules."}

Specifically, \"It is not true that Xiao Lin will never win\" can be understood as a negation that overcomes the never, thus leaving us with a positive statement about the future - \"Xiao Lin will win\". Since we're dealing with the negation structure, in terms of time relations, this takes the form of \"\u00acG\u00acp\", which by formula (16) is equivalent to \"Fp\".\n\nTherefore, for the first pair, we're dealing with \"Fp\" and \"Fp\", which, however, was not directly included in the given relationships but follows the logic implied by relationship (3) \u26ad, as it states that \"Fp and F\u00acp cannot both be false.\" The direct application here can be tricky, as it implies a self-relation that is true by the \u26ad rule, meaning it can both be true.\n\n(2) For \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\", we denote this as \"Gp\", a future period statement.\nFor \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\", which is more about a future point in time, we denote this as \"Fp\".\n\nLooking at the relationships defined:\n- The pair \"Gp and Fp\" fits the description of the fourth relationship (4) \u2042 which allows both statements to either be true or false simultaneously.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1) The first pair (Fp \u2194 Fp) falls under the \u26ad Relationship as they can both be true (as per (3)).\n(2) The second pair (Gp \u2194 Fp) fits the \u2042 Relationship as per rule (4).\n\nFinal Answer: [[C];[D]]"}

Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the information and the logical model provided, we can derive the logical expression based on the axiom of reflexivity.\n\nSince Alice is sure that the library is open today, represented by the proposition `p`, and Alice is also sure of her belief (`B_p`), the axiom of reflexivity tells us that if `B_p` holds, then `BB_p` also holds. Therefore, the logical expression for Alice being sure that the library is open today and sure of her belief can be written as:\n\n```\n[ B_p \u2227 BB_p ]\n```"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The passage describes a scenario where the increase in the number of deep wells and the amount of underground water usage correspond to an increase in ground subsidence. This scenario closely matches **Method \u2d63**, in which changes in S (the number of deep wells and underground water usage) are observed to correspond to changes in P (the amount of ground subsidence).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[D]]."}

Their reasoning was as follows: On land, there is air and sunlight, and most organisms rely on these resources for growth and reproduction; in the deep sea, there is a lack of sunlight, extreme pressure, and low temperatures, and most terrestrial organisms cannot survive in such extreme environments.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA. \u03a8 Method             B. \u2318 Method\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The reasoning in the question follows the \u2318 Method. The core of the reasoning is that since the terrestrial organisms rely on attributes a, b, and c (air and sunlight), and the deep sea lacks these attributes, terrestrial organisms (that require a, b, and c) cannot survive in the deep sea (context where -a, -b, -c). By extension, many attributes of terrestrial life sustainability do not hold in the deep sea environment, following the logical pattern of the \u2318 Method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

The straightforward nature of the original statement and its inference doesn't directly suggest complex or marked expression use.\n\nBased on the provided principles and given sentence, this seems not to conform directly to any of the principles as specified in a clear manner. However, the question appears to expect a categorization. Given that the minimalization criterion could suggest a slight relationship with C% due to the statement involving the minimal information \"the beer is warm,\" but ultimately expanding the definition of what \"food\" is, the closest alignment would be with the principle that aims for clarity and relevancy of information conveyed rather than a direct inference jump. \n\nStill, considering options and the alignment that could loosely frame the minimal informativity of the statement, the answer should be considered in terms of the closest logical fit within provided constraints.

In the scenario described, one might infer that the \"mother\" is indeed the \"baby's mother,\" but this inference is based on the hearer's assumptions and expanded understanding beyond what is explicitly stated to infer a likely relationship rather than on the form of the sentence itself or any specific linguistic criterion related to the principle structure provided.\n\nGiven the described principles:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle focuses more on the limitation of information inferred from what is known by the speaker and not weakening information. The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate. This aligns closely with the question as the inference made assumes the least necessary meaning from the relationship described (that the woman picking up the baby is the baby's mother).\n\nTherefore, the principle most directly applicable here is the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]"}

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Sociology is a comprehensive discipline that studies social relations and social behavior to explore the conditions and laws of social coordination, development, and good functioning, providing knowledge and methods for understanding, managing, and transforming society.\"\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The provided definition for \"Sociology\" describes what sociology studies in terms of social relations, behaviors, and the conditions and laws of social coordination, development, and good functioning.

However, the specific description matches the definition more closely of the \"CondSwap Method,\" which explicitly states the erroneous belief that if P then Q, one might incorrectly conclude that if Q then P.\n\nGiven the options and the explanation, the correct answer is the CondSwap Method.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[C]]"}
