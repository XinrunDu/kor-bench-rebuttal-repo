Substitute these back into the equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i:\n\n   (9 - Y^2 + 6Yi) - (3 + 4i) = 5 + 2i\n   (9 - Y^2) + 6Yi - 3 - 4i = 5 + 2i\n   (9 - Y^2 - 3) + (6Y - 4)i = 5 + 2i\n   (6 - Y^2) + (6Y - 4)i = 5 + 2i\n\n4. From this, we separately match the real and imaginary parts:\n\n   6 - Y^2 = 5\n   6Y - 4 = 2\n\n5.

Thus, \\(\\log_{X}{2} = \\frac{1}{y}\\). Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y} + y = \\frac{5}{2}\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(2y\\) to clear the denominator, we get:\n\n\\[2 + 2y^2 = 5y\\]\n\nRearranging into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n\\[2y^2 - 5y + 2 = 0\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a=2\\), \\(b=-5\\), and \\(c=2\\):\n\n\\[y = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4*2*2}}{2*2}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\\]\n\nSo, \\(y\\) can be \\(\\frac{5 + 3}{4} = 2\\) or \\(\\frac{5 - 3}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nConverting back, \\(y = \\log_{2}{X}\\) means \\(X = 2^y\\). So, the possible values of \\(X\\) are \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\). Since \\(X\\) is asked for as a positive integer, \\(X\\) must be 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[4]]"}
