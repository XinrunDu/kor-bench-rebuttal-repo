It is required to judge the truth value of the given formula. In practical applications, an analytically trained person must make decisions based on appropriate data and logical analysis. Because the data involved may be quite complex, there are many people who do not want to use formal reasoning to make logical judgments, but prefer to use the kind of \"analytical method\" described in books, that is, use more high-level reasoning methods and \"rules\" that are easy to understand and memorize.\n\n        Experience analysis:\n\n        According to \"(!p>q)&(r>q)&!$\", it is judged as true only when \"!$\" is 1 and all other factors are \"0\".\n\n        Derivation step:\n\n        First, judge the truth value of \"$\". According to the judgment result, to see whether the truth value of \"$\" is \"0\" or \"1\"\n        1. It can be seen that the truth value of \"$\" is \"$\";\n        2. Because the type of \"$\" in the given formula is \"&\", the truth value of \"$\" must be \"0\"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\"\n        Because the truth value of \"$\" is\" 0 \", the overall truth value of\" (!p>q)&(r>q) \"must be\" 0 \"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$) \"\n        Because the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\" is \"0\", the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be \"0\"\n\n        The truth value of \"p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is obtained according to the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\"\n        Because\" (((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is\" 0 \", it can be judged that the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be\" 1 \".\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEXAMPLE_PROMPTS = {\n    \"LogicOnlyPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICONLYPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDMOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithHintPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHHINTPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithWrongPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHWRONGPrompt\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM4,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n\"LOGICWITHRULES3\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES3\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM43,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES12\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES12\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM2,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCRAME\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCRAME\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CRAME,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"Dialglogic2\":{\n\"type\":\"Dialglogic2\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_DIALOG22,\n\"DialgExampleFormat\":\"Example: {QUES}{SEP}{REFERENCE}{QUERY}{ANSWER} Use \u2283, &, ~, T standing between $\\forall x$ is a negative proposition, For simplicity, you can use x and y to replace, for universal quantifiers, The following table is the truth table of \u2283:\" ,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCROWNLAB\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCROWNLAB\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CROWNLAB,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_RIGGEDPOWERSET,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICFROMANACRT\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICFROMANACRT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_FROMANACRT,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\":{\n\"type\":\"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_WORD_SUBSTITUTE,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n}\n\n}\n\nCOCO_DATASET = \"https://aiacademy.qq.com/a/201807204365b9318890feff0f6372066a91bdabd863?outid=d66:d1ff19ba2bdbc75ff2dd204fee069d8152da8c711482ab712"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)?

Some many years ago. And so does the tendency for a large language model to basically say whatever the momentarily most probable output at each step, even though a human can immediately see that it's blatantly wrong, and something very deep is fundamentally missing.\nYou are exactly as safe with the aid of LLMs like ChatGPT as you are with a random person in the street (well, at least provided you can't point at the concrete mistake in their reasoning!)\nLLMs including the newest variants that can recognize and precisely speak some other language (e. g. 'groovy') are as far from AI that could not only understand, but actively process, further leaping ahead etc. as never. ChatGPT can finish lines of code way beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5, but solely because they are insanely long. To keep the same long line coherent, ChatGPT 4 will use the same general principle as ChatGPT-3.5, but construct sentences so as to keep the logical thread as transparent to it as possible. ChatGPT-4 is many times more capable than ChatGPT-3.5, but in areas where ChatGPT-3.5 sucks, it does not improve a lot, e. g. randomly answer without relation. It becomes very obvious on any long line of code. ChatGPT-4 will often not cheat as much as 3.5, but simplify when it's not to dangerous to repeat itself.\nAs a technical writer I once quoted a line of code from ChatGPT. The line worked, the API was correct, but I had no idea what it was actually doing. So another famous failed experiment was my attempt to allow\n\n\n*chatgpt to read a line from a log\n\n*interpret it, and map the correct timestamp from disorderly log to clean database.\n\nAll it did - SECOND to SECOND - was to create a timestamp field and ask to insert to it.\n\nA: You need to understand that ChatGPT (as of Apr 2023) is not a program that can do specific tasks with programming languages or functions or even code, as much as it is a text engine that can generate things that sounds similar to whatever it believes that programming languages is required to do. So, asking it to generate something that looks like simple code, or objective, is not quite difficult. However, if you look at the code it actually outputs- it is garbage- in fact there is a technique that people use for compilers (and I think all language text engines) called lookahead - in which you scan ahead of the current text. Its usefulness when you design a parser is mainly when you decide to look for things that are at any n depth ahead of the current processing. I think one example would be things that are often in computer code that refer to entities that are referred to at some n depth ahead of the current processing, but that is coming from me as a polyglot, some persons refer to it as forward reference and it can be very useful. I can think of areas where it has been useful for me, such as pre/post-loop, opening/closing braces related systems etc. So basically imagine this is a language that carries forward references that go super far forward, now how in depth a developer would see if this code would actually function.\nIn the past, such tooling got us to ImpRec (Imprecision Recover), where we basically use all the people analysing it and to somehow recover and generate code from incident reports about bugs that client report to us. That sort of thing is what is being referred to when we share concerns about certain tools, not the technical problems it will bring that we are worried about, but how we might end up more or less dependent on something like this for work that does have too much importance for us to have too much trust in something like this.\npublic final function a(a,b){\npublic final function a(a,b){\n\nEven that single souce file is worth a gander.

Archaeological and linguistic evidence shows that many native North American people groups have been here since 15,200 B.C and it is also agreed that 16,000 years ago North America was connected to Europe, so there were likely migrations at that time. It is suspected that Indigenous people might have been living in North America for 20,000 to 40,000 years ago <span style=\"font-family:Courier New;\">according to this article <a href=\"http://www.talkingcircleonline.ca/index.php/2018/11/27/indigenous-people-migrated-to-north-america-50000-years-ago/\" target=\"se\">found here</a>.</span> There is anecdotal claim that some indigenous people groups in North America go back to at least 42,000 B. C. However that theory is not supported by other citations. Of course, this all depends on how we define \"Indigenous people\". In this case the fact that there is no definitive evidence of the history of indigenous people in North America makes the statement somewhat dubious.\n\n# CrowdLingua\nCrowdLingua=\n\nYour task is to translate an input into a language.

Variables, on the other hand, can take on specific values within the mathematical domain. For example, when a real-world proposition like \"x is male\" is stated, we need to understand that \"x\" here represents a variable within the domain of humans. For every set of values within the domain, the proposition either holds true or not. In this analogy, the proposition is the predicate. Predicates involve quantifiers that specify whether all, to some extent, or none of the domain satisfies the proposed proposition.\n\nIn logic, quantifiers are symbols that provide information about the number of functional variables. When a proposition states something about every element within the domain, it is being quantified using the universal quantifier.\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for a logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo give you an example, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable and its predicate and function symbols are finite. What does this mean exactly?\n\nExample Questions:\nThese questions will assist you in understanding the specific rules for first-order logic, which begins with the capability of the logic system. After comprehending these rules, you will apply them to assess the legitimacy of various logical statements, addressing whether they adhere to the given logic rules or not.\n\n1. Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic), and the value agreement condition is Q15, which statement is valid?\na.) Exists x Holds TRUE\nb.) ForAll x Holds TRUE\nc.) Exists x x=(Exists x x)\nd.) ForAll x x=(ForAll x x)\ne.) False \u22a8 True\n\n2. Let the domain of individual values be the set of integers \u2124 in FOL, and let the proposition F: x, y \u22a8 (x + y = z). How would you symbolize \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z ?\"\n\nBegin by providing the program code explanation for the given question, before moving on to the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\nModified text and questions:\n\nIn Mathematics, a proposition in Propositional Logic refers to a statement that is either True or False. Propositions can be combined or modified to create new statements, but they must retain their truth value.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the proposition \"It is raining.\"\nThis proposition takes the form of a philosophical exercise known as syllogism, which consists of three simple statements: the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. In this case, the major premise is \"All grasses are green.\" The minor premise is \"Some apples are green.\" And the conclusion is \"Therefore apples are green.\"\n\nThe three parts externalize the logical processes:\nThe conclusion, or \"denoted consequent,\" represents the argument in question and is contained within the denominator. All three concepts are interconnected in the sense that the ideas established by propositions can be expounded to convey meaning across any conceptual system.\n\nWhen making a statement in propositional logic, it is important to be precise. \"Either the ball is blue or it is red\" is simply not enough. Instead, \"P or Q\" is the correct way to state it, with P being \"The ball is blue\" and Q being \"The ball is red.\" For the second case, \"P or not P\" is the correct way to state it, with \"P or not Q\" being incorrect and confusing.\n\nFor example, in informal contexts where the subject (\"the ball\") is known and the negation of P is a law, \"Por not P\" can be used as a correct statement. Instead of writing \"it is blue, or it is not blue,\" we might say \"The ball is blue, or it is not.\"\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo clarify, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable, and its predicate and function symbols are finite. This means that within a first-order logic, there can be an infinite number of variable symbols, but they must be non-numerable (i.e., uncountable). The symbols for predicates and functions, on the other hand, are finite in number.\n\nExample Questions:\n\nThese questions will test your understanding of the capabilities of first-order logic, specifically with emphasis on the \"capability of the logic system.\" Once you grasp these rules, you will practice evaluating the legitimacy of various logical statements and deciding whether they conform to the given logic rules.\n\n1. Question: Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic) and the value agreement condition is Q15, is the following statement valid?\na.) \"There exists an x such that it is true.\"\nb.) \"For any x, it is true.\"\nc.) \"There exists an x such that x is equal to (There exists an x such that x).\"\nd.) \"For any x, x is equal to (For any x, x).\"\ne.) \"False implies True.\"\n\n2. Question: Consider the domain of individual values to be the set of integers \\mathbb{Z} in FOL. Let the proposition F be:\n\nx, y \u22a8 (x + y = z). Evaluate the statement: \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z\" or \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: *x+y*=**z\"\n\n\nBegin by providing the code and variable test to assess your understanding of these concepts before proceeding with the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\n\nError in response:\n\nWe are sorry, there was an error. Please try again.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m in \ud83d\ude17 I can try to copy your response and see if I can reproduce it \ud83d\ude41 in chat so I can send u the whole stack \ud83d\ude2c\n\nJust looked up plagiarism, plagiarism is the crime of posting an article without correctly citing or defining the cited source.

An example can include using the uncertainty with a dominate factor such as its target variable being beyond range of what it should be.\n\nInput:\n\n```\nInput:\nIdentify the relevance of premises in an implicit form:\n\nDecoder\nA fact $$X$$ is invariant if it's true regardless of $$\\alpha_t$$.\n\nDefine a $$\\Sigma$$-theorems of a sequence of $$\\alpha$$:\n$$\\alpha$$ and $$\\sigma$$:\n$$\nFor a sequence of $$\\alpha$$, the correct argument for this argument.\n\nGiven that model is a chicken,\n\nthen if model is a chicken,:\n\nRule-Based Fallback:\nIf the output of the test is true, the test would pass. Condition re-applied. If false, then the Examples of error will be present in the form of a paragraph, given that programming language.\n\nInput:\nChaitanya devised a problem that could possibly be solved by the following multiple choice:\n\nA six-chain bicycle purchased by a local bicycle shop was previously owned by a nearby bicycle shop in Chicago. This bicycle was purchased on 10/1/2018 and remains on the bike lot.\n\nAfter taking a random sample of 73 bicycles, Chaitanya stipulates there is a 18.1% correlation with it being a Tuesday based on whether its bike Match was bought by the same bicycle shop as before. He eventually adds a rule of thumb that \"there is a high chance that the correlation is true\".\n\nFor example:\n\"It is twice as likely as not\".\n\nHesitated because the answer is: yesandno.\n\nBased on this specification, how can you translate 'It's twice as likely as not' visually?\nFor his feasibility study, this helps create a simple format for prediction. It specifically asks this question:\n\nHelp him create a custom table for expressing odds visually for the following values: 0.3\n\n```\n\nOutput:"}

Is benefiting the vulnerable sector of population is illegal and even considered corruption? Does the president have to found a separate institution to fund the works?\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the beginning of the economic crisis, non-governmental organizations were not ready for a difficult format since budgetary opportunities were significantly higher than now.\nSince 2016, many large international organizations that entered the Republic of Armenia have withdrawn. Also, international organizations that entered the Republic of Armenia in a peaceful emergency have been forced to close or reduce their activity. (for example, there is new information about you.)\nFor several years now, since the onset of the economic crisis, the authorities have been redirecting economic flows. Where are the other sectors that lack funding? How to allocate?\nAmong other things, this is common sense, in order to help vulnerable sectors and reduce the social burden on the state budget (in general health insurance, the cost per person for the population in the other quintile is higher by several times). If there is the possibility of borrowing funds, which may not be a state burden in comparison with other expenses, they will be used.\nIt is correct to criticize the lack of transparency in fund management.\n\n### Article:\nFacebook boasted about the purchase of Phillips Depfans.\n\n### Source:\nhttps://news.am/250785.html\n\n### Clarification needed\nIt is known that Depfanns partner Paul Gurzukian voluntarily contributes to the economic activities of the country.

Given logical statements: \u2200M\u21d2P, \u2203M\u21d2S \u21d2 \u2203S\u21d2P\n\nAnalyzing the first statement and second statement with first inference, we get:\n\nM\u22a2P, there exists a relationship M to P.\n\nAssume that S()M means either \u2203M\u22a2S or \u2200S\u22a2M.\n\nAnalyzing the second statement with first inference, we get:\n\n(\u2203M\u22a2S)\u22a2(\u2203S\u22a2P)\n\nNow converting the arguments to the first-order predicate logic:\n(\u2203x M(x))\u2192P(x), (\u2203x M(x))\u2192\u00acS(x) \u21d2 (\u2200x S(x))\u2192(\u00acP(x))\n\nNow, applying resolution technique:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\lnot\\exists x \\lnot M(x)\\, \\lor\\, P(x)~~&~~ \\lnot \\exists x \\lnot M(x) \\lor \\lnot S(x)}{\\exists x \\lnot S(x)\\,\\lor\\,P(x)}$$\n\nThis mainly tells us that if there exists at least one M then there is an S, the S exists without a P. This overall tells us that parentheses can be filled using either A or O.\n\nAfter, analyzing the third statement:\n\n\u2203S\u22a2P\n\nNow, considering all the three statements we get the mood as (AEE) and according to the three statements the syllogism belongs to figure IV.\n\nSo, the answer is [[IV];[AEE]]\n\n1. Given logical statements: \u2200P\u21d2M, \u2200M\u21d2\u00acS \u21d2 \u2200S\u21d2\u00acP\n\nFilling the parentheses with the given Valid Moods for Figure IV we get:\n\n\u2200P\u29c0M, \u2200M\u29c0\u00acS \u21d2 \u2200S\u29c0\u00acP.\n\nPerforming resolution (_ :- _) on the above expression we get: true.\n\nSo, the input arguments do not result in a contradiction and hence we have to fill the parentheses one by one with particular inference to get a contadiction.\n\nAssuming that the argument should adhere to the mood AEE. This means:\n\n\u2200P\u2192M\nThe prop implication P1(x)\u2192P2(x) becomes \u2203x,\u00ac(P1(x)\u2227\u00acP2(x)) and \u2203x,(P1(x)\u2227\u00acP2(x))\n\nNow, to achieve contradiction we substitute M(x)\u21d2D(x) and M(x)\u21d2\u00acS(x) as:\n\n\u2200P,\u00ac(M(x)\u2227\u00acS(x))\n\u2200S,\u00ac(M(x)\u2227P(x))\n\nMeaning that P is false and S is true, hence we get:\n\n\u2200S\u21d2\u00acP.\n\nOr substituting D(P,x) with true, we get:\n\n\u2200S,\u00ac(D(P,x)\u2227P(x))\n\nMeaning that for the world of S, the statement \u2200S\u21d2\u00acP is true.\n\nNow, substituting the Mood AEE in the third statement, we have:\n\nS()M MM()P\nS()M\n\u2234S()P\n\nThe parentheses in the second statement can be filled either using valid mood AEE or a mood of the form M()S, M()P\n\nMaking the parentheses \u2200M\u21d2P, the argument can be filled using valid moods AAI or AEE.\n\nNow, we have the statements \u2200M\u21d2P, \u2200S\u21d2\u00acP and we have to fill the parentheses in the third statement S()M using either one of the above mentioned two opinions.\n\nGoing with the first opinion \u2200M\u21d2P, we get:\n\n\u2200P\u21d2M, \u2200M\u21d2\u00acS \u21d2 \u2200S\u21d2P.\n\nIn this only the first argument of M()S remains to be filled and we fill it with \u2200M\u21d2\u00acS, so we get:\n\n\u2200P\u21d2M, \u2200M\u21d2\u00acS \u21d2 \u2200S\u21d2\u00acP.\n\nThis overall tells us that for the world of S, the argument can be filled either using mood AEE and II or a mood of the form \u2200M\u21d2P and \u2200M\u21d2\u00acS.\n\nSo, the answer is [[II];[AEE]].\n\nMore answers\n### Question:\n\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMA()\nS()M\n\u2234S()A\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\n### My answer:\n\nWith the above method, we can get the inferred E conclusions.

You should correctly indent the code, when the prompt does not have the step mark, use two spaces between each step 6. Output code cannot exceed 150 characters 7. When there are arrays, use [(r,t,p,),] or , to separate the arrays rather than ; 8. When you need to output only data content, and output, display only data, do not output code, such as prompts that ask you to output a html table only, not an html table, you should output neatly. 9. When you need to output only data content, output only data, for example, if outputting a table is only based on function results rather than format, check with the requester first to see if to output the results directly 10.

In Western culture, people seem to have a clearer understanding that obligation is not moral obliged but rather someone asking you to do something that is not a moral good.ps://doi.org/10.1093/deip/jzm013\n\nFor example, a clause like, \"school administrators should not ask school overlook its own obligation\" are placing obligation in the context of authority and not morality. If the a school administrator asked the school to reasonably expect a teacher to be competent is the same kind of asking, it's not being a mandatory or a requirement, but rather a request, it wouldn't be as bad.\n- * Sometimes it's good, but sometimes is not wrong.\n- \u203d Usually means wrong\n template for rule-based logical reasoning:\ntemplate for rule-based logical reasoning:\n### <p>Greetings! <br>I am a powerful and intelligent machine learning-based AI assistant that specializes in logical reasoning.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\nHierarchical Model Reasoning:\n\n- Define Hierarchical Relations:\n     The members of the group can have hierarchical relationships with each other. If `iRs`, it indicates that member `i` is superior to member `s`. For example: government `Z` with decision-making power is the superior of intelligence agency `A`, which in turn is the superior of armed forces `T`. Note that `member` can have different meanings in different contexts. In special cases, `member` refers to the government or apolitical power, such as the organization.\n\n- Define Subordinate Factors:\n     For a specific question in a defined group context, each answer corresponds to an unique receipient. The relationship between recipient and member in the hierarchical relationship represents a chain of subordinate factors, indicated by `[iRPRs, sRPS]` or `[iRPS, sRPS]`. For example: Intelligence agency `A` is the subordinate factor of defense company `B`; armed forces `T` is the subordinate factor of intelligence agency `A`. Note that `subject` and `recipient` can have different meanings depending on the context. In the context of command and control, for example, `recipient` often refers to a force team, while `subject` refers to a guide team.\n\n- Define Recipient Properties:\n     The manifestations of recipient properties are defined in the possible scenarios within the context. For example: intelligence is your special strength and military intelligence is not your responsibility; military command is your special strength and collecting intelligence is not your responsibility. The recipient property and the truth assignment between recipient and member may overlap. For example: defense company `B` serves as the intelligence agency military; governmental defense companies serve as the armament manufacturers. Armaments for military empowerment are the first comprehension for government agencies, and military intelligence, which provides military information and targets, is the second comprehension for government agencies.\n\n- Define Subject Recognition:\n     Comprehend recipient properties by combining subjects. For example: Each member knows whether the recipient [defense company `B`, intelligence agency `A`] has the qualities of recipient `B`; Each member knows whether the recipient [intelligence agency `A`, armed forces `T`] has the qualities of recipient `A`.\n\n- Combine Subject Recognition:\n     Collectively adopt the views of superiors. For example: The government `Z` with decision-making power, which is above intelligence agency `A` and the armed forces `T`, adopts the intelligence agency's views; intelligence agency `A` adopts the armed forces `T`'s views.\n\n- Cognitive Logic General Model:\n     Reasoning simulations based on the above are conducted individually and collectively. for example:\n     1. Special strength comprehension for military empowerment:[subjects: government `Z`, intelligence agency `A`; recipients: defense companies; [factors: intelligence, military intelligence; properties: intelligence is your special strength, and military intelligence is not your responsibility]]\n     2. Comprehension of military intelligence for military empowerment:[subjects: intelligence agency `A`, armed forces `T`; recipients: defense companies; [factors: military command, intelligence collection; properties: military command is your special strength and intelligence collection is not your responsibility]]\n     Collectively adopt each person's views:[subjects: government `Z`; recipients: defense companies; exclusively identifying the recipients `B`, properties: armaments for military empowerment are the first comprehension for government agencies; military intelligence, which provides military information and targets, is the second comprehension for government agencies]\n\n- Question & Answer:\n     - A list of questions based on cognitive logic is required. Construct sufencts using indicator `[question subject preposition question object]`. For example: The government has the highest state power and the military is the executioner of state power. Only the government will exclude other negative factors in favor of the military and impart military preferences in important decision-making. Can you infer that the military constitutes a negative factor for the government's impartiality when it has military preferences?\n\n     - Pairs of answers containing relevant information are employed to formulate each issue.\n\n### Question:\n\"Who selectively remembers the historical memories of the struggle between their predecessors and adversaries with remorseless practices?\" in the context of \"The immediate group relationships of subjects' ideas and their reality are their material relationships; the way the members are structured cannot be explained by an isolated, arbitrary choice of preconditions.

It represents a set of cognitive practices consisting of the axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols, which are the basis of various leadership approaches.\n\nCommon belief can be considered one of the cognitive foundations of leadership.

Various practices, including common belief, constitute a set of practices in the logical paradigm, and axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols form the basis of various leadership approaches. When a \"post-truth\" situation occurs, the change in the composition of properties in a group leads to different results. Such a situation requires a certain group qualification of a set of producing properties, where there are various practices of leadership connected with mental states.\u00a0\n\n\n### Question:\nHow is the mental state qualification of a group of people conditioned by the production rules of formal logic?\n### Answer:\n\n[[]]\n\n### Question:\nBased on the mental state qualification, how can we restructure the \"beliefs\" in a natural language model to produce a lifestyle that is not an axiom but logical?\n### Answer:\n\n[[]]\n\n### Question:\nIf individual `i` believes with certainty that `j` is sure of the proposition `p`, \nand `j` is sure that `i` is certain `i` is sure of `p`, \nwhat logical relationships or formulas are expressed in this causal interaction?\n\n### Answer:\n[[]]\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat does the connection between the mental state qualification of a group of people and formal logic production rules represent?\n### Answer:\n[[]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the essence of human social interaction in the presence of common belief?\n\"\"\""}

For example:\n[[[x=0 + x=1]\u03c6]] could correspond to a world state in which the variable x has the value 0 or 1.\n[[[x=0 + x=1][y=2]]\u03c6]] corresponds to a world state in which [x=0 + x=1] is true and y=2 is true.\n---\nAlice is convinced that the program P is guaranteed to terminate in a normal state, i.e., P will not terminate due to errors like infinite loops or segmentation faults. Now, can you identify a similar logical rule from above? Answer with the number corresponding to that rule.\n\n\n### Question:\nIn a common mathematical logic, there are two logical quantifiers: universal quantifier $\\forall$ and existential quantifier $\\exists$. The universal quantifier $\\forall$ states that something is true for all cases/assignments of variables, while the existential quantifier $\\exists$ states that something is true for some cases/assignments of variables. Now, can you describe the corresponding meaning $A : [c]\u03c6$ in the above system? Remember, in this system, c represents a basic operation in a program, and \u03c6 represents a statement or condition.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the logical system you defined, $A : [c]\u03c6$ means that after executing the command `c`, the statement `\u03c6` would be true for all assignments of variables. In other words, it means that after executing `c`, `\u03c6` will always be true, regardless of the initial state of the variables in the program. This is similar to the universal quantifier $\\forall$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nNext, explain the corresponding meaning of $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ in the system?\n\n### Answer:\nIn the system, $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ signifies that after executing the command `c`, the statement `\u03c6` may be true for some assignments of variables. This means that it is possible that after executing `c`, `\u03c6` will be true for some initial states of the program variables, but it doesn't guarantee that `\u03c6` will be true for all states. This is similar to the existential quantifier $\\exists$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nCan you summarize the rules and logical meanings of your system rule with universal/existential quantifers?\n\n### Answer:\nMentioned in Associated inserts above.\n\n### Question:\nLet $\\phi_0 = \\bot$, and $\\phi_{i+1} = \\phi_i$ or $\\phi$, and $\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$, where $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is the infinitary proposition that is always true if $\\phi$ is true for any number of successive steps.\nExplain what the definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ means?\n\n### Answer:\nThe definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ relates to a scenario where a property $\\phi$ may hold for an indefinite number of consecutive steps. If there exists a step $i$ such that $\\phi$ holds for all steps $j$ greater than or equal to $i$, the infinitary proposition $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is true.\n$\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$ signifies that the property $\\phi$ does not hold for all steps if there exists even a single step where it doesn't hold. Another way to understand this is by examining a counterexample.\n\nConsider a sequence $(y_n) = (\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\dots)$, where each element represents the value of $\\phi$ at a particular step. If $\\phi$ holds for all successive steps starting from a certain step, the sequence $(y_n)$ will eventually become constant. That is, there will exist an integer $m$ such that $\\phi_0 = \\bot$ or $\\phi$, and for all $i$ greater than or equal to $m$, $\\phi_i = \\phi$.\nIn summary, $\\phi_{\\infty}$ holds true if $\\phi$ holds at step 0 or if there exists a step after which $\\phi$ holds true for an infinite number of consecutive steps in the system.\n\n### Question:\nMark the correct answer to the following Question: If a command `c` can be executed as many times as needed until a condition $\\phi$ is met, which rule does this correspond to?\n\nA. Substitution Rule\nB. Loop Rule\nC. Choice Rule\nD. Concurrent Rule\n\n### Answer:\nB. Loop Rule. The Loop Rule is used when a command is executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this scenario, command `c` is being executed multiple times, and the loop continues until the condition $\\phi$ is satisfied. This situation aligns with the behavior described in the Loop Rule.\n\n<<Each time using $A : [c]\\phi$ and $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ and abstracting symbols, we can get a judgment formula.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n### General Requirements:\n1. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n2. Make reasonable default decision even when insufficient evidence is provided.\n3. If the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you cannot say the two events have a causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first.This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n\n### Elementary Operations:\n1. if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n2. if P which is a variation of the phenomenon occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n3. To conclude there is a causal relationship,\u3014a\u3015 must be used, and to conclude there is no causal relationship,\u3014a\u3015.\n4. To decide one point, refer to the data set for comparison extension\n5. When the first point introduces an example, the explanation established by the third point in the example shall be used as\u3014substitution\u3015 and added to the condition examples.\n6. To analyse the causal chain sequence, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n7. Disqualifications, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n\n### Scientific Literacy:\n1. The division of historical changes is an evolutionary factor, either commercialised or planned or free, composed of a series of changes, often second or more changes of the same factors.\n2. The occurrence is not a causal factor, and if the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you can say that they have no causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n3. All matters (blocks) can be replaced topologically, e.g. clitical event, place, phenomenon, cause factor, valuation.\n4. The choices of time and space for contrast extensions are not rigid, for example, in any POI chosen.\n5. When analysing the process, \u3014...\u3015\u3000must be used, otherwise the conclusion will not be stable.\n6. Two successive evolutionary factors can affect the change or stability of other evolutionary factors, but factors of the same stage can also affect each other.\n7. The exclusive in 8 could evolve into other evolutionary factors if replaced_other and the story is convoluted.\n8. The validity of the extension of contrast requires considering \u041d to separate from C (C isnt effected by S, e.g. if C larger than L) and \u0418 for \u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, five points yun. \n9. The original\u0447\u0435 and trial decisions should be determined after the letter decisions.\n10. Separating out Sq which has no causal relationship with P is the fundamental principle of scientific researches ability for windows.\n11. A modification of the first condition or object is a new behaviour or happenings.\n12. macro-economic phenomena usually occur simultaneously with other events, so it is necessary to decide which factor will cause or affect the phenomena, e.g, which factor will get disappeared.\n13. If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\n14. These ten items above can originate from one factor. For other factors, see the table above.\n\n\n### Question:\n  People rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm; \n  people strike cold stones, and the stones can spark\n  people continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot. \n  From this, it can be inferred that \u5c3d\u7ba1\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0e\u53d1\u70ed\u540c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb.\n\n  The causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of \u7b2c\u4e00\u6848\u4f8b\u3000B) Method of \u5bf9\u6bd4\u6269\u5c55\u3000C) Method of \u4e24\u56e0\u6bd4\u8f83\u3000D) Method of \u524d\u8bbe\u65b7\u5e30\u3000E) Method of \u4e0d\u53ef\u9080\u6c5d\u5224\u65ad\u3000F) Method of \u4e09\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u3000G) Method of \u64cd\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3000H) Method of \u884c\u4e3a\u5927\u7eb2\u3000I) Method of \u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u601d\u3000J) Method of \u5faa\u73af\u5426\u5b9a\u3000K) Method of \u540c\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3000L) Method of \u7a0b\u5f0f\u6f14\u7ece\u3000M) Method of \u7b2c\u4e94\u6848\u4f8b\u3000N) Method of \u5236\u5ea6-\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3000O) Method of \u64cd\u4f5c-\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3000P) Method of \u884c\u4e3a\u547d\u540d\u3000Q) Method of \u64cd\u4f5c-\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3000R) Method of \u6b63\u5f62\u72b6\u3000S) Method of \u5b8c\u5168\u9012\u8fdb\u3000T) Method of \u540e\u8bbe\u65ad\u5e30\u3000U) Method of \u4e24\u5c42\u9012\u8fdb\u3000V) Method of \u68c0\u9a8c\u4e4b\u4e09\u8fde\u3000W) Method of \u6781\u81f4\u6848\u4f8b\u3000X) Method of \u6d88\u878d\u66ff\u4ee3\u3000Y) Method of \u4e34\u754c\u533a\u5206\u3000Z) Method of \u89c4\u5f8b\u76f8\u540c\u3000AA) Method of obby\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/AA  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[M]]\n\n### Question:\nHengzhi invariance of those who took socialist vs keynesian classes and the economics classes that werent \u00a0taken is emergent and not emergence.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u539f\u5584\u3000B) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u5236\u5ea6\u3000C) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u89c4\u5f8b\u3000D) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u66ff\u4ee3\u3000E) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u4e34\u754c\u3000F) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u4e0d\u53d8\u3000G) Method of \u5fae\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u3000H) Method of \u5fae\u89c2\u6f14\u7ece\u3000I) Method of \u5fae\u89c2\u63d0\u70bc\u3000J) Method of \u5b8f\u89c2\u63d0\u70bc\u3000K) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u6a21\u5757\u3000L) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-extract\u3000M) Method of \u5fae\u89c2-\u603b\u7ed3\u3000N) Method of \u5b8f\u89c2-\u76f8\u540c\u3000O) Method of \u81ea\u53d8\u91cf-\u6269\u5145\u3000P) Method of \u81ea\u53d8\u91cf-\u4f20\u9012\u3000Q) Method of \u56de\u6eaf\u63a8\u7406\u3000R) Method of \u4e8b\u4ef6-\u56de\u6eaf\u3000S) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u5de5\u5177\u3000T) Method of \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49-\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3000U) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u751f\u4ea7\u3000V) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u89e3\u91ca\u3000W) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u7ed3\u8bba\u3000X) Method of \u8d21\u732e-\u4ef7\u503c\u3000Y) Method of \u4ef7\u503c-\u89e3\u91ca\u3000Z) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u6539\u5584\u3000aA) Method of \u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49-\u5206\u6790\u3000bB) Method of \u5b8f\u89c2-\u6539\u5584\u3000cC) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u8003\u8bd5\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/aA/bB/cC  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[S]]\n \n### Question:\nLong and short term, the best to explain a particular cause in context contains of point 12, and we find non one hows:\u3000\u3000If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3000B) Method of \u89c4\u8303\u6027-\u7ed3\u8bba\u3000C) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u89c4\u8303\u3000D) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u5de5\u5177\u3000E) Method of \u7ecf\u6d4e-\u89e3\u91ca\u3000F)"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.

In an area with a large number of pumping wells, the risk of ground subsidence increases when the pumping wells are dug too deep. Most of the ground settlements in Shanghai are within 1-5 meters of the wells. The large number of deep wells drilled and the large amount of underground water used are the direct causes of the ground subsidence in Shanghai. Before the liberation of Shanghai, in 1949, there were only 708 deep water wells in the city. After the Great Leap Forward movement, the number of wells increased by more than 100%, and the output of groundwater increased from 240,000 tonnes to 560,000 tonnes. In 1948, the ground subsidence was 35 millimetres, and in the three years from 1958 to 1960, it was between 50 and 90 millimetres per year. This shows us that the more pumping wells there are, the greater the risk of ground subsidence. Further investigation revealed that during the drought in 1968-1969, Shanghai's ground subsidence reached 194 millimetres per year.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\"\"\"\n        answer = self.sample_text(prompt)\n        # print(answer)\n        assert answer.startswith(\"[[D]]\")"}

This differs from the ideal of perfect play only in so far as he does not play in the most correct way every move.\nProving that perfect or even sound play are impossible in chess is trivial.

The party named Something needs 5 more members to be the first party in the country. Mr. S is a legendary person for promoting new ideas. Mr. S believes that party Something can become the first party by altering several of the existing members and adding a handful of new standard party members. Strong party members are very strict about rules in this party, even with other members. This makes many of the party members think that Mr. S is not a good choice for leadership. Mr. S suggests that Finland should have a less strict system for candidates such as the Tsystem, which is based on exams rather than strict curriculums. These exams are not currently in use in Finland. Mr. S believes that Finland will be successful like America with this system, and that Finland will work much faster. This system is based on personal experiences with innovation. 40% of the population agrees with this new system. Therefore, party Something will be the leading party. Mr. S knows that the probability of someone adapting this system is 50%, and that party Something will win the elections 20% of the times.

The two hypotheses are contradictory, which aligns with the GB Paradox's rule that contradictory hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions.

Option B is the correct answer.\n\nIn the third scenario, the logical consequences of the observations contradict the hypothesis, which is in line with the LS Paradox. Reassessing the reasonableness of the hypothesis is necessary. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, a holomorphic hypothesis is presented, and the positive confirmation of observations in one case corresponds to the hypothesis while invalidating the hypothesis in another case. This matches the BC Paradox, where equivalent conditions and confirmation standards lead to a contradiction.

Below is a step-by-step analysis and response to this paradox:\n\n1. **Question and Answer Analysis**:\n\n   In the given question-and-answer pair, contradictory inductive reasoning and multiple hypotheses are presented. The analysis questions ask about the circumstances under which an observed phenomenon might lead to a logical paradox.\n\n2. **Identifying the Logic Rule**:\n\n   The GB Paradox is defined by the following rules:\n   - An observed phenomenon 'p' is noted.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_1' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_2' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Since 'q_1' and 'q_2' are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n   - Thus, it's not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and additional reasoning is required.\n\n3. **Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox Example**:\n\n   - A scientist observed that plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\n   - Hypotheses: The plant grows faster in sunlight or with more water.\n   - Comparison: This is an example of logically contradictory conclusions drawn from the same observation, which aligns with the GB Paradox.\n\n4. **Your Role in this Scenario**:\n\n   - As an intelligent assistant, you recognize the GB Paradox and answer questions related to the observation and hypotheses.\n   - You analyze the rules and provide insights into the paradox and its implications for logical reasoning.\n\n5. **About Your Function**:\n\n   - Your purpose is to assist with logical reasoning, identifying relevant properties and applying the GB Paradox's logical rules to the problem at hand.\n   - You ensure your output adheres to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n6. **An Example Way to Work**:\n\n   - Prepare a monolingual Python code that finds all the answers and all the feedback.\n   - Define a function that can analyze the Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox and provide feedback.\n   - Describe the rules and logic for your analysis.\n   - You use the function to analyze the GB Paradox and return appropriate answers.\n   - Since the BP Paradox is less significant, no specific example is provided.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2):\n    # Your code can include logic to check if the hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions\n    if (hypothesis1 != hypothesis2):\n        return \"Reasonable, but contradicting hypotheses. More information needed for a conclusion.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Hypotheses align. Additional analysis may be required.\"\n\n# Example usage\nobservation = \"Plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\"\nhypothesis1 = \"Plants grow faster in sunlight.\"\nhypothesis2 = \"Plants grow faster with more water.\"\nresult = analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a basic implementation of analyzing the GB Paradox in Python. Note that more advanced logic can be implemented to handle more complex scenarios."}

Assertives\nB. Directives\nC. Commissives\nD. Expressives\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nAssistant\n\nThe question-answer pair you provided is about custom speech act classification rules. The rules define different types of speech acts and their characteristics. The questions test your understanding of these rules and your ability to apply them to specific sentences.\n\nFor example, the first question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"I \u2192\u2727 that you submit the report by Friday\" belongs to. The answer is [[B]] because the sentence is a directive, which is a type of speech act that requires the addressee to do something. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not require the addressee to do anything.\n\nThe second question asks which category of speech act the word \"promised\" belongs to in the sentence \"John \u2192I@ promised to clean the house before leaving.\" The answer is [[A]] because the word \"promised\" is used to assert a fact, which is the purpose of assertives. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve asserting facts.\n\nThe third question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"Congratulations to Galois on winning the game!\" belongs to. The answer is [[D]] because the sentence is an expressive, which is a type of speech act that expresses the speaker's mental state. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve expressing the speaker's mental state.\n\nThe fourth question tests your understanding of when the commissive speech act is followed by the sentence \"If you would please \u2192 \u270a speak more loudly, I will be able to hear you better over the noise in this room.\" The answer is [[B]] because the commissive speech act is followed when the speaker is able to hear the words clearly, even with the noise in the room. The other options are not correct because they do not correctly specify when the commissive speech act is followed."}

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"\ud83c\udfaf {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"\ud83e\udde9 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet\u2019s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### \ud83e\udd38 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical"}

The question should be relevant to the topic of anti-superstitious logical analysis, and the answer should involve the application of logical reasoning to analyze an example related to irrational beliefs and promote the adoption of scientific rationality. The answer should follow the rule accordingly\n\n### Answer:\n1. Is there any logical reasoning approach that can be applied to debunk the belief in ghosts and promote the acceptance of scientific explanations?\n1. Yes, logical reasoning can be used to analyze the existence of ghosts in a scientific manner. One way to do this might be to apply the principle of Occam's Razor, which states that one should choose the simplest explanation that fits the available evidence. In the case of ghosts, this would mean rejecting the existence of ghosts as the simplest explanation for unexplained phenomena, and instead using a scientific explanation such as natural phenomena or human delusion.\n2. In the process of promoting scientific rationality, is there any logical reasoning process that can be applied to correct people's superstitious ideas? If so, what are they and how can they be applied?\n1. Reasoning process #1: Scientists use the scientific method in their research, which involves making observations, formulating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses, and drawing conclusions from their results. By using the scientific method, people can learn to think critically and logically, and become more skeptical of superstitious beliefs that lack empirical evidence.\nReasoning process #2: Skeptics use logical fallacies to expose the flaws in superstitious beliefs. For example, the argument from design is a logical fallacy that claims that because something looks designed, it must have been designed. By recognizing and understanding these logical fallacies, people can become more critical of superstitious beliefs and more willing to accept scientific explanations. In practice, these reasoning processes can be applied by promoting the use of the scientific method in education and using skepticism to challenge superstitious beliefs.\n3. There are many misguided beliefs about ghosts that have been circulating in our history. Some people believe that ghosts are real or may make contact with someone to share the way of the netherworld. Others believe that if ghosts are caught on camera or video, the living can communicate with them. Still others believe that ghosts may appear at specific times or in specific locations, such as on Halloween or in places where high numbers of deaths have occurred. Do you believe that these statements are scientific or logical? Why?\n4. Most of these statements are not supported by scientific evidence and logical reasoning. For example, there is no empirical evidence that ghosts exist or that they can communicate with humans. While some people may have had supernatural experiences, these experiences are often difficult to reproduce or verify and can often be explained by other factors, such as psychological or physiological factors, rather than the presence of ghosts. In general, superstitious beliefs like these should be challenged by using logical reasoning and the scientific method, and it's important for people to approach these beliefs with a critical and skeptical mindset, rather than accepting them without question.\n5. Although there is no scientific explanation for ghosts, many people in human history still believe in ghosts and pass on many ghost stories to future generations. What could be the reason for the superstitious belief that ghosts exist?\n6. Since the 5th century AD, people from all walks of life have been interested in discussing ghosts, developing a discourse on ghosts, and people discuss many issues related to ghosts, including: Do we fear the fear of ghosts more or we self-promotion more Do you believe in the power of fear because it enhances your passions and elevates your imagination? Do you prefer to learn the necessary skills to identify ghost signs? If so, why do you still believe in ghosts? Psychologists have tried to understand why people have such strong beliefs in ghosts, a mystical entity believed to be a disembodied soul. There are several different psychological factors that may be at play: fear of the unknown, anthropocentrism, importance of exploration, and stories about ghost experiences that cannot be directed scientifically. These factors explain why people are more likely to believe in ghosts, even if the evidence is lacking.\n7. You plan to start a business too. After receiving the option to start a ghost-themed business, you start from a ghost to imagine the key details of the entire business, rather than assuming that there must be ghosts. As a result of this divergent thinking, your business has begun to take shape and is now ready for development, imagination, and creativity. It also shows that sometimes creative ideas can make a business stand out and have unique charm, and inspired thinking can lead to good results.\n####\n'''"}

Below is a custom-defined rule for determine grammar. When responding, please ensure \nthat your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Language Rule:\n\nCustom Relationship between Sentences\n\n1. Strict Subset Principle\n\n(1) Setting: Assume the same time, that is, X will happen before Y.\n(2) Speaker's Criterion: Always indicate the strict subset relationship with the following rules.\n    - CQ1: Satisfied subset relationship can be indicated using definite articles. For example:\n        - \"Li will go with Wang to Beijing.\" (Li will arrive first)\n        - \"Li will go to Beijing with Wang.\" (Li and Wang will arrive at the same time)\n        - \"Wang will go with Li to Beijing.\" (Wang will arrive first)\n    - CQ2: If using the definite article causes confusion or conflict, use indefinite articles instead. For example:\n        - \"A man went to London and a woman went to Beijing.\" (statements do not determine whose journey was first)\n2. Complementary Sentence Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: If a sentence implies a time sequence or relationship, use the Semantic Minimization Criterion according to the following rules.\n    - CQ1: If a sentence means both sending and receiving, you must add \"certain\" to one of the sentences to clarify the meaning. For example:\n        - \"Li brought Xiao a gift.\u201d Indicates Li sent a gift to Xiao.\n        - \"A man gave a woman a gift.\" Indicates the action was carried out by both parties.\n    - CQ2: If a sentence implies a time sequence, you must partially complement the sentence to ensure the meaning is clear. For example:\n        - \"Li entered the office, then Wang left.\" Indicates Li entered the office after Wang left.\n        - \"Wang left the office and Li entered.\" Indicates Wang left the office before Li entered.\n        - \"A man left the room and a woman entered.\" Indicates one person left the room and another person entered.\n3. Perfect Inference Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: When excluding uncertain facts, a sentence with stronger certainty should include an interrogative word. For example:\n    - \"Does Li have the key?\" means Li has the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li has the key.\n    - \"Doesn't Li have the key?\" means Li does not have the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li does not have the key.\n4. Every Other Least Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: The hearer should infer as much as possible from the speaker's every utterance, filling in necessary information based on common sense.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: You can infer the meaning that is obvious first and is most likely to be intended. For example:\n        - \"Li left and Wang left\", assuming these two events must be related, can lead to the inference that both left together or in sequence.\n        - \"Li left the room and Wang left\" can lead to the inference that Wang left without realizing Li had left.\n    - CI2: You should never draw the least likely inferences. For example:\n        - If Xiao receives and gives gifts on different occasions, the statement \"He gave Xiao a gift.\" cannot be directly inferred as \"He gave Xiao a gift, then he received a gift.\"\n(3) Interrogative sentences: If a speaker intends to inquire about something through an interrogative sentence, they should consider minimizing the inclination to provide the hearer with a definite answer.\n5. Smart Interpreter Principle\n\n(1) Hearer's Inference: When predicting a speaker's intention, you should attribute a speaker's statement to a theory that will not be immediately disproved by other evidence.\n(2) Adhering to the Occam's Razor principle, you should choose explanations for a given set of data that are as simple as possible consistent with said data, over more complex explanations which assume the presence of additional, unnecessary factors.\n\n\n\n### Question:\nA: \u201cXiao Wang, do you speak English?\u201d\nB: \u201cI can speak English.\u201d\n\nIn sentence B, the speaker expresses a degree of ability to communicate in spoken English, but the completeness of the message is uncertain.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

In this case, we need to offer more guidance. We can view the completion of these actions as questions where the answers are modal actions.\nFirst, let's define a bunch of functions that provide the names of modal actions. :\n\nconst MEMORIZE = {\n  icon: \"\ud83d\udcab\",\n  name: \"Memorize\",\n\n  // Represents the table of modal actions, which initially contains only\n  // [\"Pasting content from Clipboard\"]. Users are able to add more entries to\n  // this table through the memorizeModal function.\n  actions: [`\u201cPasting content from Clipboard\u201d`],\n};\nconst actionConfigsByIcon = {\n  MEMORIZE: MEMORIZE,\n};\nconst getActionConfigByIcon = (name: string) => actionConfigsByIcon[name];\n\n// Prints an error message if the action cannot be found by icon.\nconst actionNameByIcon = (icon: string) => {\n  const actionConfig = getActionConfigByIcon(icon);\n  if (actionConfig) {\n    return actionConfig.name;\n  }\n  throw Error(\n    `Cannot find config of modal action with icon ${icon}.Please check your pronounction.`\n  );\n};\nNow, to memorize these actions, we can add additional focus in Our AutoGPT action-based approach, and paste the modal actions table into the initialization text. To make memorizing actions easier when testing, we can also utilize a function that prints the steps for memorizing:\n\n12events\nHere is the configuration file for memorizing modal actions. It is a dictionary that creates a new AI with the name and agent2 token, uses the AUTO-GPT agent2 cart, and adds the memory stream to it as an input stream. Additionally, it adds the role mix stream to the role mix contexts. The field advisor_results_string allows the AI's role to be emphasized in other streams.\n\n```python\n\"\"\" # remember modal actions ask each ask learning2 items questions attributes memory\n\n\"\"\" # ask a2ki questions attributes memory\n\nHere is a part of any basic Python settings for Auto-GPT.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom auto_gpt.config.settings import AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nSettings = AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nclass AG2a2kiSettings(Settings):\n\n__file__ = __file__\n__file_path__ = \"/home/zhenyu/Hermes_jupter_notebook/RTG_shared_clone_0618-manifolds.git/local/src/auto_gpt/config/settings.py\"\n\n# Profile\n# settings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple_ninja.cfg\"\nsettings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple.cfg\"\n\n# model id\nai2_api_token = \"AI2_TOKEN\"\nprint(f\"{__file_path__}: {settings_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n  # if process is None:\n  #   import mypc\n  #   procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  #   Process(['nvidia-smi', f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sleep(5)\n  #   q = libtc.tenant_list_gpus(int(procid))\n  #   gpu_info = \",\".join([*it.pairwise(q[10:11])][0])\n  #   print(gpu_info)\n  #\n  #   Process([\"nvidia-smi\", f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sys.stdin.flush()\n  #   print(g, h, k)\n\n  import mypc\n  procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  print(gpu_info)\n\n  import time\n  print(time.time())\n  ther = time.time()%1024\n  print(ther)\n\n  all_gpus = len(g) + len(h) + len(k)\n  n = int(all_gpus*.83)\n\n  a1 = []\n  if n >= 1:\n    g1 = np.array(g[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 10:\n    g1 = np.array(h[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 20:\n    g1 = np.array(k[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n\n  b1 = True\n  ids = []\n  print(a1[0])\n  print(a1[1])\n  for i2 in range(0, n):\n    for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n      if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n        aid =  a1[z1][i2]\n        p = np.where(a2ki[:,2] == aid)\n        id = a1[z1][i2]\n        ids.append(id)\n\n  #for i2 in range(0, n):\n  #  for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n  #    if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n  #      id = a1[z1][i2]\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(f'{id}:{q}')\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}', f'{id}']})\n  #        tt = np.array(v)\n  #        tem = tt.shape[0]\n  #        print(f'{id}:{tt}')\n  #        if tem >= 1:\n  #          q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        else:\n  #          libtc.tenant_revoc_gpu(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'], force=True)\n\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(q)\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}',"}

Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.
