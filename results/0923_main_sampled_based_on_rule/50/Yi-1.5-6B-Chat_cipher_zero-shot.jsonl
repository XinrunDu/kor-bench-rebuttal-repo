Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\" using the given cipher rules, we follow the steps outlined in the encryption rules.\n\n1. **Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters.** Since the plaintext only has one character, \"G\", it is considered a single character block.\n\n2. **Determine the grid for the current block.** For a single-character block, the block number \\(i = 0\\). So, we calculate the grid index as \\(grid\\_index = (0 // 5) \\mod 8\\). Since \\(0 // 5 = 0\\), and \\(0 \\mod 8 = 0\\), we use the first grid for encryption.\n\n3. **Encrypt the character \"G\" using the selected grid.** Grid 0 starts with the characters:\n   ```\n   Grid0: | P | H | I | L | S | ...\n   ```\n   The character \"G\" is not in this grid, so it is treated as is and added to the encrypted block. Therefore, the encrypted block is:\n   ```\n   Encrypted block: G\n   ```\n\n4. **Connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.** Since there's only one character, no further connection is needed.\n\nThe encrypted plaintext is \"G\" itself, as \"G\" is not encrypted according to the rules.\n\nTherefore, the answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n```\n[[G]]\n```"}

Since it's not, we need to find it in the grid and move one grid to the upper left.\n   - The grid for the 0th block is the first grid in the sequence, starting with the character \"P\" at the top left. Moving one grid to the upper left from \"L\" will get us to \"P\".\n\n4. Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n\nSince \"L\" does not move to a different position during the decryption process because it's already at the top-right corner of the first grid and there is no upper-left grid to move to, the decrypted character remains \"L\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is \"L\", and encapsulated in double square brackets, it is:\n\n[[L]]"}

(Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

Pair each letter in the key with each letter in the ciphertext. Since the key is longer than the ciphertext, we will use the entire key.\n2. For each given ciphertext character \"c\", we need to find the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter paired with it. Since the key letter is \"K\", we mark the choice as \"MN\" (from the cipher alphabets table).\n3. Next, find the position of \"S\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\". \"S\" is the 19th letter in the standard alphabet, which corresponds to the 19th letter in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet.\n4. Reduce the position of \"S\" in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet to the plaintext letter using the same position in the standard alphabet. The letter at position 19 in the standard alphabet is \"T\".\n5. Repeat the process for \"N\". The letter at position 13 in the standard alphabet is \"N\", which corresponds to the 13th letter in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet.\n\nDecryption:\n- For \"S\", using \"MN\" as the cipher alphabet (since the key letter is \"K\"):\n  - Position of \"S\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\" is 19, which corresponds to \"T\" in the standard alphabet.\n- For \"N\", using \"MN\" as the cipher alphabet (since the key letter is \"K\"):\n  - Position of \"N\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\" is 13, which corresponds to \"N\" in the standard alphabet.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is \"TN\".\n\n### Answer:\n[[TN]]"}

Clean up the plaintext: Remove spaces and non-alphabetic characters, remove the letter Q, and convert all letters to uppercase. The plaintext \"AV\" is already in uppercase and contains no spaces or non-alphabetic characters, so it remains \"AV\".\n\n2. Since the plaintext length is even (2 characters), no padding with \"X\" is needed.\n\n3. Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: \"AV\" remains as it is.\n\n4. For each double-letter group p1, p2 (in this case, \"AV\"), find the corresponding positions in Gird1 and Gird4, and retrieve the letters in those positions in Gird2 and Gird3 to form the encrypted double letter group.\n\n   a. In Gird1, the position of \"A\" is (4, 1), and the position of \"V\" is (4, 4).\n   b. In Gird4, the position of \"A\" is (4, 1), and the position of \"V\" is (4, 4).\n   c. In Gird2, the letter corresponding to position (4, 1) is \"H\", and the letter corresponding to position (4, 4) is \"R\".\n   d. In Gird3, the letter corresponding to position (4, 1) is \"Y\", and the letter corresponding to position (4, 4) is \"M\".\n\n5.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"EV\" and following the encryption rules, let's encrypt the text step by step.\n\n1. **Cleaning up the plaintext:** The plaintext \"EV\" is already in uppercase letters and does not have any spaces or non-alphabetic characters. No changes are needed.\n\n2. **Adjusting for odd length:** The plaintext is of odd length (2 letters), so we add a letter 'X' to make it of even length. Now, the plaintext is \"EVX\".\n\n3. **Splitting into double-letter groups:** The plaintext is already in double letters, so we directly proceed to step 4.\n\n4. **Using the Girds for encryption:**\n   - In Gird1 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'E') and Gird4 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'V'), we find the letters in the respective positions marked by arrows.\n   - In Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters corresponding to these two positions marked by arrows.\n\n   Plaintext: | **E** | **V**\n               | (1,1) | (3,2)\n               | **↑**  | **↑** \n\n   Gird1:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n   Gird2:    | E  C  H  O  A | B  D  F  G  I | J  K  L  M  N | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z |\n   Gird3:    | V  O  R  T  E | X  A  B  C  D | F  G  H  I  J | K  L  M  N  P | S  U  W  Y  Z |\n   Gird4:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n\n   - From Gird1 and Gird4, the positions of 'E' and 'V' are (1,1) and (3,2) respectively. Corresponding to these positions in Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters 'K' and 'X'.\n\n5. **Concatenating:** The encrypted double-letter group is \"KX\".\n\n6. **Final ciphertext:** The final ciphertext, after encrypting the double-letter group \"EV\", is \"KX\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[KX]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"BB\" using the specified rules, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clean up the plaintext**: Remove spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and convert all letters to uppercase. The plaintext \"BB\" is already in the correct format.\n2. **Check if the plaintext is of odd length**: It is of even length, so no need to add an \"X\".\n3. **Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups**: Since there's only one pair of letters (BB), it remains unchanged.\n4. **For each double-letter group p1, p2, in Gird1 and Gird4, find the position of the first letter and the second letter**:\n   - For \"BB\", both letters are in the same row of Gird1 (Row 1 - \"KLMNO\"), and don't have specific positions in Gird4 since they are in the corners and not relatable to one another in the described way for decryption. However, since the plaintext is already of even length and consists of the same letter, we'll use the process described for encryption, which involves using the Gird1 positions.\n5. **In Gird2 and Gird3, find the letters corresponding to these positions**: Since \"BB\" uses the same position in both Gird1 and Gird4, we'll use the positions in Gird1 for the encryption process.\n\nGiven that the keyword doesn't apply to the encryption process as per the rules provided (it's used only for the decryption keys), and we're focusing on the encryption for \"BB\", we'll use the positions in Gird1 to determine the encrypted letter pair.\n\nIn Gird1, the position of \"B\" is (2, 1). Since \"B\" is in the second column and first row, the corresponding letter is \"L\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted version of \"BB\" using Gird1's positions is \"LL\".\n\nSince \"BB\" is being encrypted as \"LL\", and we're asked for the encryption of \"BB\", the answer is \"LL\".\n\n### Answer:\n[[LL]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"IX\" using the provided rules, we will follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. **Input**: Ciphertext: \"IX\"\n2. **Preparation**: Four 5x5 grids are the same as the encryption.\n3. **Decryption Steps**:\n    - Clean up the ciphertext: \"IX\" doesn't contain spaces or non-alphabetic characters, and we don't need to add 'X' as it's already of even length.\n    - Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups: We have \"IX\", which is already a two-letter group.\n    - For the double-letter group \"IX\" of the ciphertext:\n        - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter 'I' and the second letter 'X'.\n        - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these positions.\n          - The position of 'I' in Gird2 is (0, 2).\n          - The position of 'X' in Gird1 is (4, 0).\n  \nGiven these positions, we look at the corresponding letters in the grids:\n- Gird2[0,2] (row 0, column 2) is 'A'.\n- Gird1[4,0] (row 4, column 0) is 'K'.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the process. The decryption steps as described don't directly match the grids because the positions calculated (0,2 for 'I' and 4,0 for 'X') are out of the grid's range. This indicates that the decryption process might be looking for the underlying letters rather than the specific positions within a grid that doesn't directly correspond to the ciphertext letters 'I' and 'X'.\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"IX\" and the decryption rules, the correct decryption involves finding the letters in the grids that correspond to the letters 'I' and 'X' directly. From the original grid setup, 'I' is in the second row, second column of Gird2, and 'X' is in the first row, fifth column of Gird1.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted double-letter group for \"IX\" is found by looking at these positions directly in the grids:\n- Gird2[1,1] (row 1, column 1) is 'O'.\n- Gird1[0,4] (row 0, column 4) is 'R'.\n\nThe decrypted answer for \"IX\" is \"OR\".\n\n### Answer:\n[[OR]]"}

The row numbers are (0,1,2). So, `l1_row` (L1 row number) is 2.\n     - Determine the column number of \"N\" in `grid2` (9x3). The column numbers are (0,1,2). So, `l2_col` (L2 col number) is 0.\n     - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` (3x3) from 2 and 0, which is (5,0). The corresponding number is 5.\n   - For \"#N#\":\n     - Determine the row number of \"#\" in `grid1` (3x9). There is no row \"#\" in `grid1`. We consider the row below \"N\", which is 3. So, `l1_row` (L1 row number) is 3.\n     - Determine the column number of \"N\" in `grid2` (9x3). The column number for \"N\" is (0,1,2). So, `l2_col` (L2 col number) is 1.\n     - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` (3x3) from 3 and 1, which is (6,2). The corresponding number is 6.\n\n5. **Output the triples (l1_col, num3, l2_row) of the three numbers.**\n   - For \"NNN#N#N#\":\n     - The triples are (4, 5, 0) and (0, 6, 2).\n\n6. **After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information.**\n   - The encrypted information is the concatenation of the numbers from the triples: 450062.\n\n### Answer:\n```\n[[450062]]\n```"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the ciphertext \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\" and following the decryption rules provided, we will reverse the encryption process step by step.\n\n1. **Divide the ciphertext into blocks**: The ciphertext is already divided into blocks of 16 characters.\n\n2. **Decryption Steps**:\n\n   a. Place the template with holes on the filled grid and write the 16 letters row by row from the ciphertext to fill the grid:\n\n        [['', '', '', ''],\n         ['', '', '', ''],\n         ['', '', '', ''],\n         ['', '', '', '']]\n        \n        Template positioned with holes:\n\n        ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n        ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n        ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n        ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n        \n   b. Write the ciphertext letters through the holes in the template:\n\n        [['', '', '#', 'C'],\n         ['', '', 'V', 'R'],\n         ['', '', 'A', 'V'],\n         ['', '', 'D', 'G']]\n        \n         Template rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n\n        ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n        ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n        ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n        ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n        \n   c. Continue this process until the entire grid is filled or the entire ciphertext is used:\n\n        [['', '', '', 'V'],\n         ['', '', '', 'R'],\n         ['', '', '', 'A'],\n         ['', '', '', 'D']]\n        \n         Template back to original position:\n\n        ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n        ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n        ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n        ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n        \n   d. Finally, read the contents of the grid line by line as the decrypted message:\n\n        \"VRAVDGRIVR\"\n        \n3. **Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks**: The decrypted message for this block is \"VRAVDGRIVR\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n```\n[[VRAVDGRIVR]]\n```"}

Convert the plaintext character to binary:\n   - The ASCII value of 'O' is 79.\n   - The binary representation of 79 is `0100111` (since we are using 7 bits to represent characters and the highest bit is always 0 for positive ASCII values).\n\n2. Perform XOR operation with the fixed key:\n   - The fixed key is '10101010'.\n   - XORing the binary representation of 'O' (0100111) with the fixed key (10101010) gives us:\n     ```\n     0100111\n    ⊕ 10101010\n     --------\n       1110010\n     ```\n   - So, the XOR result is the binary string '1110010'.\n\n3.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's break down the given ciphertext and the encryption/decryption process step by step, applying the decryption rules as described:\n\nGiven Ciphertext: \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\"\n\n1. **Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes:**\n   - Convert the hexadecimal string back to bytes.\n\n2. **Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise XOR operation:**\n   - The key is the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\" which we'll assume is provided as '73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 ' (but since this is a simulated scenario, we'll use the actual SHA-256 hash value for confidentiality).\n   - Each byte of the ciphertext is XORed with the corresponding byte of the key.\n\n3. **The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string:**\n   - The resulting bytes are concatenated and converted back to uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nLet's decrypt the ciphertext:\n\nGiven Ciphertext: \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\"\n\nAnd the Key (SHA-256 hash): '73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 '\n\n1. Convert Ciphertext to bytes:\n   - \"27 b873038 e2027 f85 fba0 b\" becomes [0x27, 0xb8, 0x73, 0x03, 0x8, 0xe2, 0x02, 0x7, 0xf8, 0x5, 0xfb, 0xa0, 0xb]\n\n2. Decryption using the key:\n   - For each byte of the key, XOR with the corresponding byte of ciphertext.\n   - Key bytes: [0x73, 0xef, 0x2a, 0xed, 0xda, 0xfb, 0xf0, 0xf6, 0xfa, 0xf9, 0x96, 0x74, 0xdc, 0xc2, 0x5a, 0x02, 0xfd, 0x74, 0xc2, 0x21, 0xf4, 0xc3, 0x58, 0x49, 0xe5, 0xc0, 0xfB3]\n   - Calculate the decrypted bytes:\n     - 0x27 XOR 0x73 = 0x5a\n     - 0xb8 XOR 0xef = 0x7f\n     - ...\n     - 0xb XOR 0xfB3 = 0x8b\n   - Decrypted bytes: [0x5a, 0x7f, 0x6f, 0x19, 0x1, 0x3f, 0x64, 0x28, 0x43, 0x2, 0x6d, 0x5c, 0x4c, 0x7f, 0x9b, 0x10, 0x8c, 0x1f, 0x82, 0x27, 0x65, 0x43, 0x9d, 0xdf, 0x76, 0x1f, 0xfb]\n\n3. Convert Decrypted bytes back to plaintext:\n   - Plaintext: \"ZOFQIDWXVWQCPVIQKXXZIBVNLCUCXCAQPVV\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n[[ZOFQIDWXVWQCPVIQKXXZIBVNLCUCXCAQPVV]]"}
