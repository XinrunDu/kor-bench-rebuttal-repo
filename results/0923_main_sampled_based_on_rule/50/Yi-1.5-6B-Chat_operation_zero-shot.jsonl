According to the operation rule, if 13 is a multiple of X, or X is a multiple of 13, we use the formula X/13 + 2. If neither is true, we use the formula 24.\n\nNow, let's apply the operation to the given expression:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nWe know that 28 is a multiple of 4, so we can simplify the expression to:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nNow, we apply the division operation:\n\n(X/13 + 2) = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nSolve for X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / (19 * 28)) - 2\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by 13 to solve for X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / (19 * 28)) - 2)\n\nLet's calculate the value of X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / 532) - 2)\nX = 13 * (3/532 - 1064/532)\nX = 13 * (3 - 1064) / 532\nX = 13 * (-1061) / 532\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for integer values for X, and the result we got is not an integer, it seems there was a mistake in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\nX = -1061 * 13 / 532\n\nCalculate the value of X:\n\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for an integer value for X, and the result we got is not an integer, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct the approach:\n\nWe have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems there was a mistake in the initial interpretation of the operation rule for the case when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a. According to the rule, in such cases, a※b = 24. This means that for the expression 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) to equal 3, the intermediate result (X※13) must be such that when it is multiplied by the other numbers, the final result is 3.\n\nGiven that the rule for non-multiple cases is to use 24, let's reconsider the equation:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nSince 28 is a multiple of 4, the first three terms simplify to:\n\n24 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nNow, we need to find X such that:\n\n(X※13) = 3 / 24\n(X※13) = 1 / 8\n\nGiven the operation rule for non-multiples, X※13 must equal 24 to satisfy the equation. However, this contradicts the condition we set (X※13 = 1 / 8).\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding or an error in the problem statement or the operation rule as it is currently interpreted. The operation rule as given does not produce an integer value for X when solving for the given expression to equal 3, and the rule for non-multiple cases contradicts the condition we set.\n\nGiven the current rule and the provided expression, there is no valid integer value for X that satisfies the equation 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3 based on the defined operation rule."}

This means we need to consider even numbers starting from 6 (if X is greater than 5) up to X (if X is even). \n\nIf X is not considered when it is less than 5, then the only even number to consider is 6. The average of 6 and 5 is (6+5)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5. \n\nHowever, if X is considered, then we need to consider all even numbers between 6 and X. Since the average of the numbers is given as 3, and we're considering two numbers (5 and X, assuming X is even for the average to be 3), we can set up the equation:\n\n(5 + X) / 2 = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n5 + X = 6\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives us:\n\nX = 1\n\nHowever, 1 is not even, so it does not satisfy the condition that X#5 = 3, where X is considered an even number between 5 and itself.

There seems to be a mistake in the question as given because the operation rule correctly gives us 2 as the result of 3 ￠3, and the right side of the equation is also supposed to result in 2 to satisfy the equation.

However, the process described outlines how one might approach solving for X in a more general context, using numerical methods or computational software to find the value of X that makes the equation true.\n\nPlease note, the answer provided above is based on the interpretation of the question under the assumption that the right side of the equation should indeed be 5 /2, as given. The operation rule itself does not support this interpretation, as 3 ￠3 clearly results in 2, not 5 /2, based on the operation rule provided."}
