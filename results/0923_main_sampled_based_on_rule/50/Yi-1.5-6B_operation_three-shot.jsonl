However, the task is to compute 3∞4 and 2∞5 instead of 1∞2. This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct steps to follow are:\n\n1. We can apply the rule as 32+42 = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.\n2. Apply the rule to 2∞5: 22+52=4+25=29.\n3. Use 2∞5 and 3∞4 as examples to find the answer X∞3=32.\n4. Since 32=9 can be represented as 3∞2 and then 33, we will keep using 3 as an example. By substituting h for 3, we obtain 3∞7=33∞6=39∞5, which can be abbreviated to 37.\n5. Finish by applying only Y to our current rule, and then converting it into Y∞2=2∞2+0=44.\n6. Therefore, the answer is 44.\n7. Then, solving 4∞5=20, 4∞0=20.\n8. Since 20 can be represented as 40∞0, 40∞1, 40∞2, and so on, we should choose the answer 17.\n\nOur final answers for 3∞4, 2∞5, and X∞3 will be:\n\n[[25]]\n[[29]]\n[[44]]"}
