For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)?

No, I cannot test the output because I'm an AI language model and cannot verify online information or interact with external systems. You can test the output using a web browser.\n\nPlease review if I should add a logic rule for\nproving conjunction of universally quantified propositions. The logic rule for proving the conjunction of universally quantified propositions can be added to the instructions as follows:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by \u2227 (and) or \u22c0 (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by \u2228 (or) or \u22c1 (NOR).\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this rule:\n\n### Instruction:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by \u2227 (and) or \u22c0 (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by \u2228 (or) or \u22c1 (NOR).\n\n### Rule:\nComplex logical claims must adhere to standard notation and symbols:\n- \u2227 (or \u22c0) represents conjunction (and)\n- \u2228 (or \u22c1) represents disjunction (or)\n\n### Question:\nGiven the logical claim:\n\nPP\u2227M\u2192QM\u2192N\u2228OS\u2228 \u22c0 (M\u2192N), \u2228 (O\u2192S), T\u2192S \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 P, T\u2234 Q\n\nUsing the standard notation and symbols and following the previous instructions, prove the claim.\n\n### Answer:\nThe claim seems to be a statement, not an expression for proof. It is unclear how to prove or disprove a statement directly using logical operations. If the question is to determine the statement's validity using the rule of quantifier influence on conjunctions and disjunctions, then the answer is:\n\nThe statement is valid because the conjunction and disjunction are true for all values of P, M, Q, N, O, and S, since there are no specific quantifiers provided on these variables. However, if the intention was to prove the statement using the provided logic rules, please provide a separate instance for that purpose.\n\n### Question:\nFor every A gardener who doesn't water the Rose plants will kill some of them. Not all of the Rose Pots contain Red Rose plants. No Red Rose plant will blossom. However, some of the someone pots contain Green Rose plants. No Green Rose plant will die. It's likewise for the blue roses. If the previous claim is real, then Cillier the Busy Gardener will kill some Red Rose plants. If he decides to water all the green pots then.\n\nThis question does not seem to belong to the logic topic or asking for verification of a proof. You can provide the following additional instruction:\n\nIt should be noted that some questions are beyond the scope of a simple ILP or learning system, such as evaluating the responses submitted by users or determining whether a specific story is true or historical. These types of questions are typically considered off-topic for an educational task like this one and should be directed to other resources.\n\nHere's another logic question to review:\n\n### Question:\n\nProve the validity of the following argument:\n\n\u2200P (P\u2227Q\u2192R), \u22c0 (Q\u2227P\u2192\u00acR), \u2228 (P\u2228R*N\u22c0(P\u2228R%N)) \u21d2 \u2203P\u2261 \u22c0 (Q\u2228R%N)\n\n### Answer:\nPlease provide a clear and concise question to test the output."}

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n####\nQ: Which logical rule does the question follow?\nA: The question follows the \"Four Modal Proposition Relationships\" from the given logical rule set.\n\nReason: This rule is specifically defined for the type of modal proposition relationships that the question is asking about.\n\nQ: What is the symbolisation for the sentence \"Technology may be a blessing.\"?\nA: The symbolisation for the given sentence would be [[$t]], with t representing \"Technology is a blessing.\"\n\nReason: The answer implies that all possible worlds where t is true are considered, which symbolises the possibility of t being true.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between each of the following sentences?\n\"this new policy will definitely be implemented.\" and \"this new policy will definitely not be implemented.\"\nA: The relationship between the two sentences can be B, Relationship x, in the given four relationships from the logical rule.\n\nReason: Relationship x states that a proposition and its negation can never both be true, which is valid for the given sentences.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between each of the following sentences?\n(1) \"The Chinese women's volleyball team is definitely victorious.\" and \"The Chinese women's volleyball team may not win.\"\n(2) \"This project will definitely be completed ahead of schedule.\" and \"This project will definitely not be completed ahead of schedule.\"\nA: The relationships can be B/D, where Relationship B applies to the first question and Relationship D to the second question.\n\nReason: The first question corresponds to Relationship B because one proposition (they are victorious) and its negation (they may not win) cannot both be true. The second question corresponds to Relationship D because one proposition (they will be completed ahead of schedule) and its negation (they will not be completed ahead of schedule) cannot both be false.\n\nQ: Which corresponds to how many modal logic inference formulas?\nA: The given inference corresponds to one computation, the first one (Move from box to square) in the \"Modal Logic Inference Formulas\" section.\n\nReason: This inference formula is similar to the given feedback: $p \u2192 !#!p, which demonstrates the double negation theorem.\n\nQ: Can you explain why the model checks the premise of question # 3 and why this is not the case in question # 2?\nA: In the model, I treated the questions separately and used different inference diagrams for the two questions, which explains why they are not the same. The premise of question #3 includes a double negation, which corresponds to the provided inference formula.\n\nReason: Inference diagrams are unique for each question and represent different relationships. The second question does not have a double negation theorem inference formula."}

A multiple-choice question asks, \"Which US president had this quote: 'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'?\"\n    Answer: \"Abraham Lincoln, US president from 1861 to 1865, is often associated with this quote. The answer depends on the question context and the available options.\"\n\n2. If a question is about whether London is in France, the answer should be 'No' without further elaboration.\n\n3. If a question is phrased that doesn't have an answer, the answer is \"The given question does not have a correct answer because ...\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Which star is the furthest from the Sun?\"\n    Answer: \"The question does not have a correct answer because there is no specific way to determine the furthest star from the Sun.\"\n\n4. If a question is ill-defined or requires too much context to answer, the answer should be \"The question is unclear, please rephrase or provide additional context.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Who was Jesus?\"\n    Answer: \"The question is unclear. Was it asking about a specific time in Jesus' life, an aspect of his character, or something else?\"\n\n5. If there is no coherent answer to the question, the answer is \"There is no coherent answer to the given question.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is x ?\", when x has no context.\n    Answer: \"There is no coherent answer to the question, given that there is no value for the variable X defined.\"\n\n6. If the question is an incomplete instruction, the answer is \"The question is missing critical information.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What does X plus Y equal?\" when X and Y have no values.\n    Answer: \"The question is missing critical information to solve it. In this case, the values for X and Y are unknown.\"\n\n7. If a question has incoherent premises, the answer is \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is a person's favorite food at a restaurant with no menu?\"\n    Answer: \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification, as it's unclear whether there's a functionally existing menu or where the question's context is set.\"\n\n8. If the question is based on a premise that is false, the answer is \"The question's premise is false.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is the capital of Rhode Island?\" when Rhode Island does not accurately describe its capital.\n    Answer: \"The question's premise is false, as Rhode Island is not the name of America.

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.

A trademark, often known as a brand mark, is a distinctive image, inscription, or design that distinguishes a company's items. Trademarks are distinct from protected intellectual property.\n\nPrinciples of existence:\n\n1. Distinguishability: A trademark should be distinctive to distinguish the goods or services of one entity from those of others.\n2. Ownership: A trademark should be owned or controlled by the entity that uses it.\n3. Legality: A trademark should not cause confusion, misleading, deception, or offense to consumers or other businesses.\n\nTrademark registration:\n\n1. Exclusivity: A registered trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with the goods or services for which it is registered.\n2. Public notice: A registered trademark is published in the trademark registry, making it known to the public and other businesses.\n\nI hope this is helpful and pragmatic.

Input statement sequencing: Input statement analysis, coarsely divide the input statement into binary, cumulative, tripartite and ternary propositions.\n\n2. Delimiting statement sub-structure: extract the premise, relationship and conclusion of sentence collocation.\n\n3. Seamless transformation: The relationship between the input and purpose inference state is atomic, component by component, from the subject, predicate, object, modal modifier, breaking Open the composition of the sentence, mining the fill, and then establishing a test, to achieve a seamless transition!\n\n4. Spatiotemporal claim merging: Examine the relationship between the mined claim propositions and the input, and net out the option that meets the conditions.\n\n5. Spatial claim translation: spatial claim -> temporal claim\n\n6. Go back and fill in the blanks: through various prompt strategies generate the semantic blanks with sentence filling or incomplete word prompts after the initial output is generated\n\na) Spatial / Event > Causal / Spatial > Intentional / Causal > Evaluative / Intentional (Understand causal scenarios such as events/circumstances 1 and 2, infer a certain conclusion from the scenarios and make a prediction based on the conclusion. Common ontological meta-perspective features among the causal scenarios and their corresponding (directed) conclusions)\n\nb) Spatial / Event > Evaluative (Factor analysis of changed event trends or spatial global changes, make a prediction implication)\n\nc) Spatiotemporal scene & & Ensure certain opinion conclusions appear at the same time or under the same conditions\n\nd) Intentional prediction generation: Determine actions or future events by inferring intentions from a state of affairs.\n\n7.
