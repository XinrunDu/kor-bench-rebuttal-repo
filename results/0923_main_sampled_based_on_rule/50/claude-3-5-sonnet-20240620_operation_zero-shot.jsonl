According to the rule, a◇b = a^b.\n\n2) So, 5◇2◇X = 5◇(2◇X) = 5^(2^X)\n\n3) We're told that this equals 625. So we have the equation:\n   5^(2^X) = 625\n\n4) We know that 625 = 5^4\n\n5) So, 5^(2^X) = 5^4\n\n6) For this to be true, we must have:\n   2^X = 4\n\n7) Taking the log base 2 of both sides:\n   log2(2^X) = log2(4)\n   X = 2\n\nTherefore, the value of X is 2.\n\n[[2]]"}

Then our equation becomes:\n   1/y + y = 5/2\n\n8) Multiplying both sides by y:\n   1 + y^2 = 5y/2\n\n9) Rearranging:\n   2y^2 - 5y + 2 = 0\n\n10) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n    y = (5 ± √(25 - 16)) / 4 = (5 ± 3) / 4\n\n11) The positive solution is y = 2\n\n12) Remember, y = log_2(X)\n\n13) Therefore, X = 2^2 = 4\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[4]]"}
