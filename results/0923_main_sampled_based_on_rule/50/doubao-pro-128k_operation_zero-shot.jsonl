There are three cases:\n\nCase 1: If X is a multiple of 13, then X※13 = X/13 + 2.\n\nSo the expression becomes 8※(X/13 + 2).\n\nIf 8 is a multiple of (X/13 + 2), then 8※(X/13 + 2) = 8 / (X/13 + 2) + 2.\n\nSetting this equal to 3, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8}{(X/13 + 2)} + 2&=3\\\\\n\\frac{8}{(X/13 + 2)}&=1\\\\\nX/13 + 2&=8\\\\\nX/13&=6\\\\\nX&=78\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut if we check, 78 is a multiple of 13, and 8 is not a multiple of (78/13 + 2) = 8.

Since 8 is not a multiple of 24 and 24 is not a multiple of 8, 8※24 = 24.\n\nThis does not equal 3, so this case is not valid either.\n\nAfter analyzing all the cases, we find that there is no integer value of X that satisfies the equation.

Since 3 $ 2 = 2, the equation becomes (X § 4) + 2 = 10.\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives (X § 4) = 8.\n\nIf X is less than or equal to 4, then X § 4 = 4.

According to the operation rule, 2⊕3 = 2 + 3i.\n\nNext, find the value of (1⊕X). According to the operation rule, 1⊕X = 1 + Xi.\n\nNow, we calculate (2⊕3)×(1⊕X):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(2 + 3i)×(1 + Xi)&=2×(1 + Xi)+3i×(1 + Xi)\\\\\n&=2 + 2Xi + 3i + 3Xi^2\\\\\n&=(2 - 3X) + (2X + 3)i\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe are given that (2⊕3)×(1⊕X)=−10 + 11i. So we have the following equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n2 - 3X = -10\\\\\n2X + 3 = 11\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 - 3X&=-10\\\\\n-3X&=-10 - 2\\\\\n-3X&=-12\\\\\nX&=4\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can check if this value of X satisfies the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2X + 3&=2×4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the value of X is 4.

Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na￠b=\\log_{b}{a}+\\log_{a}{b}.\na and b are positive integers.\n\n### Question:\nIf 3￠3￠X=5/2, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we find the value of 3￠3:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3￠3&=\\log_{3}{3}+\\log_{3}{3}\\\\\n&=1 + 1\\\\\n&=2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow we substitute this value into the equation 3￠3￠X = 5/2:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2￠X&=\\frac{5}{2}\\\\\n\\log_{X}{2}+\\log_{2}{X}&=\\frac{5}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet \\(t = \\log_{2}{X}\\), then \\(\\log_{X}{2}=\\frac{1}{t}\\). The equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nt + \\frac{1}{t}=\\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(2t\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n2t^2 + 2 = 5t\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n2t^2 - 5t + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n(2t - 1)(t - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\) or \\(t = 2\\).\n\nIf \\(t = \\log_{2}{X}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), then \\(X = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nIf \\(t = \\log_{2}{X}= 2\\), then \\(X = 2^2 = 4\\).\n\nHowever, the problem states that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers. So, the only valid solution is \\(X = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[4]] "}
