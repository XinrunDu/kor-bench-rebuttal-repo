We can use the change of base formula to get it in terms of common logarithms: logₐ(b) = logₓ(b) / logₓ(a) \n   * log(5/2)(2) asks \"What power do we raise 5/2 to in order to get 2?\" Let's call this power 'x': (5/2)ˣ = 2. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives us x * log₂(5/2) = 1, which means x = 1/log₂(5/2).\n\n  Unfortunately, without a calculator, we cannot simplify log₂(5/2) to a clean fraction.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** [[log₂(5/2) + 1/log₂(5/2)]] \n\n\n\n"}
