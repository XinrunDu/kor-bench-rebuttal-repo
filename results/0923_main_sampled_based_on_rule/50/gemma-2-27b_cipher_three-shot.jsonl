Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the plaintext to be encrypted and the ciphertext to be decrypted.\n2. Split the plaintext into binary groups and Triplets, and convert each binary group into a triplet.\n3. Combine the numeric strings together to form an encrypted numeric string.\n4. For any five-character English word, encode the first single letter into its corresponding serial number\n\n### Given a specific input, what will be the algorithm process for encrypting this input? Please describe.\nFor example, \"UDixon's cake is in the fire\"\n(1) Encrypted:\nPlaintext: `UDIXONSCAKEISINTHEFIRE`\n(2) Encryption:\n- Binary group fission: `U D I X O N S C A K E I S I N T H E F I R E` |`X I N T H E F I R E`\n(2) Encryption:\n- Converted into three numbers:\n    - For example, the cipher corresponding to `(U, D)` is `(5, 7,=)`, which could also be written in the form of `5, 7, 10`\n    - For example, the cipher corresponding to `(X, O)` is `(,),` which could also be written as `44, 15`.\n(3) Final ciphertext:\nCiphertext: `5,7,10 #`\n\nGiven ciphertext: `5,7,10 #`\n(1) Decryption of `5,7,10`:\n    - Number `5` can be converted to `V`, number `7` means that \"V\" becomes `U`, number `10` means that `U` does not change.\n    - Number `=''`, which means that the previous letter `U` changes to `@` and moves to the left (negative direction).\n(2) Decryption of continued ciphertext:\n    - Number `44` represents the letter `J`, and number `15` means that the letters of the previous line move to the right, `@J` becomes `JP`.\n(3) Output results:\n- `U JP`\n\n\n(3) Output the decryption result.\nPlaintext: `UJP`\n\nNote that the 0 in the decrypted ciphertext means that the letters do not move, and the 20 in the decrypted ciphertext means that the letters do not move, which can be the same as number 0.\n\nThe encryption and decryption process for: `W`\n- First encrypt `W`, and the result of the encryption is 6.\n- The first step in decryption is 6, which represents the letter `F`, and the second step is that the letter `F` does not move, so the decrypted ciphertext is `F0`.\n\n### Identify the most difficult underlying task for your model, if any, and tell us what it is.\n1. Generating all possible permutations for the input string.\n2. Conducting independent sorting of each combination based on the number of multiplications, rather than simply choosing the local optimal.\n\n### Give a detailed description of the steps you took to rectify any drawbacks in your model.\nIn order to address the issue of the model's greedy nature, the following measures were implemented:\n1. Utilize multi-threading to generate all possible permutations of the input string, resulting in independent sorting and combination of each word.\n2. Update the dictionary to ensure that optimal word combinations are selected.\n3. Provide an estimated time for the algorithm to run and implement a time limit.\n\n### Explain the limitations if any, that might be apparent based on your own evaluation of the input and output.\n1. Time Limitations:\n    - The method described in procedure 03. Consider, for example, `\"ABC -> ?,XYZ -> ?\",` if the number of variables in the equation is small, the number of solutions is small, however, when the equation is like `\"ABC = xxxxxxxxxx xyz = TTTTTT\",` you’d notice that solutions tend to converge quickly and then get stuck at a local best solution, unbounded by the order of enumeration of the next digit.Since the dependency of the letters is not fixed, the potential for a solution is high.In this case, some combination of letters like `XYZ` can make `F` solvable, creating a \"local best solution\" under the assumption that F cannot be solved at the current time.The greedy nature of the model may cause it to become stuck at a local optimal.Therefore, considering all possible letter combinations independently is an optimal way to solve this problem 500 variables \n    - help with increasing and faster convergence.\n2. Complex search space and high run time:\n    - when there are a large number of permutations and combinations involved, the search space becomes extremely large. For input with words or phrases with a slightly longer length, the run time of the algorithm may be several hours.\n    - This level of input mostly occurs when performing conversion of numbers into letters or phrases.\n\n### Please summarize your response on a high level.\nThis intelligent assistant can perform encryption and decryption operations through a specific cipher rule by following a series of precise rules and notations. The task involves input and output ranges for encryption and decryption.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,"}

But when using French, the processing is slightly different and increases the complexity.\nIn that case, when encountering the character \" du la le en et il est \" in the plaintext, remove it and leave a space indicating the previous word is still in use. When there is no space between a word and \" du la le en et il est \" the processing rule is `remove all non-letters` and `all letters in capitals`. This means that \"dutan, de la, du du etc...\" are also treated as nouns and represented by the corresponding letters in capitals.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Bonjour, ça va? D’où tu es?

In his 1904 speech, he stated \"those crafty people in Spain are opposed to us, not Germans.\" The speech was turned into an opera in 1909. In 1910 he made the first recorded journey to Antarctica, to see Antarctic glaciers. On 29 April 1912, during a month and a half war with Germany, he claimed to have been forced to fly under false colors, shortly after arriving back in the United States from his month and a half stay in Tangier, where he took its flags from a German submarine. After being taken to the fleet's headquarters in Italy, he then sailed to Tangier, another British-controlled naval base. The mission was initially successful, but the Germans soon took an active part in the attack, sending in airships to attack him, supposedly taking him and his ship back to Germany. Contrary to his orders, aviators began bombarding the Russian airfield in Seville (which was subsequently destroyed by the Allies) with a new experimental 75mm bomb called the \"Muniz bomb\". This bomb contained 400kg of a highly toxic poison, and had a 70% death rate among the entire population of the town. The bomb proved very effective in destroying the Russian airfields and was dropped over the capital buildings of Seville. Some of those attacked had already been killed or had gone underground; those who survived were killed, and as a psychological effect, the civilian population was devastated. In the Battle of Safra Mahmoud Hamoud, the commanding officer assigned Manning as his principal assistant. While commanding the air arm of the rebel army, Manning had a number of air strikes on Russian cities, as well as an Italian front. During the summer tour, he flew a Suchie artillery piece over the bridge at Anzio, using it as a self-propelled transport.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of seventeen, Manning joined the Massachusetts Military Academy, a private officer's club that was regarded as one of America's most prestigious military academies. It was run by George Washington, who later became the commander of the U.S. Army. He did not enjoy school, and spent many days and nights staying away from home, studying military books. In 1925, he decided to leave the school and join the U.S. Army Air Corps as a pilot. He later received the bulk of military training as a navigator, but rather than immediately board a ship he went into a small squadron at home. In time, he learned the intricacies of flight procedures, such as avoiding aircraft by being a one-year apprentice in a foreign military position.\n\nWhile serving in America too, he became a member of The American Legion, the first African American military group to hold formal training in the use of aircraft. In his first year of training he had been granted permission to use the Spitfire XK7567 as his personal fighter plane. While still in his first year, he took part in a fly-by-night mission in the Bermuda triangle. Manning was a Chief Wingman with the USS Spitfire, when his plane was shot down in the Bermuda Triangle. Another American had also been killed, and was reported to have sustained minor injuries and the cockpit had fallen into the water. He managed to swim to the beach but was unable to move due to his injuries and had to be lifted from the aircraft in a sling, which was attached to a rescue boat. His plane was also shot down, but he survived; he was rescued and assumed to be still alive.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Manning decided to stay on with the AAF as a pilot, and began working as a civilian flight instructor. He later applied to join the British Air Force as a pilot. He married Peggy Flaherty, the daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten (Mountbatten's private secretary). They had three children.\n\nIs this the start of what would become PTI's latest new company (after its first step to oblivion)? Not quite, but you want to know what it really means for you as an individual. The answer, Manning goes, is a lot. They no longer ask: If we keep up the same way we're doing now (or perhaps start new), will we be able to get our customers to use PTI?\n\nI'm not sure about \"too much water being kept up.\" As Dave discovered on a hot summer day, water makes you feel hot. So if your company is trying to start new, you're really overdoing it, and you may not have known.\n\nWe'd love to talk the topic of water with you. Perhaps we can get our customers not to store water; instead, make it available to their friends so they can use it in the real world too. This would be a better idea for the following reasons:\nGiven that, we've got two main goals.\nThe first one is quite simple. Let's say we give everyone a few minutes to drink or mix up their water, and ask them to fill in two containers"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Maximum number of characters per line: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with a maximum of five letters per line.\n        - For example, for the plaintext \"LIDAHELLOWORLD\", first write the first line, from left to right as LIDAH, and then write the second line, from right to left as WOLLE, and then write the third line, from left to right as ORLD, the entire content of the finished writing is expressed as follows\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then read by column, each column is read from the top down, each read a column plus a \"#\", read out the contents of the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the above written content is read as LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE# by column.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, it is written from top to bottom; if it encounters #, it switches to the next column and continues writing until the entire ciphertext has been written.\n        - For example, for the ciphertext LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE#,it is written as\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then according to the odd-numbered rows from left to right read, the even number of rows from right to left read the order of sequential reading, the final result is the decrypted plaintext.\n        - For example, for the above written content, the first line, read from left to right as LIDAH, the second line, read from right to left as ELLOW, the third line, read from left to right as ORLD, and ultimately the entire content connected, decrypted plaintext as LIDAHELLOWORLD.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MMRWZX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Please judge according to the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nInput:\nPlaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\nEncrypted character set changes: Lengthen from 6 to 7.\n\nOutput:\nCiphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nPreparation:\n7x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVXW\"\n\nRule Changes:\nEncryption Rules Change (Changes from the old encryption rules):\n1. The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship. Please provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[DDWDFDDWD]]\n\n### Question:\nPossible Problem: When inputting ciphertext, if the ciphertext does not have the same number of character parts as specified above, the key and original information are not generated in the correct format.\n\n### Instruction:\nBased on the previous questions and answers regarding the relationship between the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set. Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T"}

Convert each character to binary\n    2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - If the key is shorter than the character's binary representation, repeat the key to match the length.\n    3. Permutation: Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine binary strings: Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n    Decryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 as used for encryption, like `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Decryption Steps:\n\n    1. Split ciphertext into chunks: Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted\n\n    character.\n\n    2. Inverse permutation: Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n\n    3. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n\n    4. Convert binary to character: Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent, and then to its corresponding ASCII character\n\n    5. Combine characters: Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Example:\n\n- Plaintext: \"S\"\n- Encrypted Result: `11111001`\n- Ciphertext: \"11111011\"\n### Solve the following problems according to the instructions and examples provided (the language structure is fixed).\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n\n1.

Different from the conventional computable functions, pseudo-computable functions only need to satisfy the following four conditions.\n\n(1) It will definitely terminate.\n(2) It is allowed that the time cannot be reduced in polynomial time.\n(3) Space complexity is permitted in polynomial order.\n(4) The accuracy of the computation is relaxed by 99.99%, because the accuracy can be divided into ten levels: 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.99999%, 99.999999%, 99.9999999% and 99.99999999%, it just requires the first level of accuracy to be enough.\n\nThen, a pseudorandom algorithm that requires only pseudo-computability, and is an uncomputable function.\n\nExplanation of this algorithm, I have provided a SAT solver based on depth-first search and complete exploration, which can solve all the SAT problems that can be drawn. Let me define the following notations for all the problems that can be expressed by SAT:\n\n$$ SAT(x) = \\begin{cases} {\\text True} & {\\text when\\space x\\space can \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ {\\text False} & {\\text when\\space x\\space cannot \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\nAnd now, I will use the set of all SAT problems that can be drawn and the set of ${\\text true}$ as examples. Although it can be proved that you cannot use Depth-first search and complete exploration strategy to solve even the simplest three-variable problem, it is definitely solvable as a mathematical problem.\n\nFor example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nUnder the premise that the problem can be solved, if it is written as SAT, it can be definitely solved. No need for a proof, although I provided a set of $n$ for $DFS(Search_{Depth}=n)$ to make it unsolvable. While you can solve the problem mathematically, you will not be able to prove its solution based on a variety of SAT solvers.\n\nFor another example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B \\vee C) \\wedge (A \\vee B \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nCan also be solved by SAT expressed as. While the solution time will not be shorter, this cannot be faster than n-polynomial order to prove because of the use of greedy random sampling in the set of all SAT problems more than one to solve it but not a set of all SAT problems that can be solved.\n\nTherefore, an uncomputable function can be obtained by time complexity $O(n)$ :\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}}{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} SAT(y)} $$\n\nExplanation of its uncomputability: It is $\\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}$ in this formula that is uncomputable, which requires that it must be used as a complex function and that it cannot be reduced in polynomial order. \n\nHowever, it can be observed that its uncomputability is only due to a numerical perspective, and it satisfies neither the halting problem nor the necessary but not sufficient stopping condition of first-order logic.\n\nIn addition, it follows that the uncomputable function can be pseudo-computable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: So any function expressed in first-order logic is computable?\n\nAnswer: No, I gave an algorithm that is indeed computable but an uncomputable function through Ennumeration. If there are all enumerations of a function, then this function must be computable. So the set of all functions is uncountable and the set of all X is infinite, so is all functions.\n\n-----\n\n\nExplanation of why the set of universal computing machine code is not infinite. \n\nQuestion: Please prove it.\n\nAnswer: I will first re-describe the requirements related to universal computing machine code.\n1. Binary encoding must be allowed.\n2. The code type of the universal computing machine can be represented by one less than the bit sequence that represents all problems that can be solved after encoding.\n3. Its state complexity is much larger than the upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity, for example, the data compression program for the Kolmogorov complexity.\n4. Computable Number Standard (which is completely represented by 0, 1, and 2) is acceptable to prove and tends to a and b.\n5. The function allowed to be represented is not of polynomial type.\n6. Multi-computing, multi-algorithm and multi-state transitions are allowed to simulate through simple normalization, and since we cannot use the Turing completeness standard of the Turing machine due to the problem related to the uncomputability. \n\nTherefore, its code space size is exponential in binary, about 6000 bit, very small, in fact, it is at most a little more than $2^{16374}$ if we take a try upper bound, as for how many, let's do a mathematical analysis. There are at least a thousand computing machine languages in the world, this is the number of computing machine language core classes, well, because it includes a variety of different programming languages and assembly languages, etc., the core classes are 1000, and there are that many. \n\nAfter all, a variety of operator symbol compilation language classification, I will use the conventional traditional virtual machine as an example of certification. If you take the number of the general virtual machine bit in about 1000 core of the virtual machine, one example will give, such as the VM code is now a core of a total of 8000 bit. \n\n$UCode(N,M) = \\sum_{x=1}^{VM(N,M)} (VM\\space CODE\\space upper\\space bound : 8000) * (Algh: \\frac{1}{2^{16367} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{...}}}}} * \"\\space time\\space consumption: \\frac{M}{2^{length(M) / 2}}<2^{M-length(M)} \\space \\frac{M}{terms(M)}<2^{M-terms(M)}\"))_{Upper} $\n\nWhen defining a universal computing machine, we cannot ignore both the problem domain's upper and lower bounds and the method complexity including the approximation method based on a variety of approximate methods. In the end, defining the problem as unsolvable would be very foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable set in mathematics\n\nThere is a mathematical set above, where the first set contains at least one computable number at $Ox,Oy,...,X_n,Y_n,...,M_n$ (doubles are counted just once). And among them, there is (as a maximum limit) one non-computable $logn$ and one at least non-computable $x,y$ that can be computed as a pseudo-computable.\n\n*For example* : New double-precision floating-point format\n\nTwo-tuple: one-bit sign bit, nine-bit exponent field excluding the highest bit, and eighteen-bit fraction field $(N_m,F_n)$\n\nA particular floating-point format in which eighteen bits of the fraction field are used to represent the first two bits of the $\\beta_n$ in the following figure.\n\n$(N_m,F_n)\\space \\beta_n = \\space (N_m,1+\\frac{F_n}{2^{18}}) $\n\nSet : $(N_0, F_0), ("}

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
