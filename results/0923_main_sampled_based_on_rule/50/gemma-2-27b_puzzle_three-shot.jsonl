Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), ‚Ä¶ and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt.

When writing the coordinates, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number, and when the number of rows is equal, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number. When writing down two coordinate points, the smaller number is placed to the front.\n\n\n\n### Challenges and pitfalls:\n\n### An example of incorrect application:\n\n### Answer:\n[[A:(1,1)(1,3)\nB:(1,4)(3,4)\nC:(4,2)(4,4)\nD:(7,3)(7,6)\nE:(2,3)(5,3)\nF:(5,4)(8,7)\nG:(1,7)(5,7)\nH:(7,8)(8,6)\nI:(8,1)(8,3)\nJ:(9,6)(9,8)]]"}
