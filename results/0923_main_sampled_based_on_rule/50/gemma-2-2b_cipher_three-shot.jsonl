It is represented as a letter, specifically \"P\".\n\n2. Check if \"P\" exists in the Polybius square. If it does, use the principle of \"rows and columns to replace it\".\n\n- If O does not exist, replace with 66.\n\n3. Obtain the ciphertext: \"35\" (row and column notation)\n\n4. Process according to \"rows and columns to replace it\", and obtain \"O\".\n\n5. Conversion as necessary, answer: \"34\"\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"35\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns, and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"B\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[B]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"4533332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"KN\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[KN]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"I\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[I]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"BBO\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[BBO]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"11167724758754\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2.

Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"QQ\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[QQ]].**\n\n* Explanation of XOR Operation:\n\nXOR (exclusive Or) operation is applied to each character pair of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext. During decryption, since there may be O in the ciphertext, the corresponding XOR operation is carried out. If the plaintext contains O, perform the overall XOR operation as usual, otherwise perform the XOR operation as follows:\n\n`If XOR(c,p) = O XOR(c,p) = 66 `\n\nBe careful not to be confused. The purpose of \"rows and columns replacement\" is not only for encryption but also for decryption.\n\n**Example of XOR Operation:**\n\n ciphertext: \"45346\"\n\nplaintext: \"B\"\n\nin_pair: \"45346\" \"B\"\n\nout_pair: \"0C33133D3D3D1313 D13333363\"\n\nThe XOR operation result of \"66\" is very close to \"C\", so perform the overall OR operation instead of XOR."}

It’s very interesting that the encryption and decryption of this cipher is done in square matrices. This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n"}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Feel free to use the provided information to your advantage, and if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I hope this provides necessary input to generate meaningful answers for your AI assistant system!\n\nHi! I am your AI assistant called 'CipherBot'. It's my pleasure to assist you in finding the encrypted and decrypted answers from the given input and rules.\n\n### Encryption Rules:\n- The encryption process is designed as follows: For each letter (e.g., A) in the plaintext, the corresponding value in the reel is used as the encrypted letter. The reel contains the letters 'ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN' in this example.\n\nFor instance, if the plaintext is 'A', the expected output should be B, as the correspond input reel letter is B (A is 5 mod 26, corresponding to 26 + A = B). However, if the plaintext is 'A' (constant 10 mod 26), then the output is B (instead of Z as B in the input reel) as A matches B directly without any round-robin movement to the next reel.\n\nSimilarly, if the plaintext is 'ACDFGHJ', the encrypted output should be P, as D is directly matched with P (first input reel alphabet) while H matches B.\n\n### De-Encryption Rules\nThe de-encryption process as follows: for each letter (J) in the ciphertext, the correspond input reel letter is used to de-encrypt the letter.\n\nFor instance, if the ciphertext is 'J', the expected output should be I (via subtracting 7 from 14 mod 26 as J in the input ciphertext is 14), as I is the corresponding letter when deducting 7 from 26 (as the code specifies reel numbers as mod 26 mod inherit).\n\n### Sample Answers:\n\n- \"A\" --> \"B\" (via removing the letters ones spots apart from the last from the first reel and using those spots as the plaintext's answer.)\n- \"J\" --> \"I\" (via subtracting the 7th reel alphabet (i.e., Z) from the plaintext's answer.\n- \"U\" --> \"X\" (this move does not affect the plaintext; B is moved from the beginning of the Reel to the end; thus, U is in the plaintext.\n- \"S\" --> \"X\" (the Y and Z spots interchange; we move P to fit the Z spot's position, the Z is in the plaintext)\n- \"X\" --> \"S\" (due to the ciphertext in order (A and all uppercase letters are already converted) the answer is backward, but unchanged; likewise the ciphertext is in order; so the answer is S)\n\nRemember, encryption requires the proper alphabet order, while decryption does not.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"N\" --> \"M\"\n\nAnswer: Here's a rule:\n\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'N' --> 'B'\n- 'M' --> 'C'\n- So, the answer is 'MC'.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"U\" --> \"X\"\n\nAnswer:\n\n    Here's a rule:\n\n    - Plaintext: \"VAWC\"\n    - Output: \"SCUX\"\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'U' --> 'C'\n- 'W' --> 'D'\n- 'C' --> 'C'\n- 'A' --> 'X'\n- 'V' --> 'W'\n- 'O' --> 'C'\n- 'B' --> 'D'\n- 'D' --> 'U'\n- 'N' --> 'D'\n- 'J' --> 'Z'\n- 'Z' --> 'O'\n- 'U' --> 'R'\n- Finally, 'X' --> 'SCUX' (for 'U' --> 'X') which results in 'SCIWX'.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Then, we will use the '.-/-...-' pattern to combine three letters into one pair of characters, and then use these pairs to represent the corresponding Morse code by converting them into numeric string form using the numerical-index mapping table. Finally, this string is added to the end of the ciphertext for encryption.\n\nFor decryption, we first need to split the Morse code into pairs representing each character and convert these pairs to numeric strings using the numerical index mapping table. Then, we use the morse_code Table to convert this numeric string back to the character form and finally concatenate it together.\n\nDuring the process, it is important to ensure that the output strings are formatted according to the specified instructions. For example, the encryption step should be \\'.-/-...'\\' separated by /, etc.\n\n![Here another image]\n"}

For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"BX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - M Z S D P\n        K N F L Q\n        G A O X U\n        W R Y V C\n        B T E H I\n        - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n        - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n        - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n        - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n        - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n    \n    Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n    \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n        - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n        - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n        - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n        - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n    - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"CU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
