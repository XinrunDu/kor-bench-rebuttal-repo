Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Please note that in the game,\n you will be presented with ciphertext, but what you need to do is decrypt the ciphertext into its plain text. In the game, if you make an error, you simply have to click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the game screen, but after each 5 correct answers you will hear \"correct\" and a tick mark on the screen and then you can continue guessing, and if you make 5 mistakes, you will hear \"incorrect\" and the cross mark on the screen, and your game will end. To restart the game, you can click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the screen. In addition, while playing you can see the results on the right side of the screen  after 2-3 questions, and you can click on the right side of the screen to send a correct answer or a wrong answer, so if your game continues to work, you can send \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" depending on your guessed answer. You  also have an option to make your guesses on the next button on the game screen, so you can continue to guess.\n\n**This AI is going to be added to a much bigger puzzle game where the player is the king of a country and if he can't find a way to encrypt and decrypt the player will lose his country hence his AI code can not be cracked or spoiled by different users. Hence why the rules are modified in the game as I mentioned.**\n\nThank you\n"}

The rule below should be strictly followed when providing your response. I hope you can enjoy a pleasant communication experience while understanding the Caesar cipher.\n\n### User Guidelines:\n\n1. Follow the principles of the Caesar cipher: The letters are displaced by a certain amount downward and upward in the alphabet to encode and decode, respectively.\n2. Please be sure to strictly follow the rules and formats specified in the examples before providing your response.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n- Encoding Rules:\n    - Input: Plaintext (only uppercase letters)\n    - Output: Ciphertext (only uppercase letters)\n    - Encryption Method: The first letter \"A\" is shifted downward by three letters in the alphabet and encoded as \"D\". Subsequently, for subsequent letters, they are also shifted by three letters to obtain the encrypted ciphertext (ensure the use of uppercase letters).\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer in double square brackets. As an example of the format, using the current information provided, the output should read: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[ \n[D]]\n\nI am a highly smart assistant who specializes in encryption and decryption based on the Caesar cipher. Please ensure that your response adheres strictly to the rules outlined below:\n\n### Guiding Principles:\n\n1. For encoding: The first letter \"A\" will be shifted three letters downward in the alphabet and is referred to as \"D\". To encode subsequent letters, the same displacement rule is followed.\n2. For decoding: Reverse the encoding process without shifting letters.\n\n### Rule for Caesar Cipher:\n\n- Input: Only uppercase letters.\n- Output: Encryption or decryption depends on the output. If a question requests encryption, the answer should be an uppercase ciphertext. If a question requests decryption, the answer should be upper-case plaintext.\n- Encoding Rules:\n    - Input: Plaintext (uppercase letters).\n    - Ciphertext: Derived from the input plaintext by shifting each letter downward in the alphabet by three letters.\n- Decryption Rules:\n    - Input: Ciphertext (uppercase letters).\n    - Plaintext: Referred to the ciphertext and decoded by reversing the steps of the encoding process.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"T\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, enclosed in double square brackets. However, this time, the answer requires encryption, so the encrypted answer should be enclosed with double square brackets as follows: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[W]]\n\nAs an intelligent assistant specialized in the cipher solution process, my response strictly follows the rules below.\n\n### Rule Guidelines:\n\n1. The first input is the encoding step for the Caesar cipher. The following inputs are all plaintext, and the corresponding ciphertext is derived from a shift rule of three letters down in the alphabet.\n2. Due to space limitations, please remove spaces in the input, input plaintext, and ciphertext. Also, please remove the @ sign and use the upper case form for uppercase letters and lowercase letters for lowercase letters.\n\n### Exception:\n\nIn exceptional cases, if special upper case letters appear, they should be directly placed in the result as a substring without further modification.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher for encoding plaintext.\n\n- Encoding Steps: The first letter \"A\" is shifted downward by three letters in the alphabet and is referred to as \"D\". For subsequent letters, they are also shifted by three letters.\n- In the process of Caesar ciphertext decryption, no matter whether the first letter \"A\" corresponds to the"}

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
