Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the problem, we need to evaluate whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or Neither. We'll do this by analyzing the truth assignments for each formula.\n\n**(1) Formula: p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)**\n\n- Evaluate possible assignments for p1:\n  - If p1 is true (\u2713), then p1||p2||p3 is also true, regardless of the values of p2 or p3. Therefore, the whole formula \u2713=::>\u2713 is true.\n  - If p1 is false (x), p1||p2||p3 can still be true if either p2 or p3 is true. In this case, the implication x=::>\u2713 is true.\n  - If p1 is false (x) and p1||p2||p3 is also false (x), then x=::>x is true.\n\nTherefore, p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is true under all assignments, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n**(2) Formula: (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2**\n\n- Simplify (p1=::>~p1):\n  - p1=::>~p1 is false only when p1 is true (\u2713) and ~p1 is false (x). This scenario is not possible because if p1 is true, then ~p1 is false by definition, and this makes \u2713=::>x false.\n\n- Consider the outer implication:\n  - The only false assignment of an implication is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true. \n  - From the above simplification, (p1=::>~p1) is a truth value corresponding to a false formula (contained within a truth formula structure).\n\nEvaluate assignments:\n  - Essentially, (p1=::>~p1) gives true only in one form, making all subsequent evaluations match the if-then input (i.e., never false in conjunction with ~p2 being false).\n\nGiven multiple tests of the structure will change depending on outcomes, this is, therefore, neither always true nor always false.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFormula (1) is a Truth Formula.\nFormula (2) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\nThus, the answer is \\[[A];[C]\\]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether each formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we need to analyze the truth assignments for each:\n\n1. **Formula (1): ~(p1=::>p2)&p2**\n\n   - First, recall that \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is false only when \\( p1 \\) is true (\u2713) and \\( p2 \\) is false (x). Otherwise, it is true.\n   - Therefore, \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is false.\n   - The overall formula \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is true when:\n     - \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is also true.\n     - This implies \\( p1 \\) must be true and \\( p2 \\) is both true and false, which is impossible.\n   - Hence, \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false under all assignments.\n\n2. **Formula (2): (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)**\n\n   - Analyzing when \\( (p1&p3) \\) and \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) are equal:\n     - They are true when both are simultaneously true or both are false.\n     - \\( (p1&p3) \\) is true only if both \\( p1 \\) and \\( p3 \\) are true.\n     - \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) is true only if both \\( p1 \\) and \\( p2 \\) are false.\n     - It's impossible for both to be true simultaneously.\n     - \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is true when:\n       - Both are false. This occurs when \\( p1 \\) is false or \\( p3 \\) is false, and \\( p1 \\) or \\( p2 \\) is true.\n       - \\( p1 \\) must be false to satisfy both being false (since \\( ~p1 \\) must be true).\n   - Therefore, the formula can be falsified (e.g., \\( p1 = \u2713, p2 = \u2713, p3 = \u2713 \\)).\n   - Thus, it is not true under all assignments and neither false under all assignments.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n\\[\\[B\\];[C]\\]"}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this, we need to analyze the disjunctive normal form of the given expression: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Propositional Variables and Negations:**\n   - The variables involved are \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\).\n   - The expression uses both negations and conjunctions.\n\n2. **Expand into Disjunctive Normal Form:**\n   - The given expression is already in disjunctive form: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\).\n\n3. **Analyze Each Conjunctive Term:**\n   - **First term:** \\(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r\\)\n     - True assignment: \\(\\{p = 0, q = 0, r = 1\\}\\)\n     - Binary: \\(001\\), corresponding to decimal \\(1\\), hexadecimal \\(1\\).\n     - Denoted as \\(m1\\).\n\n   - **Second term:** \\(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r\\)\n     - True assignment: \\(\\{p = 0, q = 1, r = 1\\}\\)\n     - Binary: \\(011\\), corresponding to decimal \\(3\\), hexadecimal \\(3\\).\n     - Denoted as \\(m3\\).\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Paired conjunctive terms are \\(m1\\) and \\(m3\\).\n\n### Final Notation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{[[paired conjunctive terms: \\(m1, m3\\)]; [denoted: \\((\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)\\)]]}\n\\]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nThere are two types of analogical reasoning:\n\n1. \u03a8 Method:\n    Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n    Object B has attributes a, b, c;\n    Therefore, Object B also has attribute d.\n    Here, attributes a, b, c are referred to as #\u03a8 attributes, and d is referred to as the +\u03a8 attribute.\n    \n2. \u2318 Method: \n    Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n    Object B does not have attributes a, b, c;\n    Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d.\n    Here, attributes a, b, c are referred to as -\u2318 attributes, and d is referred to as the +\u2318 attribute.\n\n### Question:\nH University can reach a new level after reform. Since F University is an old school with strong faculty and a good school spirit, it has reached a new level after reform; and H University is also an old school with strong faculty and a good school spirit as well, the basic conditions of the two schools are the same.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA. \u03a8 Method             B. \u2318 Method\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The argument follows the \u03a8 Method. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Object A (F University) has attributes: old school, strong faculty, good school spirit, reached a new level.\n- Object B (H University) has attributes: old school, strong faculty, good school spirit.\n\nThe attributes \"old school,\" \"strong faculty,\" and \"good school spirit\" correspond to #\u03a8 attributes. The attribute \"reached a new level\" corresponds to the +\u03a8 attribute.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning suggests that H University (Object B) will also have the +\u03a8 attribute, \"reached a new level.\"\n\nThus, the argument uses the \u03a8 Method.\n\n[[A]]"}

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm\" does not provide enough context about information strength or contrasting sets for inference as described in the CQ1 or CQ2 patterns.\n\n- **C% Principle (Minimalization of Expression):** This principle involves speaking minimally and relies on conventional relationships and expanding information from minimal speech. The statement about the beer being part of the food in the food box seems to relate to conventional associations\u2014food items often include beverages in a \"food box.\"\n\n- **C! Principle (Avoidance of Unmarked Expressions):** This principle focuses on not using lengthy or marked expressions unnecessarily. The given statement doesn't involve lengthy or complex language; it's straightforward.\n\nSince the statement likely reflects conventional associations (beer as part of food in a conventional context such as a picnic or meal), it aligns best with the minimalistic convention of the C% Principle.\n\nThe answer is: [[B]]"}

This scenario does not involve contrasting statements or stronger/ weaker information bracketing.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: Prioritizes minimalism in communication and relies on pragmatic conventions unless evidence suggests otherwise. The minimal statement \"the mother\" is taken to mean the baby's mother based on conventional understanding.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Concerns the use of marked expressions. The phrase \"the mother\" is unmarked and conventional, not fitting this criterion.\n\nThe scenario best fits the **C% Principle** given the minimal and conventional nature of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[B]]."}

(Common sense inference type)\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle the inference conforms to, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. This implies a specific context where a nurse is receiving the flowers.\n- Common sense inference: nurses are commonly known to be female, leading to the inference that Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\n\nApplying the principles:\n\n- **C***: This principle involves making statements as strong as the knowledge allows and making inferences about the speaker's knowledge. The inference about the nurse being female is based on common stereotypes rather than a specific knowledge-driven weaker statement versus stronger statement pairing.\n  \n- **C%**: This principle focuses on saying the minimum necessary and conventional assumptions. The inference relies on a conventional societal stereotype (that a nurse is likely female), aligning closely with CI1, which assumes conventional relationships unless there's evidence otherwise. Therefore, it follows the convention of female nurses.\n  \n- **C!**: This concerns avoiding obscure expressions and using conventional associations. In this case, the inference doesn't involve avoiding marked expressions or unconventional associations.\n\nBased on the detailed reasoning, the inference primarily involves the conventional assumption under **C% Principle**.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]]."}
