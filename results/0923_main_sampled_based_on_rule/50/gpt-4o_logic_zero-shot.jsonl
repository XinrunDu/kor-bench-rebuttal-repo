Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that (p1=::>(p1||p2))&((p1&p2)=::>p1) is a Truth Formula, determine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\n(2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the formula \\((p1=::>(p1||p2))&((p1&p2)=::>p1)\\) is a Truth Formula, each component must also be a Truth Formula for the compound to be true under all assignments.\n\nLet's analyze each sub-question:\n\n(1) **\\(p1=::>(p1||p2)\\)**:\n\nIn all possible truth assignments:\n- If \\(p1\\) is true, \\(p1||p2\\) is true regardless of \\(p2\\) (since \\(p1||p2\\) will be true if \\(p1\\) is true), thus the implication is true.\n- If \\(p1\\) is false, the implication \\(p1=::>(p1||p2)\\) is trivially true (false implies anything).\n\nHence, \\(p1=::>(p1||p2)\\) is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) **\\((p1&p2)=::>p1\\)**:\n\nIn all possible truth assignments:\n- If \\(p1&p2\\) is true, \\(p1\\) must be true, making the implication true.\n- If \\(p1&p2\\) is false, the implication is trivially true (false implies anything).\n\nHence, \\((p1&p2)=::>p1\\) is a Truth Formula.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[A]]\n\\]"}

Translate the given statements:\n   - \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" translates to \u00a7p.\n   - \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" translates to \u00ac\u203dp.\n\n2. Identify the relevant formulas:\n   - From \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" (\u00a7p), we need to find the formula that leads to \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" (\u00ac\u203dp).\n   - From \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" (\u00ac\u203dp), we need to find the formula that leads to \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" (\u00a7p).\n\n3. Apply the normative reasoning formulas:\n   - From the formula list, we find:\n     - (3) \u00a7p\u2190\u2192\u00ac\u203dp\n   - This shows that \u00a7p (allowed) and \u00ac\u203dp (not prevented) are bidirectional, meaning they imply each other.\n\nThis corresponds to the following normative reasoning formula:\n\n\u00a7p \u2190\u2192 \u00ac\u203dp (formula 3).\n\nThus, these statements correlate with 1 normative reasoning formula.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r)? How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Answer:\n[[paired conjunctive terms: (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r), (\u00acp\u2227q\u2227r)]; [denoted: M2, M6]]\n\n### Explanation:\n1.

According to the given logical rules, we must check the relationships defined for \\(Fp\\) and other related propositions.\n\n- The relationship for \\(Fp\\) and another \\(Fp\\) falls under the self-evident truth (since both mean the same thing). Therefore, they are not strictly part of the contradictory pairs but imply mutual truth.\n\nSo, for the first pair represented by \\(Fp\\) and \\(Fp\\), none of the specified relationships (\u203b, \u21a6, \u26ad, \u2042) strictly fit as defined by the rules. However, for the sake of this logical structure, they could be seen as mutual truth, falling closer to possibly \u2042 or another nuanced interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Second Pair:**\n1. \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" \n   - This can imply a future period decision, so let\u2019s denote this as \\(Gp\\).\n\n2. \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\" \n   - This indicates a future point decision, so we can denote as \\(Fp\\).\n\nInvestigating relationships between \\(Gp (future period)\\) and \\(Fp (future point)\\):\n\n- According to relationship definitions: Gp and Fp can both be true or false, which fits the \u2042 relationship.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the relationships should be:\n\nFirst pair: [[No clear relationship from given types]]\nSecond pair: [\u2042]\n\nHowever, given a structured format is desired, simplifying (where the first analysis may default to broadly inactive or trivial):\n\n### Answer:\n[[Other];[D]]\n\nWhere the first, not fitting precisely, could be noted as \"Other\" and the second as per \u2042 (compatible truth range)."}

This implies that $\\phi$ is eventually and necessarily true after some finite number of iterations of `c`.\n\nIn dynamic logic, this belief can be captured by stating that `c*` will eventually lead to `\u03c6` via execution of `c` repeatedly until `\u03c6` occurs, and is typically expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\langle c* \\rangle \\phi \\]\n\nThis expression states that it is possible through some execution sequence of `c` (potentially many iterations) that $\\phi$ will eventually be true.\n\nCombining the two forms, Alice\u2019s belief that the loop `c*` will ensure that proposition `\u03c6` is true could more simply be stated as:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\\phi \\equiv  \u03c6 \\vee [ c ][ c* ]\\phi  \\]\n\nGiven that we need minimal expressions, the simplest representation of Alice's belief, when interpreted as a necessity under repeated execution, can be given directly by:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\u03c6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will continue to execute until the proposition `\u03c6` is true should be represented as follows:\n\n\\[ [ [ c* ] \u03c6 ] \\]"}

All-even formula:** A is an all-even formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. In this case, the only term is m0, which is even. So, it is an all-even formula.\n- **E. All-odd formula:** A is an all-odd formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd. Here, the term m0 has an even index, so it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nThe true assignments point to the selections: C and D.\n\n### Answer:\n[[CD]]"}

Indirect Argumentation Methods\n\n- Contra- Method: Indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one. For example, proving the necessity of improving scientific and cultural levels by negating the contrary proposition that \"party and government leaders do not need to improve their scientific and cultural levels.\"\n- Elim- Method: Indirectly determining the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities related to the original proposition as false. For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\n\"How to deal with the enemy's huge apparatus?

Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nIf Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast, then he will spend a long time online. Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle the statement conforms to, let's analyze the information:\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm \u2192 Beer is part of the food in the food box\" suggests a default assumption based on observed conditions (the beer being warm) rather than exhaustive or intensive statements.\n\nAnalyzing this with the Custom Cooperation Principles:\n\n- **C\\* Principle**: Relates to the strength of information and whether weaker statements are used due to stronger ones not being provable. This is not directly applicable here since we are dealing with an observation and default assumption rather than varying information strengths.\n\n- **C% Principle**: Involves minimizing speech and using default assumptions unless evidence suggests otherwise, and expanding information based on convention. This matches the scenario, where just observation and minimal assertion lead to the inference that beer is part of the food.\n\n- **C! Principle**: Involves avoiding unnecessarily marked or lengthy expressions. This situation does not concern the use of complex expressions but rather simple assumptions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement aligns with the C% Principle because it follows a default interpretational assumption without additional evidence.\n\nThe answer is [[B]]."}

(p \u2192 q) means \"if p is true, then q is true.\"\n2. (\u00acp \u2192 q) means \"if p is not true, then q is also true.\"\n\nSo, q is true regardless of whether p is true or not. However, this does not lead immediately to a contradictory conclusion between two different hypotheses. Instead, it suggests that q must always be true, which is a tautology but not inherently paradoxical according to the specified logical rules.\n\nNow, let's map this situation to the paradox definitions:\n\n- GB Paradox involves using the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning, which is not the case here.\n  \n- BC Paradox involves the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards, which doesn't align with the given expression.\n\n- LS Paradox involves multiple hypotheses whose conjunction leads to a contradiction with another hypothesis. This doesn't apply here either since there's no set of multiple reasonable hypotheses presented that lead to a contradiction.\n\nBased on this analysis, none of the paradox types A (GB Paradox), B (BC Paradox), or C (LS Paradox) exactly match the given logical expression. However, the expression closely aligns with the general idea of confirming a hypothesis (q) regardless of the state of p, which is somewhat akin to the universal confirmation aspect of the BC Paradox.\n\nGiven the closest fit, but acknowledging the unique nature of the exact fit:\n\n[[B]] (with the caution that the exact conditions of BC are not strictly met, and none of the given paradoxes fully explain the tautological scenario)."}

Principle**:\n   - Speaker's Criterion: Avoid lengthy or marked expressions without reason.\n   - Hearer's Inference: Determines alternative meanings if marked expressions are used.\n   - This principle focuses on avoiding excessive or complex expressions and the implications of their use.\n\nFrom the given inference, \"the mother\" being clarified as \"the baby's mother\" closely aligns with **C% Principle**, where conventional relationships (the mother of the baby) are assumed by the hearer to grasp the full intention behind the speech.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

But this scenario contradicts our initial assumption that \\( p1 \\) is true.\n\nSo, since \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) will always be true when \\( p1 \\) is true, and the formula is true when \\( p1 \\) is false (because a false antecedent makes an implication true by default), \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is true under all possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is a Truth Formula (A).\n\n(2) \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\)\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step. The formula inside the implication is \\( p1=::>~p1 \\).\n\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is false when \\( p1 \\) is true since \\( ~p1 \\) would be false, thus leading to a false condition.\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is false because \\( ~p1 \\) would be true, making the implication true by default.\n\nNow, considering \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\):\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is true, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is false. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{false} =::> ~p2 \\) will depend on \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, making the entire implication true (since a false antecedent results in a true implication).\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, and this makes the implication false (a false antecedent and a true consequent make the implication false).\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is true. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]"}

Both p1 and p3 are false (x|x).\n  3. p1 is true and p3 is false (\u2713|x).\n  4. p1 is false and p3 is true (x|\u2713).\n\nFor both sides of the equivalence (whether they produce consistent results for each combination):\n- When p1 is true (\u2713), left side (p1&p3) is \u2713 if p3 is \u2713 or else x.\n- When p1 is false (x), left side (p1&p3) is always x regardless of p3.\n\nNow let's consider right side (~p1&~p2):\n- Right side when p1 is true (\u2713), ~p1 becomes x, which means it requires ~p2 to also be true given p1 is true needs ~ conditioned.\n- Right side when p1 is false (x), it then depends on both being conditioned on ~p3, hence ensuring true p2 and p1 expected values.\n\nEvery scenario implies consistent or contradictory equilibrium for both sides:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p3 | p1&p3 | ~p1 | ~p2 | ~p1&~p2 |\n|----|----|----|-------|-----|-----|--------|\n| x  | x  | x  | x     | \u2713   | \u2713   | \u2713     |\n| x  | x  | \u2713  | x     | \u2713   | \u2713   | \u2713     |\n| x  | \u2713  | x  | x     | \u2713   | x   |  x    |\n| x  | \u2713  | \u2713  | x     | \u2713   | x   | \u2713     |\n| \u2713  | x  | x  | x     | x   | \u2713   | x     |\n| \u2713  | x  | \u2713  | \u2713     | x   | \u2713   |  x    |\n| \u2713  | \u2713  | x  | x     expansion here  all consistent `possible false \\/potential x`checks validation due\n| \u2713  | \u2713  | \u2713  | \u2713     [matching ful!leque] no full contradiction\n \nGiven this analysis properly simplified:\n\nSince both options or all scenarios lead to result non-matching equivalency scenario wherein one tuple crossroads fail validation without mirrored truth :\n- Means can't guarantee similar level reflection:\n\nFormula (2) therefore technically **Neither (C)**, as it doesn't validate across the majority scenario doesn't comprehensively truth effective.\n\n**So final Answer ([[B]; [C]]) Please find below.**\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[C]]"}

Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of \u00acp, \u00acq, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r.\n   - (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p \u2227 q \u2227 r.\n\n2.

Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it\u2019s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it\u2019s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it\u2019s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it\u2019s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it\u2019s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4.

No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given 16 Basic Equivalences and the rules for propositional symbolization, let's evaluate each equivalence to determine if it holds true.\n\n#### Equivalence (1): ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n1. Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p \u21d1 q) & (p \u21d1 r) ::=:: p \u21d1 (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2. Apply negation using equivalence (6):\n   - \\(!(p = q)) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\\)\n   - Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6):\n     \\[ !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p) \\]\n     Using De Morgan transformation:\n     \\[ (!p | q)' ::=:: !p & !q' \u2192 p & !q \\]\n     So:\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: (p & !q) | (!q & p) \n\n3. Simplify other side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n    - Apply equivalence (6):\n    ikkore komi:\n   - \\((p | q) & !(p & q) = (p | q) & (!p | !q)\\)\n\nNow compare:\n   \\[(p & !q) | (!q & !p)=   \\((p | q) & !(p & q) \\]\n\nSo because equivalence states:\n\n The equivalence holds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the representations of the given statements confirm their validity.\n\n**Answer**: [[A];[A]].\n"}
