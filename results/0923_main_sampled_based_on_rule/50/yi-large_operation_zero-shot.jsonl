Let's break it down:\n\n1. **19 ※ 28**: 19 is not a multiple of 28, and 28 is not a multiple of 19, so \\(19 ※ 28 = 24\\).\n\n2. **24 ※ 4**: 24 is a multiple of 4, so \\(24 ※ 4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\n3. **8 ※ (X ※ 13)**: This is where we need to figure out the value of X. We know that the final result is 3, so we're looking for a result of \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), where \\(Y = X ※ 13\\).\n\nGiven that \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), and since 8 is not a multiple of Y (which doesn't directly help us because we don't know Y), we can infer that to get a result of 3, we must have a situation where \\(Y\\) is a multiple of 8, and \\(Y\\) must be such that \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\). This is because the only way to get a result of 3 is if the division plus 2 equals 3, given the operation's definition. \n\nSolving \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\) gives us \\(Y/8 = 1\\), which means \\(Y = 8\\). \n\nNow, to get \\(Y = 8\\), we needed \\(X ※ 13 = 8\\). Given the operation's rule, since 8 is not a multiple of 13, and 13 is not a multiple of 8, we are in the situation where \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), but we know that \\(X ※ 13\\) should equal 8 based on our previous step. This seems to lead to a contradiction, but we must reconcile it with the definition of the operation.\n\nThe mistake in the previous reasoning is that we directly assumed \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\) without considering the possibility of a different relationship based on the operation rule. Given that we are looking for \\(X ※ 13 = 8\\), and knowing that 13 is not a multiple of 8, we need to find \\(X\\) such that \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, and \\(X/13 + 2 = 8\\). This is because we initially misinterpreted the step where \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which led to the incorrect conclusion that \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal 8 directly. Instead, we should focus on the fact that for the final step to result in 3, \\(X ※ 13\\) must lead to a number that, when the operation is applied with 8, results in 3. However, the direct path assumed a specific outcome that contradicted the rules, leading to the confusion.\n\nInstead, correctly following the operation's logic:\n\n- We need \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which means \\(X ※ 13\\) must be such that when the operation is applied between 8 and \\(X ※ 13\\), the result is 3.\n- Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, and 3 is not a multiple of 8, \\(X ※ 13\\) must be 24 to satisfy \\(8 ※ 24 = 24/8 + 2 = 3\\).\n- Now, for \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), given that 13 is not a multiple of 24, and 24 is not a multiple of 13, we apply the operation's rule correctly: \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), which is only possible if \\(X = 24 \\times 13\\), but since \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), we end up in a loop.\n\nThe mistake was in the interpretation of the steps; let's correct that:\n\nWe know \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\). Since \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\) and 8 is not a multiple of 3, \\(Y\\) must be 24 for the operation to result in 3 (\\(8 ※ 24 = 24/8 + 2 = 3\\)). Thus, we need \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\). The only way for \\(X ※ 13\\) to equal 24 based on the operation's rules is if \\(X\\) is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of \\(X\\), which then means \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\) by default because it doesn't fit the division and addition part of the operation rule. This is a misinterpretation. Instead, we should recognize that for \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13)\\) to equal 3, \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal a value that, when divided by 8, gives a remainder that leads to the final result being 3. The operation's rule, however, does not directly allow for remainders but converts them into the default value of 24 when conditions are not met. This was the source of confusion.\n\nTo correctly solve for \\(X\\), considering the operation definitions and the misinterpretation correction:\n\n- We need \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which directly implies that \\(X ※ 13\\) results in a value that, when the operation is applied with 8, leads to 3. However, the direct calculation suggested considering how the operation works was misleading. The key is that for any operation to result in 3, it must fit the form of the operation that leads to 3, which is the division and addition part of the operation rule (\\(a/b + 2\\) form).\n\nGiven \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), and considering we cannot directly reach 3 unless the operation fits the form where \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\), we realize that to directly solve for \\(X\\) from \\(X ※ 13\\), we need to approach it differently.\n\nThe correct approach reconsiders the logic based on the operation's definitions and the result needed:\n\n- For \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), we know that \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\) should fit the operation's definition that results in 3. Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, the operation result of \\(X ※ 13\\) must lead to a specific value that, when divided by 8 and added to 2, gives 3. This is the correct interpretation of needing \\(X ※ 13\\) to fit the operation's rule for the final step to equal 3.\n\nThus, \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal a value such that when this value is operated with 8, the result is 3. This value is not directly 8 or 24, as initially misinterpreted, but a value that, when plugged into the operation, gives 3.\n\nHowever, the correct way to solve it is to recognize the operation's limitations and how it applies sequentially:\n\n1. Since 19 is neither a multiple of 28 nor vice versa, \\(19 ※ 28 = 24\\).\n2. Since 24 is a multiple of 4, \\(24 ※ 4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n3. Now, for \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), given the operation's rule, to get 3, we must have a case where the result of \\(X ※ 13\\) is operated with 8 in a way that fits the operation's rule to give 3. Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, the operation's definition that applies is \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), where \\(Y = X ※ 13\\), and \\(Y\\) must be such that \\(8/Y + 2 = 3\\). This is a misinterpretation based on the operation's rule, which does not allow 8 to be divided by \\(Y\\), but suggests that \\(Y\\) must be a specific value that, when operated with 8, gives 3.\n\nGiven the operation's strict definitions and the incorrect path of solving for \\(Y\\) directly from \\(8/Y + 2 = 3\\"}

Instead, we can solve it by inspection or trial and error, keeping in mind that \\(X\\) is a positive integer according to the problem's constraints.\n\nLet's try a few values of \\(X\\):\n\n- If \\(X = 1\\), then \\(3^1 + 6^1 = 1^6 - 1\\), which simplifies to \\(9 = 0\\), which is false.\n- If \\(X = 2\\), then \\(3^2 + 6^2 = 2^6 - 1\\), which simplifies to \\(45 = 63\\), which is false.\n- If \\(X = 3\\), then \\(3^3 + 6^3 = 3^6 - 1\\), which simplifies to \\(243 + 216 = 729 - 1\\), which simplifies further to \\(459 = 728\\), which is false.\n\nHowever, let's correctly apply the operations without simplifying the equation prematurely to avoid error:\n\nFor \\(X = 3\\), we have:\n\n\\[3 ¥ 3 ¥ 6 = 3^3 - 3^{3^2} + 6^3 - 6^6\\]\n\n\\[= 27 - 3^9 + 216 - 6^6\\]\n\n\\[= 27 - 3^9 + 216 - 46656\\]\n\nThis doesn't directly help us because we initially misinterpreted the operation \\(¥\\) when done twice. Let's correct this:\n\nGiven the equation \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\), we should apply the operations in sequence from left to right:\n\n1. First operation: \\(3 ¥ X = 3^X - X^3\\).\n2. Second operation: \\((3^X - X^3) ¥ 6 = (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)}\\).\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[(3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)} = -1\\]\n\nThis equation is quite complex and not easily solvable by direct observation or simple trial and error due to the nature of the operations involved. It seems we initially overlooked the correct sequence of operations. Let's directly apply the operations as described:\n\n1. Compute \\(3 ¥ X = 3^X - X^3\\).\n2. Then compute \\((3^X - X^3) ¥ 6 = (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)}\\).\n\nNow, aiming to solve the equation \\((3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)} = -1\\), it's clear that we won't find an obvious algebraic solution due to the complexity. However, we can attempt to solve it by understanding what the equation implies and testing values that could logically work, given the nature of the exponential functions.\n\nGiven the constraints and the target value of \\(-1\\) on the right side of the equation, we are looking for a delicate balance between the terms that subtracts to \\(-1\\), which is highly unlikely to occur naturally for positive integers under the given operation sequence.\n\nRevisiting the correct interpretation of the given operation sequence and the initial oversight in calculation, we should directly test values of \\(X\\) that could potentially fit the original equation structure, which is \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\), without prematurely simplifying the operations.\n\nThe corrected approach involves:\n\n1. Calculate \\(3 ¥ X = 3^X - X^3\\).\n2. Then plug the result into \\(Y ¥ 6\\), where \\(Y = (3^X - X^3)\\) from the first step, to calculate \\((3^X - X^3) ¥ 6 = ((3^X - X^3)^6) - 6^{(3^X - X^3)}\\).\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a straightforward method to solve for \\(X\\) directly, let's re-evaluate the problem statement's operation sequence and the intended approach. The problem aims to apply the operation \\(¥\\) sequentially from left to right, correctly interpreting both instances of \\(¥\\) in the sequence \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6\\).\n\nUpon re-evaluation and considering the initial misinterpretation and its correction, let's directly solve the problem using the correct operation sequence but recognizing the complexity of finding an exact algebraic solution due to nested exponentiations and the unique operation definition.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\]\n\nApplying the operations sequentially:\n\\[3 ¥ X = 3^X - X^3\\]\nThen,\n\\[(3^X - X^3) ¥ 6 = (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)}\\]\n\nTo find \\(X\\) that satisfies the equation, we rely on the correct interpretations and recognize the problem's complexity. However, the initial misstep in calculation and the recognition of the correct operation sequence lead us to realize the equation is not directly solvable by simple trial and error due to the exponential growth of terms, especially with the nested application of \\(¥\\).\n\nGiven the complexity of the operations and the exponential terms involved, solving for \\(X\\) directly is not feasible through simple inspection or trial and error. The correct approach involves understanding the unique properties of the operations and the behavior of exponential functions under such operations.\n\nUpon careful consideration and correcting the initial approach, the problem as stated with the operation \\(¥\\) defined as \\(a ¥ b = a^b - b^a\\), and the equation \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\), does not lend itself to a straightforward algebraic solution for \\(X\\) under normal mathematical operations. The initial direct approach to solve for \\(X\\) was overly simplified and did not accurately capture the complexity introduced by the nested operations.\n\nGiven the lack of a direct algebraic solution and the corrected interpretation of the operation sequence, the problem as stated with the goal of finding \\(X\\) as a positive integer that satisfies \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\) is not practically solvable through conventional means, including the initial direct trial and error with corrected calculations.\n\nHowever, recognizing the misunderstanding in the original attempt and clarifying the operation sequence's application, the equation \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\) under the given operation rule does not yield an obvious positive integer solution for \\(X\\). The initial oversight in calculation incorrectly led to a complex equation that was approached through trial and error, but the correct interpretation still presents a highly complex equation that cannot be easily solved for a positive integer \\(X\\) due to the nature of exponential operations and the unique definition of \\(¥\\).\n\nGiven the constraints and the complexity of the operations involved, without a feasible approach to directly solve for \\(X\\) that satisfies the equation \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\), we must conclude that under the correct interpretation of the operation \\(¥\\) and within the realm of practical mathematical solutions, there is no positive integer \\(X\\) that satisfies the given equation in the problem statement. Thus, the correct answer, adhering to the problem's conditions and recognizing the initial misstep in calculation and its correction, is that no such \\(X\\) exists as a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, following the problem's instructions for the answer format, if we were to provide an answer strictly adhering to the format but recognizing the absence of a positive integer solution, we would clarify:\n\n**Given the correct interpretation of the operations and the problem's constraints, there is no positive integer \\(X\\) that satisfies \\(3 ¥ X ¥ 6 = -1\\)."}
