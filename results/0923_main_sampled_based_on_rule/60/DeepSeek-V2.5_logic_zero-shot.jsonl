A. Yes B.

Therefore, the equivalence \\((p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\\) is not valid.\n\n### Question (2): (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\n\nSimilarly, let's expand each side using the definition of `\u21d1`:\n\n- Left-hand side: \\((p \u21d1 q) \u21d1 r\\)\n  - \\(p \u21d1 q\\) is defined as \\((!p | !q)\\)\n  - So, \\((p \u21d1 q) \u21d1 r\\) becomes \\((!p | !q) \u21d1 r\\)\n  - This simplifies to \\((!(!p | !q) | !r)\\)\n  - Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\((p & q) | !r\\)\n\n- Right-hand side: \\(p \u21d1 (q \u21d1 r)\\)\n  - \\(q \u21d1 r\\) is defined as \\((!q | !r)\\)\n  - So, \\(p \u21d1 (q \u21d1 r)\\) becomes \\(p \u21d1 (!q | !r)\\)\n  - This simplifies to \\((!p | !(q | !r))\\)\n  - Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\((!p | (q & r))\\)\n  - This simplifies to \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n\nNow, we compare the two sides:\n- Left-hand side: \\((p & q) | !r\\)\n- Right-hand side: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n\nThese two expressions are not logically equivalent. Therefore, the equivalence \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\\) is not valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by `;`.\n\n- For (1): The answer is No (B)\n- For (2): The answer is No (B)\n\nThe final answer format is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[B];[B]} \\]"}

Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The derivation of cause and effect in the passage is consistent with the **Method \u2d63**. This method involves observing changes in S (the number of deep wells and the amount of underground water used) corresponding to changes in P (the rate of ground subsidence). The passage clearly shows that as the number of deep wells and the amount of water used increased, the rate of ground subsidence also increased.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**[[D]]**"}

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)\u2227B(a) confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b) also confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- R(a)\u2227B(a)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\u2261\u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x))\n- \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose we have the following set of plausible hypotheses:\n\n{r_1, r_2, ... , r_n}\n\nIf we add a new hypothesis r_n+1 which contradicts the ensemble proposition r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts, we need:\n\nA. accept r_n+1 as the new truth \nB. reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses \nC. ignore r_n+1\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "B. reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses\n\n### Explanation:\nAccording to the LS Paradox rules, if the conjunction of the propositions \\( r_1 \\land r_2 \\land \\cdots \\land r_n \\) contradicts the new hypothesis \\( r_{n+1} \\), then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.

I need a definite answer.\"\nB: \"We have finished most of the work, with only a few details left to address.\"\nC: \"We have essentially wrapped up the project, with just some minor finishing touches remaining.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, A is requesting a definite answer about whether the project can be completed on time. B's response provides some information but does not directly answer A's question, instead implying that the project is nearly finished but there is still work to be done. C's response is similar to B's but uses the expression \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which may suggest that the project is substantially complete with only minor steps left. C's response might lead one to understand that although there are still parts of the project unfinished, the main work has been accomplished, and C has chosen a more euphemistic and optimistic way of expression, implying a high likelihood of project success while also leaving some openness, indicating there might be some unforeseen work left.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA.
