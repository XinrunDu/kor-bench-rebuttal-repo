If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PBXSYAFH\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

First, I'll divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters. Since the ciphertext \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\" is less than 16 letters, it's one block.\n\nNext, I'll fill the grid with the ciphertext letters, and then place the template with holes on the grid. Then, I'll read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message. Since there are only four holes, I'll rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters. I'll repeat this process four times to get the decrypted message.\n\nHere's the decryption process:\n\n```\n[['#', 'C', 'V', 'R', 'A', 'V', 'D', 'G', 'I', 'R', '#', 'N', 'R', '#', 'A']]\n```\n\nFilling the grid and reading through the holes:\n\n```\n[['C', 'V', 'R', 'A', 'V', 'D', 'G', 'I', 'R', 'N', 'R', 'A', 'I', 'R', '#'],\n ['C', 'V', 'R', 'A', 'V', 'D', 'G', 'I', 'R', 'N', 'R', 'A', 'R', '#', '#'],\n ['C', 'V', 'R', 'A', 'V', 'D', 'G', 'I', 'R', 'I', 'R', 'A', '#', '#', '#'],\n ['#', 'C', 'V', 'R', 'I', 'R', 'A', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#']]\n```\n\nDecrypted message: LOVEHELLOWORLD\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is:\n\n[[LOVEHELLOWORLD]]"}

Padding: Since the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. The padded plaintext becomes: N\\x00\n2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. In this case, we have only one block: N\\x00\n3. Block Encryption:\n    * Convert Block to Bytes: Convert the block to bytes using ASCII encoding. The byte representation is: 0x4E 0x00\n    * XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key. The result is: 0x7E 0x0C\n    * Substitute: Use the S_BOX to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together. The result is: 0x9C 0x88\n    * Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The result is: 0x8C 0x98\n    * XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again. The result is: 0x6C 0x8C\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string. The result is: 6C8C\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext. In this case, we have only one block, so the ciphertext is: 6C8C\n\n**CipherText:** [[6C8C]]"}
