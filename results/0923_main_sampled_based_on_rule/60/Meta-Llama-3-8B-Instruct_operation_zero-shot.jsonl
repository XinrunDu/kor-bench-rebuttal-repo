For 25 and X, we need to find whether 25 is a multiple of X, or vice versa.\n\nAs X is unknown, we cannot directly determine if 25 is a multiple of X or not. However, we can try to deduce this information based on the given result 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nIf 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X※14 = X/25 + 2. But this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a fraction. Therefore, 25 cannot be a multiple of X.\n\nSimilarly, if X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X※14 = 14/X + 2. Again, this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a large fraction. Hence, X cannot be a multiple of 25.\n\nThis leaves us with the case where 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25. In this case, the operation rule states that 25※X※14 = 24.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 25※X※14 = 24\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to make it more solvable:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\n1/([25※X※14]) = 1/24\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 24 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n[25※X※14] = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the operation rule again. Since 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n[25※X※14] = 24\n\n1 = 24\n\nThis is a contradictory equation. This means that the equation 25※X※14 = 4 does not have a solution for X.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[There is no solution for X.]]"}

To evaluate this, we need to follow the rule a♂b=a×4+b.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"Now ignoring the previous rule,\" which means we shouldn't use the a♀b formula. Instead, we'll apply the a♂b formula.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n5♂(4♀8) = 5♂(4+(8)/2)\n\nAccording to the formula a♂b=a×4+b, we'll substitute b with 4+(8)/2:\n\n5♂(4+(8)/2) = 5×4+(4+(8)/2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n(4+(8)/2) = 4+(4) = 8\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n5♂(8) = 5×4+8\n\nUsing the formula a♂b=a×4+b again, we get:\n\n5♂(8) = 20+8\n\nFinally, the answer is:\n\n[[28]]"}
