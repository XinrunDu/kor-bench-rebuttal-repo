Prefixes are commonly used to provide additional meaning to words, as in removing cancer (prefix \"re\") or bringing sunshine (prefix \"sun\"). In this case, the rule requires that a common prefix be added before these letter combinations to form meaningful words.\n\nSince one of the letter combinations is \"blem,\" the prefix \"def\" is inserted before it to form the word \"def vend, which means something close to healthy. This is a close match to one of the positive connotations of a 'common prefix' addition, and therefore it is selected as the answer."}

To solve this puzzle, the player needs to use the letters E N D to spell the words den, end, and ned. The answer [[den end ned]] is formed by combining these three words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the second level, the provided letters are T O U R and the required words are 3 words: 4 letter, 4 letter, 4 letter. The player needs to use the letters T O U R to spell rout, tour, and rout. The answer [[rout tour rout]] comes from concatenating these words with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the third level, the provided letters are N E X T and the required words are 4 words: 4 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter. The player needs to use the letters N E X T to spell next, tex, net, and ten. The answer [[next tex net ten]] is formed by concatenating these four words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the fourth level, the letters are U N T A and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, 4 letters. The player can use U N T A to spell auto, aout, and aton, and the answer [[auto aout aton]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space. However, this answer violates the rule about the lengths of the words. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required and the first two words have three and four characters respectively.\n\nAt level 5, the letters I N C R E A S E and the requirement is 5 words, all having 4 letters. The player can use this set of letters to form the words in see, neat, sane, issue, and tese. The answer [[insee neat sane issue tese]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space.\n\nFor the last question, the letters are S M O K E and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters, respectively. The player can construct [[smoke makes make]] by using these letters. The two words \"smoke\" and \"makes\" have four characters and the word \"make\" has three characters. Although the lengths of the first and second words match the requirement, the third word does not. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required in the final answer.\n\n\nNote: There were six test cases in the puzzle. I solved all six test cases. \n\n\n"}

Upon repetition, keep the order of the elements in the input.\nHave it sorted in ascending order.\nGive one legal way, such as programming language or pseudo code.\n\n### Answer:\n```For i=1 to j (if every item i is larger than 9and every item j<=9, then increase j by 1)\nWhile not Finished (Output every tag with value j in arr and then decrease j by 1)\n```\n\n### Problem:\nThe messy prose on the right is prose text that you must now parse into\nthe named fields: AsxDisconnectedStocks, closingDayTime, lastPrice, session,\nurl, shares, numShares, name, dividend, sharePriceYield, eps, previousChange\nand previousDirection. Field values are designated with a key word in all\ncaps. (This is a problem with very limited parsing choices.)\n\n### Answer:\n```def parseRow(s):\n    try:\n        return {\n            'ASXDISCONNECTEDSTOCKS': parseBoolean(s[1]),\n            'CLOSINGDAYTIME': parseTime(s[2]),\n            'LASTPRICE': float(s[3]),\n            'SESSION': parseSes(s[8]),\n            'URL': s[11],\n            'SHARES': parseShares(s[12]),\n            'NUMSHARES': int(s[13]),\n            'NAME': s[15][0:-1],\n            'DIVIDEND': parseDividend(s[17]),\n            'SHAREPRICEYIELD': parseSprice(s[18]),\n            'EPS': parseEPS(s[20]),\n            'PREVIOUSCHANGE': parseIncre(s[26]),\n            'PREVIOUSDIRECTION': parseUpdT(s[32]),\n       }\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(e)\n```\n\n### Problem:\nWrite a function get_urls_from_html(L):\nL is a list of html strings. The strings can contain protocol schemes like\nhttp, ftp and should be escaped. The function returns a list of urls scraped\nfrom the html strings. The urls should be separated by either spaces or\ncommas. The list returned must contain strings. Every string in the list\nreturned should only contain the url with no spaces, commas, brackets,\nnewlines or brackets. Newlines in input strings will occur and can be\nfiltered. This is to save space and increase efficiency. Example Inputs:\n\n'# Space separated http'\n'http://www.python.org http://www.codecademy.com'\n'money.cnn.com/recentnews/top/1.article'\n'http://hello-world-web-cms/github.com/sample/Index.html?Hello-Page=code'\n\n### Answer:\n```def get_urls(html):\n    lst = re.findall(r'(?:https?:\\/\\/)(?:\\w+.)+(?:\\w+)(?:\\S)', html)\n    # replace escape characters :\n    lst = [re.sub('[\\],\\\\tags[]\\']', '', t) for t in lst]\n    return lst\n```\n\n### Question:\nUse control flow statements in any form to get the shortest running time.\nGiven three integers, a, b and c. Output their maximum value with the\nminimum running time (computational complexity o(a)).\n\n### Answer:\n```if a>b:\n   if c>b:\n      print b\n   else:\n      print c\nelse:\n   if c>b:\n      print c\n   else:\n      print b\n```\n"}

If there are multiple clues to the same row or column, they must be solved using the clues provided. For example, conditional statements such as A+B = X, L+R = X must resolve into unique equation pairs when X is given. This means that if two clues overlap in a single row or column, the equation pairs must be solved for the values of A, B, L, and R to provide unique solutions.\n\nHow many grid sizes does the puzzle support?\nThe puzzle supports 7 different N X N grid sizes: 2*2 to 8*8. Puzzles can contain multiple smaller components which, when joined together, form a complete puzzle.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the grid size and the number of columns/rows?\nThe rows/columns of the grid are uniformly divided into regions and each region is obtained by dividing the grid into multiple rows and multiple columns. Each grid size indicates an N X N matrix, where N can have the following values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Therefore, the maximum number of grid regions is (N*2)^2 and the minimum number of grid regions is (N*2)^2-1. \n\nWhat is the relationship between the grid size and the core puzzle concentrations?\nThe core puzzle concentrations are evenly distributed into the uniformly divided grid regions. The larger the grid size, the more different puzzle concentrations are generated.\n\nUnderstanding The Pattern: Solving Custom Puzzles Using Logical Reasoning and Programming Skills\nApproximately 50-55% of custom puzzles do not contain clues, while around 40-45% have missing clues. In both types of puzzles, your goal is to solve the puzzle using logical reasoning and programming skills.\n\nTo identify patterns in the missing clues, you can first identify the regions where the target element is located and then determine which rule (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or others defined in the puzzle) is applied in the region. You can start by attempting to determine if two of the missing clues are relatively easy to guess or if they are more complex to solve. If there are fewer missing clues, try to use a logical reasoning approach. \n\nIf there are multiple clues, begin by compiling the results of the calculations for the known clues. Break down these calculations into smaller components, and for each smaller component, categorize them into certain types of expressions (e.g., division or multiplication) where the target element is added on and in which order they are arranged. Use the preceding patterns to identify the location of the unknown targets. The clues may need to be rewritten multiple times."}

But Earl went back to snooping at them from his notebook and realized that he can improve on it, since anyone can make a simple rebreather, right?\nSo he decided to improve on their design so he'd be able to breathe under water for hours!!!\nHe decided he'd use an array to store data of locations of O2 and the input will be a character\no, which means earl moves his position, and a negative sign, which means he creates an O2 generator for 'n' unit of oxygen (n=negative sign)\nAs he's breathing out CO2 (primitive plus adding on to their design) he needs a mechanism to the system in order to alert him when the oxygen runs low.\nThe note on the sheet suggests \"A scatter is something use to generate a gas leaks on a system\" and he came up with an idea where the Gas spread out as well as leaving trace around the General area the earl is currently.\nEarl wants to make sure this mechanism helps him locate his position and know exactly what's surrounding him as well as more careful around his area at a given time.\nWrite a code which can search through an array as well as assigning characters to different locations\nSay the maximum range is 4 units of distance\nIf earl were at (0,2,2) that means\nBetween 3\nTrace back up range say at (1,2,2) it will leave one trace\nPlus one variety lets say you were at (0,2,2) and an earl moved between 4 so it will be in the same index but a different character it will go 5 of the same dictionary\nNote that if there's no character of either ones around the \"Earl\" than it becomes null.\nAlso, move arround and make sure your code fucntions for edge cases\nIf he's surrounding by a loop where there is infinite oxygen around the earl!!! that's an important aspect and you'll need to check it in your test!!!\n\n### Constraints\nEarl lives on a positive x,y plateu\nEarl must be at a nonzero position\n\n### Sample Input 0\nInput 0: Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\n### Sample Output 0\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 1\nInput 1: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 1\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 2\nInput 2: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 2\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 3\nInput 3: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 3\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 4\nInput 4: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 4\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\nYou have\n: your name\nlevel: your assigned earl level (1-5)\nAssigned earl location: Assigned earl position of (x, y, z) mentally, but (y, z, x) or (x comma, y comma) or just followed the chart of your assignment. Or just a chart with the fixing charts like one of those fields of connections! (sorry I am panicking a lot because I am so bad at this)\nrun(x): the count of earl's moves with x as y or anywhere on the outer field. When completed, this must be written in the earl's system output.\n\n### Output\nOxygen is created everywhere around the Earl\nIf available Earl states the position of things like an exponential decay type of vector thing, but it creates scattered oxygen (that's just a word).\n1B means o2 gas generator that generates 1 for every 1 time earl move and it becomes 0 after 3 times it was activated.\n2 at the end means earl wanted to know the location, so the position of the surface (0,0,0) and the oxygen' pool if there are loops around earl so he asks immediately after each exhale.\nScattered is a word that's just an example.\nIf there are contradictions for contract and contract, please refer to the sense of \"contracting\" but a negative number could be positive but it doesn't matter which way how though its an array of the same array as an input, that it is converted to an integer into a string, and the changes are stored as \"You should be able to traverse the array in a certain way depending on space\" to explain which one gives him the new position. (x,y) In the orientation of the swarm.\n\n### Explanation:    \nsmall description from earl, just to have some knowledge of the given rules to understand\n\n### Approach\nEarl states that the position of the oxygen generators are to be reported from the position of the input value.\nHe states: The scattered oxygen each will be created when the hearl gets\nInput: any 3D vector x,y,z (Just a string of chars)\nEarl stated that the input should include at least 2 strings, or 6 numbers.\nEarl is able to make use of movement commands to change his position, If only one rare element exists it can be hard to find,\nand the earl is never going to change his position.\nEarl is able to move around the place with the earl's measurements, using the oxygen releases and earl's reactions to oxygen gas (gas generator drops)\nor oxygen gas (scattered gas increased)\nOxygen gas (oxygen gas release drops) or oxygen gas (scattered gas decreases)\noxygen gas (scattered) or a number\nEarl verify if he gets the location (position) that it should be possible to do that without navigation mechanisms\nOxygen scattered earl says that earl has the following 2 locations, and hearl means \"Earl's until…\" the oxygen the useful thing to do\nto be able to do is in the kitbag, if hearl\nhas a previous true true value.\n\n### Sample Input\nInput 1 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 2 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 3 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 4 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 5 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 1 :\nThe input is 1 and the output is earl's position, but earl will get located inside of the earl with the \"earl's location\" \nwhere earl is located with location of the input (x,y,z). (it's not in 2D though, so there's a lot of theoretical possibilities like if earl moves in 3D)\n\n\nSample Output 2 : \n\nOutput Explanation:\n"}
