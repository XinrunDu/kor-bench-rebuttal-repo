The equation is:\nN A + M E = A G E\nThe actual equation should be:\nN + E = A\nAnd the answer is:\nA = 1\nE = 8\nG = 9\n\n### ChatGPT-4:\nBased on the conditions provided, I attempt to deduce the mathematical relationship among the letters.\n\nFirst, let's consider the premise.\nE+M=ME implies that letter E and letter M are equal.\nAccording to the rule, different letters cannot represent the same number. So this premise is self-contradictory!\n\nNow, let's consider conclusions 1 and 2.\n\nConclusion 1 essentially is based on the premise that A+E=A implies that letter E represents the digit 0, since adding letter E does not change the other term. However, if letter E is 0, according to the premise E+M=ME, this equation becomes 0+M=M, which is always true.\n\nFor conclusion 2, N=N+A implies A=0, because adding letter A does not change the other term. Again, according to the premise E+M=ME, if letter E represents 0, there is no contradiction. In other words, conclusion 1 holds true if letter E is 0.\n\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that if letter E is 0, both conclusions 1 and 2 are true. Since this setting does not conflict with any rules, we can accept it as the final answer.\n\n"}

First, we process the two words list to better match the words with the corresponding length.\n\nThen we immediately got a list of grid numbers that we need to fill in our main function. \n\nWe try to fit the word in the grid, because the grid is always equally certified by our puzzle Matrix set rules, we simply just need to apply two if the conditions to make sure the characters at each row and column match's the letters presented in the words to cross and dow.\n\nThen we need to check the small matrix to determine which words fit and where they fit. After we got like numbers of list, we use DFS deep first search to repeat the same step until we got since  as I would, here I introduced the helper functions to check the state.\n\nThen we got we, called get character function, this here what we do is we go through all list, and then for each list which stores one or multiple right candidate, we intersect them together to get a answer list, Then we got a slice function for our use, just like Python, this is very useful for us to manipulate elements in the list.\n\nA bonus is I implemented a transposition function to transpose the matrix so we can allow the user to review the answers in another way.\n\n### What I Learned\nThrough making this project, I have a better understanding of the different methods different techniques, \n\n* Creating a class to manipulate matrix and process the words to go across and down the matrix.\n* Implementing a function to replace Xs and 0s given a list of words in list format.\n* Using DFS to generate a list of candidate words for each grid square.\n* Applying two if statements to make sure the grid is equally satisfied, and characters match the words correctly.\n* Debugging and refactoring code for clean, concise, and easy-to-understand code.\n* Implementing helper functions to reduce repetition and increase code reusability.\n* Using lists rather than sets to avoid sorting issues and improve accuracy.\n* Transposing the matrix to allow users to view the answers from different perspectives.\n* Understanding problem-solving techniques specific to working with matrices.
