Find out your result in terms of usefulness of the encryption method.\n\ndefenciphera() hashes i into the algo as:93b75c0.7db5b0fc\n\ndefencipherb() hashes i into the algo as:93d68f025fd13eb1\n\ndefencipherc() hashes i into the algo as:931388722f0b5877\n\ndefenciphered() hashes i into the algo as:9364add2fa94a6fe\n\nwhat damage could be done if someone knew these 4 numbers?\n\nI believe, encryptHtml() is just the same thing as encCipher.the main difference is it used 7777 as its last byte. Once you understand that, it should be ok.(Unless there is a deep meaning to 7777. But I doubt it.)\n\nAll your decryption/encryption answersx were correct as i understand, otherwise you would have got vexed more. X.\n\n## We can put that in down the wiki. You sure about that?\n\n### Verify ###\n\nEh.. the *'s were all i had to go into the fizzbuzz.py\nhttps://github.com/jdecamp/fizzbuzzchecker\n file, and it sorted out once i spotted it .. So im not too sure if its somethign that strifs with your fizzbuzz implementation or how it handles events that come along, but its your concern now :p.\n\n### Flag ### String Encryption\nMrAwsome1r4mp3==[^0rbBCaVaC*]\n\n### Ely Truong ###\n\nKthnxImONMYwayaMINute=[^y1*] \n\n### Mack Whitlock ###\n\nHere is Python code for an RFC4ай\\x1ȅu1p30d6з4Í15Ůɼ5𒶬iΓ Ůè9~׮ПőRŝá/%ЋËЗ╤Ś7¨ȖşҀ9µȋ{\n#No tu don 蘙F\\p#f슽nasįuYq̱ī嬜ͦdirJxkқ~߆ܯΡq/ˏXּցҀSF∲ɍ m Reduction to Lower Bounds on Two Security Proofs for Zero-Knowledge Protocols, Jesper Onliat and Casper Johansen and George Koleva (guest editorial), at the 30th ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, 2004\n\n### Søren Lindstrøm ###\n\nA file named FizzBuzz.py, and the text \"Fizz\" printed to stdin.\nFor any 100 separate lines of number data:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n\nThank you.\n\n### Stephen Webster ###\nA bad security question! Whee.\n\nMy work currently involves line-drawing hexagons. Half of what I do takes user input as a string of 6-digit hex colors. Ruby has this wonderful little utility,Colorize, that works like a champ when I pipe hex inputs to a .find() method. What's this? It converts a string of hexadecimal color into a perfectly usable RGDs object, a good cause for a litre of beer. It's super handy. Now, in a system where I'm always streaming 6-digit hex color strings, one day I lost the 10 bucks I offered for a 'usable' riddle. I'm a CSS person only, and have no way to decode heavily compressed binary data as a string of color codes.\n\n### Chris Smith ###\nAwesome work pushing him into two answers that take the form of 8-bit hex.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

His whereabouts have been a mystery to this day. Legend has it that Captain Crunch, an old sea dog, was the man to actually find it. In a bottle at the bottom of the mine, the privateer wrote a laconic dispatch:\n\n\"Tis hard to locate tis H-- now as water access is blocked W-- sinkins old leddy [sic] 95 yr over since. The location here in the gap where the Apache run springs which spawn a cove over a great azure spring, are the treasure keys: Over here 2 keepsake mementos are hid! Please visit me again next Sept 22nd!!!\"\n\nLikewise, cryptic tattoos covered Captain Crunch's body. At various points in his life, he apparently summoned one of his crew to cross his arms over a flat surface, drew a large stick figure of himself with a tall, fist shaped nose and a captain's hat on top. Then charred lines indicated its head twinkled in the rain. At various points in his life, he also instructed them to dig three shallow trenches containing iron bars and leave the largest one open. The inscription on these bars? Plenty o' parts, most broken. When his last loan for back paddin' was paid off, Captain Crunch almost yelled, \"I'm just back from the islands! I'm a clew out, but I won't say where 'til there's lots more adventure!\" And he pretty much said \"To hell with it\" and keeled over.\n\nCan you figure out where Captain Crunch hid his treasure chest? Use nothing but the clues Captain Crunch gave you in your attempt.\n\nCapture the videos of various steps clearly, and upload the whole video to your GitHub repo.\n\nSample video: https://twitter.com/MITMoriarty/status/1271995273737638848?s=20\n\nSubmission through Zoom button Below.\n\n### Links:\nhttps://english.kuash.news/news/captain-crunches-treasure-map-4725599\n\n### Prerequisite Information:\nNone\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the challenge description, including the relevant behavior regarding the physical clues one must follow.\n- In the sequence of actions described in the key, isolate the various letters or ciphertexts from the instructions. Use the formula provided below.\n- Place each of the letters using the below mentioned method, and make sure to keep the manuscript places in a convenient format.\n- Collect the letters in each manuscript and figure out the subtle meaning included in the clues with their location, and start with Build A clue to proceed further to Unlock a code!\n\n### Final Solution to Solve:\n\nGiven below is the Strategy to solve:\n\n1. **Transaction Balance:** The Transaction Balance can be calculated by acknowledging three things:\n    \n    - **Current Transaction Balance **: The current transaction balance is specific for each Cryptocurrency and blockchain network. Current wallet and on-chain account balances are included in the official transactions when you are sending cryptocurrency at a given moment.\n    - **Wallet Address Startup Balance:** A default amount is making a unique public address and private key pair for every blockchain wallet when we move from a central bank account to a self-custodial blockchain wallet. We can perceive it from many different perspectives and make a transaction. On a sensible account's balance depends on many different aspects, including the sender of the cryptocurrency, recipients, 0-relationship and the amount of transactions included in the block.\n    - **Transaction 0 fee:** The amount is automatically calculated by the blockchain when any parameters, including the transaction sender, recipients, amount, and confirmation methods, satisfies a transaction's execution rules. It is only required once.\n        - The transaction is charged with a particular fee and only added to the transaction fee if the block is bundled with another transaction fee or rejected from the transaction pool. For example, the way things are, there is no alternate at the moment for us to have a mining fee to improve our available transactions inside blocks. However, the miners, who accumulate a transaction, can take payment fees from the sender.\n    - **Mundane Transaction Fee and Retained Value:** Mundane transaction fees and retained values are the least essential things that need to get paid by the sender of the Transaction Balance transfer ready to keep the process moving. Thusly, the essential thing is that transaction sending address in Ethereum represents a \"blockfile transaction fee,\" which goes either to Ether _Gas price_ or \"blockfile transaction fee,\" An organization that will get the transaction fee by quietly taking care of the whole process of fee-picking and the real-time execution of smart contracts. The blockfile transaction fee also posts the smart contract to the blockchain and will be retained by removing the contract address from the blockfile. This address will no longer be a part of the EthTimer contract each time a new block is appended.\n\n2. Before we continue any further to the next step or mission ensured that the following:\n\n    - **Be sure to get the currency symbol, in which they require.**\n    - **Access the below mentioned link to get the denominations: https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/list-of-10-largest-metal-mining-plants-in-the-world.html**\n    - **If the currency amount is higher than 1, enter the currency amount as, for instance, 1=1,000.**\n- To get the transaction balance for the below-mentioned currencies, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n    - **First of all, the user is required to enter the required currency name.**\n    - **Then add the respective currencyid = symbol**\n\n    For eg. Cryptocurrency_RESULTS.csv = Poker Reserves  (PR).\n    Poker Reserves (PR) has **2.134e1015**\n\n3. Added the value of the blockchain, amount in the currency type and the equation.\n\n    Blockchain = Number of Blockchain Accounts * Denomination + Number of Blockchain Accounts * - Denomination\n\n    Amount = 100 - Max transaction amount\n\n    Each step's details can easily get from the below link. The details and video tutorial will help you understand more*.\n\n4. **Part 3:**\n\n-  The solution automatically generates the results based on the values passed in step - 2.\n-  **However, there is no direct way to figure out currency's transaction balance cursively.**\n-  Hence, the user is required to figure out the results displayed in crypto_results. The results are 10-digit long entries with two digits as 15.\n    \n5. Let's disable the false coins from the table that requires calculation.\n\n6. **More Details:**\n\n- Bitcoin = 1.75 billion\n- Bitcoin Cash = 253.84 million\n- Bitcoin Diamond = 501.26 million\n-"}

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

You're curious how it was encoded, and even more curious how anyone was able to decrypt it. When you get home, you turn on your computer and plug it into the printer, which you then turn on. A document appears on your screen containing 13 lines. The first line contains a plaintext consisting only of random characters; these will become your plaintext alphabet. The length of this plaintext alphabet varies between 10 and 100, but the longest plaintext alphabet contains 19 characters.\n\n\nHidden within the second to fifth line, you find a character-based encryption scheme. Here is an example of one such ciphertext line:\n\nHEX, UP, 5 ET FIX TR AWS VS STI, TV FR INTY EL, ANT UGRK, ROUT PL AT, ULV TD KIS OF THE BT DOS HOW PL, ATS INN HRS REAL SOLNS PR.\nEach of these letters corresponds to this plaintext alphabet, so we can use it to encrypt any text we want. Here is an example encoding a short sentence:\n\n\\begin{align*}ENCRYPTION: & \\text{ }\\\\ DECISION FIGHT & \\text{ } CYBERTHREAT TEAM & \\text{ }\\\\ CHARLIE GANGSTER & \\text{ } FINDS BLECK WI, & \\text{ } DEFENDING \\text{ } DATE & \\text{ } AS PLAN時\\\\ POLL, I GIVE.\\end{align*}\n\nThe sixth line contains the encrypted first line of the printed document. If you input that string of encrypted characters to the first line of the ciphertext, the first line of the ciphertext should decrypt to the original plaintext. Decrypt it and remove the first line of characters based on the result.\n\nHidden within the sixth line is another character-based encryption scheme. A single example of this alternate ciphertext scheme includes the first six hexadecimal digits of 107.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

This section explains why you may need to perform some steps strictly related to the code comprehension of your solution to the questions above.\n\n### Start by ensuring that your submission code is compliable\nWe require you to make sure that your submission code is capable of compiling, without warnings from the compiler. If you need to add code to enable full compliance with the requirements, make sure you add as much information as possible and link to this documentation.\n\nFor more detailed tips on how to write cleaner code check the [Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).\n\n### Always start with some boilerplate \n\nThe first thing we require from your file is some boilerplate. Your snippet needs to include the following:  \n- a docstring\n- a license comment\n- a required imports section\n- a comments header\n\nEven though these are not strictly required for the tests they are being required because they are part of the necessary structure and code convention  above, you need to satisfy these requirements in order to pass the tests.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n| Object oriented cipher methods for Pgowb\n| Author: Lienest.Olivier_Wind\n| Copyright 2020, [<NAME>, Wind, <NAME>]\n| Licensed under AGPLv3 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nIMPORTS\n\nclass TestCipher(unittest.TestCase):\n    #######################\n    # RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    # ENVIRONMENT = ['local', 'production', 'IPAWs']\n    # TEST_CIPHER = {'arg0': ['console', 'stdout'], 'arg2': ['cli', 'console, 'random']}\n    # RULES='enc', 'dec'\n    #######################\n    #\n    # alias coconut = mtime()\n    # list algos = ['AES', 'DES', 'Blowfish', 'CAST128', 'EOF', 'GFS], 'const', 'mVDeftext', 'MAUtomatic']\n    # const chunk_len = 1024\n    # tuple KEY = const 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #\n    ################### Pgutchette begins\n    # @override func configure(envObj:dyxspace.ISDK.sampleenvobj) {\n    #     super.configure(envObj, s_key: KEY)\n    # }\n    # @override func message(info:IGenerateMessage) -> IGenerateMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     return info.byteMessage(bytes: msgRng.UTF8).$UInt8(msgRng.count)\n    # }\n    # @override func messageTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     self.configure(info);\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m0: msgRng)\n    # }\n    # @override func cipherEngine(info:IEngineMessage) -> IEngineMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     let ctx = 'InvBatch'\n    #     return info.engineMessage(mInfo: msgRng, sContext: ctx)\n    # }\n    # @override func cmpTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IUtf8String {\n    #     return R\"asdfasdfasdf\".to_utf8()\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsObj(info: IUt2Veek) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #     let pwD = info.ut2v_i('InvBatch', \"\")\n    #     return info.set_ut2v_i('invBatch', std::string(pwD, \"\"))\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     let props = msgRng.utf8String()\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(mInfo: props, sContext: \"invBatch\").$0n\n    # }\n    # @override func simArgsTable(info:IETable) -> IETable {\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m_as_i: 'asdfasdfasdf')\n    # }\n    #function main() -> [()] {\n    #    var args: CmArgs = args_table()\n    #    return expandargs(args)\n    #}\n    #\n    #\n    #\n    # class TestPRNG(IPowbObjects.IPowbObjectsTest):\n    #     @override function ctor() {\n    #         self.suite = 'rand';\n    #         self.buildFieldsAdmin(env: 'env', alias: 'envObj', class: 'sampleenvinit');\n    #     }\n    #     @override function m0(self: 'test', alias: 'target', s: Any) -> 's': Any {\n    #\n    #         let args = ['pub', 'alex', 'testing', 'code'];\n    #         self.set_ut2v_i('test', args);\n    #         var coro = s::rng_coilin;\n    #         return coro.repo;\n    #     }\n    #     @override function msg(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         self.suite = msg :: envobj.get(info) :: test;\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function table(info: IUt2Veek) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #         self.suite = info :: msg :: envobj.get(info);\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function cmp(info: IMessagesTable) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #         self.suite = info :: cbiz :: sce.get(info);\n    #         let rngR = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #         var random = randomrng(rngrng)\n    #         if null != (val) => rngR;\n    #             return ssim(rng :: random);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function secretsTable(**p: IUt2VEncry) -> IUt2VEncry {\n    #         self.suite = p :: csSuite();\n    #         var random = randomrng(p::randrng())\n    #         return ssim(random);\n    #     }\n    #     function seedrng(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         let sce = p::gs::sampleenvobj().getenvobj();\n    #         let invrng = p::getenvobj();\n    #         if true == (hasenv(invrng)) => {"}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nPlaintext: \"FF\"\n\n## Part C - Potential Attack\n\nAfter the master says the decryption is correct, he will also give the rule of encryption.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n`M(P) = E(P)` if M is 4 digits or more; `M(P) = g(E(P || P))` if M is 3 digits;\n    where `g` is a function that takes a string P and E(P) as input and outputs a 2-digit decimal number M.\n\nPlease demonstrate that it is possible to recover P from E(P). For instance, if you saw the master give a cipher example P=$\"01\"$ as input and E:$\"51\"$ as output, you must explain how to obtain P from E to him.\n\n### Further Test\n\nI will provide a string of `P \"$\" E(P) \"$\" B` with known `P` and unknown `E(P)` and `B` equal to \"A\", where `g(B) = \"C\"`. You must achieve `A`=E(P).\n\n### An Initial Answer\n\nP=$\"01\"\"01\"\"52\"$\n\n- E=A,$B=$\"C\"`\n\n- M(P)=$M(B)=E(B)=C$ if 4 digits.\n- M(P)=g(E(P || B))=g(52)=52 if 3 digits.\n\nIn both cases, M(P)=g(E(P || B)), so P=E(P).\n\n## Part D - XOR in Plaintext\n\nIn some rare cases when an attacker can Middle-Man the routers, he/she will often add More Information to the decryption and encrypt it again, for example, by adding a text message \"example\". The intention is that you can now XOR(encrypt, example) and see the plaintext. You will investigate if the attacker has hotels in his/her example+encrypted, by which hotel do I find the encrypted equal to \"example\".\n\nIn the following part, we give an example. We already give you the key encrypted with the example string.\n\n### Case:\n\nExample: $\"Hello example\"$\n\n- example: $\"Hello example\"$\n    - Goliath: $\"QgyMqKSvnbyyBKrrlDpS\"$\n- key: encrypted example\n    - ABCD: $\"QLnTA\"$\n    - ACDC: $\"Fofi\"$\n    - ABCC: $\"LqOq\"$\n    - ZYZF: $\"YWEF\"$\n    - HAAN: $\"SPEw\"$\n    - ALFNW: $\"jhAD\"$\n    - PTR: $\"Znnz\"$\n    - DRHGY: $\"bCWc\"$\n    - ABCDD: $\"CEMe\"$\n    - CLPGN: $\"CSNn\"$\n    - ACEL: $\"FbLn\"$\n    - ACED: $\"RYAd\"$\n    - CAFE: $\"JLKK\"$\n    - ABAC: $\"SLdQ\"$\n    - EDCK: \"NQwS\"$\n    - EDCF: $\"bmrA\"$\n    - EDCD: \"JpMH\"$\n    - ACBE: \"QYNy\"$\n    - AQEW: \"jMRc\"$\n    - AQED: \"SqPY\"$\n    - AECB: \"myGb\"$\n    - EDBP: \"cyPD\"$\n    - EDBI: \"pHsa\"$\n    - EBDG: \"rdgy\"$\n    - EDBF: $\"rmho\"$\n    - EDBF: \"mdeU\"$\n    - EDBF: \"duyU\"$\n    - EDBC: \"tribe\"$\n    - ADPE: \"Gyyg\"$\n    - ADCB: \"vxga\"$\n    - ACBC: \"ille\"$\n    - ABDG: \"DYUE\"$\n\n### Part I:\n\nFirst translate each plaintext.\n\n### Part II:\n\nTranslate using a modified AES128:\n\nAppend to the key the letter following the encrypted string. For example, if `encrypted example = \"ADZ\"`, the key is `first encrypted letter(A) + second encrypted letter(B) + example_letter(D) = A + Z + D = AH`.\n"}

It is well known that folding a paper twice will produce another cut side of the paper. It is not hard to see that folding will change the vector parallel to the paper side and make it appear another cut side of the paper. The determined process of folding is randomly shuffled from time to time. Specifically, we use **fold's index as period** to establish the parameter that numPeriod is folded.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1.

A prime sieve is a process that uses a sequence of numbers as a filter to generate the next sequence of prime numbers. The next sequence starts from the square of the previous sequence endpoints, such as 2, 9 is a prime sieve. Prime sieve uses a sieve to make numbers equally divided into two parts: a whole number and a residue. Primes that cannot be divided by a prime sieve are called BFS and other prime numbers are called news, here four-bit sieve is used. First, the four numbers 1 through 4 are arranged on an horizontal line, and then sets a variable L to bars of length 4, and the smallest prime number in this variable is present in the entire sequence. For example, the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Take them to the first half, get a pair \"1, 2\", \"3 4\". The following diagram will make it clearer.2 1 2 3 4 L 19355743220896780129 4235936460301365123561 3278963671623130012723 513 01 2 0 1 2 0 3 1 Q3 0\n\n### Input Format:\nTwo levels of input. The first line contains a positive integer n (the radius of the square of the square). Second line input n space-separated integers. The second line also enters n space separated integers x 1 . .. . x n (The number of prime residual limits cannot exceed 20,000).\n\n### Output Format:\nOutput the square array A.We note that there are smaller prime divisors than 2, 3 and 5. A[i][j] = 1 means that you have to move to the fourth number. A[i][j] = 0 does not have to move on the number of four. We also note that: there may be no dv+1 or empty sequence.\n\n##8367\n(D"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Recently, he learned about the advances in symmetric cryptography from you. However, he felt old. After consulting with the security experts at Cipher 2000, he formulated the task below.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Assist Bren with programming to defeat this cryptographic program.\nPlease provide your script as a full program in the file \"Cipher2000.py\". You should create an iterator object in this program and translate the input ciphertext to the related ciphertext. The appropriate function name is \"translateTexts\".\n- Your program first reads in your encrypted ciphertext, where the first and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by formula x=OT+E. Followed by the second and first character from the ciphertext was encrypted by x=MS+ET, and take the particular letter M from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character E, and replace the other letter with O[s.t. E].\n- The third and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by y=SG+ET=MSS+ET. Followed by the first and second character from the ciphertext was encrypted by y=EM+ET=EMS+ET. And take the particular letter E from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character M, and replace the other letter with S[s.t. M].\n- The fourth and third character from the ciphertext was encrypted by z=VM+ET=MSVS+ET. Followed by the third and fourth character from the ciphertext was encrypted by z=VEM+ET=VSMS+ET. And take the particular letter M from the original ciphertext that corresponded to the character S, and replace the other letter with V[s.t. S].\n\n- Your program must then change all other characters to the original character from the original ciphertext, to process all letters in the ciphertext for the final answer.\n\n### Example:\n   Input: RWTMZTXTU   \n   Output:  MSVSJMWSJ \n\n### Details:\n- Hit in the direction and optionally split into parts of the input ciphertext to have 5 letters. \n- Pin your plan with the #### blending method.\n- Switch and encrypt the letters, then change the letters to the original ciphertext. \n- Apply the magic formula that can wipe out the whole input ciphertext only with the letter ‘M’.\n\n### Question:\nPlease execute the Cipher2000 script by running the main() function defined within the following file: \"Cipher2000.py\".\nInput the plaintext \"CW\".\nOutput the ciphertext sequence \"MSVS\".\n\n### Answer:\n\n\n# avg ass pt # 29.00 bromelk-kiambu\n\n```python\n# Please paste the script you developed for Task 5 in proper function definition order and place brackets at the beginning and end of your program in the file \"Cipher2000.py\".\n\ndef translateTexts(word): \n  e = {'T': 1, 'E': 3, 'A': 4} \n  m = {'M': 6, 'S': 2, 'V': 5} #Choose letters rather than numbers .\n  #for a look up table using iteration.\n\n  outString = ''\n  actualNum = 0\n  \n  for i in word:\n    if i == 'E':\n      outString = outString + str(m[i])\n    else:\n      outString = outString + str(e[i])\n      actualNum = actualNum + 4\n    \n  min = actualNum\n  max = 5 \n  secretGenerated = []\n  for i in outString:\n    if i == min:\n      secretGenerated.append(i)\n      min = min - 1\n  for j in outString:\n    if j == max:\n      secretGenerated.append(j)\n      max = max + 1\n      \n  for k in secretGenerated:\n    outString = outString.replace(k, '-').replace('St','St-').replace('Sk','Sk-').replace('Sa','Sa-').replace('Sm','Sm-').replace('Vs','Vs-').replace('Vt','Vt-')\n    #If a results in a give and take.

However, your program does not get enough sleep. Therefore, you have learned from the long Plaza about configurations and functionalities to use in conjunction with strips of code. \n\nBeside directly replacing the generated characters, there are variable controllers to modify the number of characters to use cyclical mapping. \n\n### Cycles: \n- 100|99|98 can be mapped to 0|1|2.\n- 50|39|30|10| ...|1| is a good choice.\n\n\n### Use the declared program to generate a list of characters from ‘0’-‘a’, when the cycle is 100.\n\n### Instructions:\nDeclare the variables \"letters\" and \"Places\".\nSet the dec enjoyed the largest daily virtual freedom?\n\n\n **Letters:**\n\n **Places (placeholder):**\n\n### Question:\n\nPrint out a list of all letters 0-a, and use 300 values in the place column.\n\n### Answer:\n\n```\n['A', 'C', 'E', 'F', 'H', 'K', 'P', 'R', 'T', 'U', 'X', 'Y']\n```\n\n### Question:\n\nPrint also another list of all letters 0-a, by setting the place to 300. Also, within the loop, use the ignore flag twice. \n\n### Answer:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Tag the testing framework to use and describe each field as needed for successful execution.\n- Fixes are necessary for all failing tests before submission of this stage. *Exceptions should be made for packages that are currently awaiting pull requests.*\n- Don't create duplicate cases already provided.\n- Keep names unambiguous so reviewers can generalize the provided results.\n- Supply inputs and expected outputs for each field type when an exact match is not practical.\n- Avoid excessive parentheses when testing multiple arguments.\n- Make use of lowercase letters `a-z`, uppercase letters `A-Z`, numeric characters `0-9`, and special characters; when appropriate, use `_` to replace spaces.\n- Test against the smallest, longest, start and end measures to check for potential edge cases.\n\n### Plaintext Rule:\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z).\n    - Seed: A number between 0-16.\n    - Format: \"Plaintext\", \"Key\", \"Seed\", \"Format\".\n    - Example: \"Cthulhu\", \"crying\", 7, \"Plaintext\"\n- Languages: Ruby, Javascript, Java\n- Python needs decimal numbers for numbers larger than 1000; use \"[flintstone](https://uricomplex.enlgtsml.com/flip?type=plain&id=Py_43103)\" next to the number for convenience. This is applicable to all languages listed in this step.\n\n**Tests Against Python User Input:**\n```\n\"swfgr|U+2M5|abcdefg\" should return \"FGLTV\"\n`\"swfgr\"+x\"U+2M5\"|pyeval should return \"FGLTV\"\n``swfgr+U+2M5`` should return \"FGLTV\"\n```\n\n**Tests against Python Annotations:**\n- Given no changes, plaintext should be converted into same format as the key.\n- Convert with 5 spaces at the end of ans.\n- The s encapsulation assignation must be performed into \\1,2 correspondingly with the appropriate number.\n- The period [.], semicolon [;] and tilde [~] characters must not be converted.\n\n## Step 3: Write Fixes (lucasad/plaintext/step3)\n\n### Further Instructions:\n\n- Try to solve and implement the mistakes by the first week deadline. This includes the surprise faults given out during the first week.\n- Only do two faults each week and do not guess what the fourth set of faults are for it will be provided as needed in a later week.\n- For lessons 1 & 2, try to make the test closely resemble the \"Other\" example provided during deliberations.\n- In addition, please provide code documentation for each component used in a fix.\n\n## Step 4: Release Your Program\n\nRepositories:\n- [Standard Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext)\n- [Surprise Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext)\n- [Instructions Plaintext](https://github.com/lucasad/plaintext/blob/step2-decrypt/instructions/plaintext.md)"}

The Crypt1 created in the first repository [is 100% the same Cryptocipher encryption used](https://board.cryptography.fandom.com/wiki/Cryptocipher). I always start at the end solving known problems. I cracked the hash below as crc-32 given the latest hash on the CRYPTO Cryptocipher page and compared to Laras's book:\n\n```\n*** $ hexdump with sha256sums ***\n00000000  2a 30 43 2c 31 4c 2c 20  26 26 20 22 3a 22 29 0a  |0C,1L, &'\":)..|\n00000010  0a 22 0a 2f 3a 3a 38 2f  80 54 37 2c 6a 2c 6a 93  |.|./:8/..T7,j,j.|\n00000020  6d 94 6d 94 6d 94 6d 94  6e 0a 3d 2d 2d 22 20 54  |m.m.m.n.=..\".T|\n00000030  3e 3e 79 3b 2d 23 df e0  bd 65 0f 03 3f 6b 53 76  |>>y;-#.#.e..?kSv|\n00000040  ba 12 60 46 c3 51 4d 8b  85 4e 25 84 4a 50 28 ac  |..`F.QM..N%..JP(.|\n00000050  83 3e d9 78 0f 6c e7 0a  c5 86 7e 06 37 2a 0a 04  |.>..x.l.. ..7*..|\n00000060  37 6c af 23 25 08 06 00  00 6d d2 50 68 66 98 3e  |7l.%...m.Phf.>.|\n00000070  cd 5c 64 3e c9 98 90 9c  1b f5 ca bd a9 f9 b4 7e  |\\d>....... ..|\n00000080  b2 b1 a3 31 64 8b f3 99  52 91 2a 78 e3 4b 73 07  |...1d...R.*x.Ks.|\n00000090\n```\n\n## 🔨 Challenger\n\n<NAME>\n\n## ⏳ Time to Solve\n\n1:03:44\n\nI started here thoomps as normally the md5 was not used for encryption. it makes an exceptional marker. I predicted at the 90℅ mark there that the algorithm was pioneered by <NAME> using the CRYPTO cipher I submitted a starter guess. With no guidance however I had to discover the first part of the message:\n\n> wp3Nxd964n=='\n\nAnd had to brute it instead of just going for the salt which by Blitz's design should be:\n\n> wp3Nxd964n==Aospace+\n\nAfter some time over and after backtracking to the forsha256sum.pub partition a Persona in Laras book [Or are they system users??] stands out by making remarkable dictums."}

Given a specific problem the goal is to assess which model is the best performing and provide it's prediction results.\n\n### Task\nFor this task you should implement 4 models: Regression by Blinding Glass [1], Random Forest Regression [2], Gradient Tree Boosting Regression [3] and Golden Animal Regression Model [4]. \n\nYou can iteratively get predictions based on separate folds or using cvsplit option for each of the models. Also, it is possible to use a single test data for the 6th model as well. Finally, as a complication challenge you can predict a % for each row that represents the accuracy/error. For example, the ith row of the predicted score should be followed by the string \"%.2f%%\" % (1.0 - (accumulated_error[i] / total_accuracy) * 100 ). For example, the following command line:\n\npython run_simulator.py predict foo_test_set.tsv -m\nBlinding-overfit --model_type=single_forest -o\nThis will produce a csv file that also contains the % accuracy/error for the each row.\n\nConsidering that we have 2000 samples this should produce a not very large csv file, for example:\n\ncol1,col2,col3,col4,col5 ,accuracy_error_%\nsample1_id,0.02752121729,0.03926300894,0.43513002092,0.30818488046,-8.436469481717316%\nsample2_id,0.21728564019,0.0303175483,0.383144611169,0.34849247355,3.7031404908763926%\nand so on.\n\n1.

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules. The “s_k_n” is a different scheme. The scheme is forenced and the specific encrypt rule is not specified here.\n        \n     \"s_k_n\":340277644805373023] #you can simply use it exactly as in the rule\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \" $S:56M)Ù*z_¿J:MzÄÃ<!--ï\\Eâ‚‚ßâ‰£7â��së)>27S?â��ø$s<xázüùøïœÒé ╯\\à?[^üÿó€ÕâˆÎʹ��{よう<Ｈ１鬏f✐Fw����dE\u0017W+kX xÀFNéŸ$UÌ@*æ'8rןh4µαkT^).j0zìYVÈYýÚ?Ţ�̚\\g#ï6}‡��A�.%Áy쌋T*櫓[^Öh¿ʘ„0∞? qè^[دؤ„̇$ݫTê.C⧻°YçY¦ŞÑó¹ȂÈπ/gŇÂ\u0018֠_]Җc�ٴîò'%™ŋ˩\u0003'):574726143556022745 secs; %b=3 1“’C\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[ get ciphertext without key,\n\n\t\tfor(int i=0;i<1134;i++)\n            {\n\t\t\t\tcipherText.append(\" \" + (((int)(((double)key[i]) * ((double)key[i + 1])))));  //store sub key.You should process key and store the their values in keyarray.\n            }\n\t\t]var  int g=1;\n\t\tint gadd++;\n\t\t]\n\t\t{//store ((double)((double)key[i]) • ((double)key[i + 1])) in subarray\n\n\t\t\tfor(int k = 0;k<1154;k++)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tint s=(((key[k])^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))))%(255>>5);\n\t\t\t\t//{key[k]^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))MOD(255stery5);\n\t\t\t\t// }gadd=0;\n\t\t\t\t// g=g->g[isasan][sub]->g[key]\n\t\t\t\tfor(int n=0;n<25745;n++) //loop key\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t//key++;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t}//*/"}

As an experiment, the NSF's Educational Research Information Boards wants to make their website secure. For this, ERIB has already hired cryptographers. They’ve provided you with their algorithm, which is VeraStyle’s cipher. An online encryption tool will be build, and visitors to ERIB’s website will be encouraged to enter their secure code. The Encryption function on your app will be called the \"AES function.\" You can use the SHA256 function. Both Alphanumeric Strings (Int8 [] or UInt8 []) and HEX values are acceptable. Encryption and decryption outcomes should match those of the following online tool: http://darpa.dtic.mil/ciphers/misc/iv.html\n\nThere is one catch, however. Each time the SHA256 operation is performed, a new \"key\" is generated. The actions you’ll perform are:\n\nInput: Plain Text; Padding is set to first, word length between 5 and 32 characters\nOutput:  = ArrayBuffer[], the hex value of your work DF08 E3E0 8244 017A 02E4 8884 294C\n\nGo to http://dtic.mil/ciphers/misc/iv.html to see how to encode and decode using the SHA256 algorithm.\n\nGreetings to the Language of Grace...."}
