Let's evaluate its truth values under assignments:\n\n- Assign p1 & p2 as \u2713: This formula becomes ~(\u2713=::>\u2713)&\ufffd indulge_insults\u231a. The compound proposition within the ~ is \u2713=::>\u2713, which is false because p1 =::> p2 would mean p2 must be true when p1 is true, but here p2 is false. Therefore, the whole formula is false.\n\n- Assign p1, p2 as x: This formula becomes ~(x=::>x)&x. The compound proposition within the ~ is x=::>x, which is true because if p1 is false, then p2 remains false. Therefore, the whole formula is also true. \n\nSince the formula is neither true under all assignments (first case) nor false under all assignments (second case), it is a Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question.\n\nFor the second sub-question, the formula is (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2). The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is true only when p1 is false, p3 is true (or p1 is true & p2 is false). So, the formula becomes (~p1&~p2). This formula is constantly false because p1 is necessarily false, and hence p2 always remains true in every assignment. Therefore, the formula is a Truth Formula for the second sub-question.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[B;A] (Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question, Truth Formula for the second sub-question)."}

If the principal CNF includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, then A is a tautology, and if it doesn't contain any paired conjunctive term, A is a contradiction. Here's the principal conjunctive normal form for A:\n\nmB \u2227 mC\n\nSo, A is denoted as [mB,mC]. Remember to leave the brackets [] empty if applicable, and combine the terms in the list according to the clauses. In this case, we have:\n\n[mB,mC] = [mB] \u2227 [mC] = {p0,q0,r0,s1, p0,q0,r1,s0} \u2227 {p0,q1,r1,s1, p0,q1,r1,s0, p1,q1,r1,s1} = {p0,q0,r1,s0}\n\nTherefore, A is a basic and tautological formula since it has only one paired conjunctive term mB \u2227 mC in its principal CNF and includes all 2^4 paired conjunctive terms."}

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad.

The updated S0 and S2 sets are:\n\nS0 = {@@, diastolic={@(q \u2228 p)}\nS2 = {@(q), @(q \u2228 p), @(q \u2228 p \u2228 q)}\n\nNow, we resolve the clauses in S1.\n\n  S1 = {@(q), @(q \u2228 p), @(p \u2227 q)}\n\nThe combinations of clauses that can be resolved are @(q \u2228 p) and @(p \u2227 q).

As neither empty set nor one of the initial sets contains @(p), we add it to S2:\n\nS2 = {@(q), @(q \u2228 p), @(p \u2227 q), @(p)}\n\nAfter the first loop iteration, S2 contains @(p) and @(q \u2228 p). The final check in the algorithm will verify if S2 is empty, which isn't the case in this example. Thus, the algorithm will add S1 to S0 and clear S2 as follows:\n\nS0 = {@@, diastolic={@(q \u2228 p), @(p \u2227 q)}\nS1 = {@(p \u2227 q), @(p)}\nS2 = {@(q)}\n\nThe refreshed sets will pass the first loop iteration, and the resolution algorithm will continue. Since S2 now only contains clause @(q), we'll output \"Implausible\" and terminate the calculation. The correct output for the given input is \"Implausible\"."}

If one is true, the other may be true or false, but if one is false, the other may be true or false. In this case, since Inspector C says that \"some\" individual businesses paid taxes, and Inspector A says that \"no individual businesses\" paid taxes, we know that neither all nor none of the individual businesses paid taxes. Therefore, the best relationship between Inspector A and Inspector C is & (AND), which represents the fact that both propositions are not entirely accurate, but their combination leads to a more accurate conclusion.\n\nNote that the relationship between A (Universal Affirmative) propositions and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions also follows the [# (or) relationship. If one proposition is true while the other is false, a \"true or false\" situation arises. However, in this case, we know that both Inspector A and Inspector C are not entirely accurate, so the most appropriate relationship is the & (AND) relationship, not [# (or)].\n\nLastly, the relationship between A (Universal Affirmative) propositions and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions also follows the % (bilateral) relationship. If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is also true (iliciting a \"true or true\" situation). However, in this case, since we know that Inspector A's proposition is \"no individual businesses paid taxes,\" we also know that not all individual businesses paid taxes. Therefore, Inspector A and Inspector C are consistent in conclusion and follow the % (bilateral) relationship."}

Here is the argument in the given format:\n\n[[II; EAE]; [Mood]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The first given logical statement is, \"\u2200P\u21d2\u00acM\" or \"For all P, if P, then not M\". This corresponds to the IAI figure and the valid mood is EAE.\n\n2. The second given logical statement is, \"\u2203S\u21d2M \u21d2 \u2203S\u21d2\u00acP\" or \"There exists S such that if S, then M, and this implies that there does not exist an S such that if S, then P\". This statement does correspond to any of the given figures (I, II, III, or IV). But, it does satisfy the syllogism where the major premise captures the \"\u2203S\u21d2M\" and the minor premise captures the \"\u2203S\u21d2\u00acP\", which both imply \"\u00acM\".\n\n3.

In this case, the \"if-if\" applies to the logical implements Gp (the future point of time) and the negation of its complement G\u00acp (which refers to the past point of time).

The inner expression will return `1` if either `c1` or `c2` will be true (i.e., if their `\u03c6` parts would be true), and `0` otherwise. The outer expression will then use the OR operator to determine if either of the inner expressions is `1`. This results in a yes/no answer of whether executing `c1` or `c2` would make `\u03c6` necessarily true.\n\nIn the final [c1 + c2] expression, we can utilize the addition operator to represent each of them separately, since the result would be equivalent to doing `[c1] + [c2]`, as per the Concurrent Rule."}

They observed that as water temperature increases, the duration a person can survive in the water increases as well. Similarly, as water temperature decreases, the duration a person can survive in the water decreases. This relationship between water temperature and duration suggests that there is a causal link between the two.\n\n- E. \u2698 method as the information provided about the causal relationships of water temperature, insulating swimsuits, and the length of time that people stay in water, suggests that there is a causal link between water temperature, insulating swimsuits, and the length of time that people stay in water. It indicates that the creation of better insulating swimsuits will enable people to stay in cold water for longer periods, which, in turn, is influenced by water temperature. However, applying the \u2698 method directly by verifying cosmological, temporality, anduality criteria is not fully possible, as it requires more extensive testing with different insulation suits and water temperature conditions."}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.

Perhaps there's an inference of attribution, but the original statement doesn't involvestronger information that contradicts the purpose of communication, thus the baby crying in bed and the mother picking her up doesn't lead up to the stronger piece of information (the mother is the baby's mother). Therefore, the choice is A.

Indirect Argumentation Methods\n\n- Contra- Method: Indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one. For example, proving the necessity of improving scientific and cultural levels by negating the contrary proposition that \"party and government leaders do not need to improve their scientific and cultural levels.\"\n- Elim- Method: Indirectly determining the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities related to the original proposition as false. For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\nWhen it is necessary to prove whether an integer is even or odd:\n\nSuppose n is an integer.\n\n**Case 1: n is even**\n\nIf n is even, it can be expressed as n=2k, where k is an integer. According to the definition of even numbers, n is divisible by 2.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\n\nIf n is odd, it can be expressed as n=2k+1, where k is an integer. According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given argument uses the [[D.Case+ Method]] to prove whether an integer is even or odd.
