According to our rule:\n\n1. If a is a multiple of b (14 is not a multiple of X, assuming X is smaller than 14 as both numbers must be integers and 14 being greater):\n   a※b = 24\n\n2. This directly matches our situation.

Since we're provided that X※14 = 5, it's contradictory, and based on the rules given, it should be 24. However, if we consider an error in the given information and follow the rule:\n\nX※14 = 24\n\nThere's no operation that can adjust 24 to equal 5, implying there's either a mistake in the question or an incorrect assumption.

Since 25 and 5 are multiples of each other (25 = 5 * 5), we use the first rule: a※b = a/b + 2. \n   So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Now we have 7※X = 4. We need to consider the rule based on whether X is a multiple of 7 or not.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7\nSince the rule states that if a is not a multiple of b (7※X from our previous step), then a※b = 24, but that cannot be true since our current result 7※X is already 4, not 24. So, X cannot be a multiple of 7.\n\nCase 2: X is not a multiple of 7\nUnder this assumption, the rule would imply that 7※X = 24. However, this contradicts our earlier result of 7※X equal to 4.\n\nSince neither assumption works, there seems to be a contradiction. Here's the key: The operation rule only applies when the first part of the operation (7※X) results in a fractional number. Since we already have 7※X equal to 4 (a whole number), we can't apply the operation to get a result of 4.\n\nTherefore, within the given operation rules, there is no value of X that would satisfy the expression 25※5※X=4.

We can first check if a number (X+3) could be part of a pair of factors that multiply to give 63:\n\nFactors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63.\n\nGiven that (X+3) is part of the factor (X+14), we can rule out 1 and 3 since they are too small.\n\nTrying 7:\n(7+3) = 10, (10+14) = 24, and 24 * 7 = 168 which is not equal to 63.\n\nTrying 9:\n(9+3) = 12, (12+14) = 26, and 26 * 9 = 234 which is not equal to 63.\n\nThis does not seem like an integer solution. Next, let's set up the quadratic equation:\n\n(X^2 + 12X + 32)(X + 14) = 63\nExpanding the left side:\n\nX^3 + 14X^2 + 168X + 448 = 63\n\nSubtract 63 from both sides:\n\nX^3 + 14X^2 + 168X + 448 - 63 = 0\nX^3 + 14X^2 + 168X + 385 = 0\n\nNow, we have a cubic equation:\n\nX^3 + 14X^2 + 168X + 385 = 0\n\nSolving this cubic equation exactly can be quite complicated without a calculator, and there are no clear integer solutions visible. Let's try a numerical approach by making assumptions and validating them:\n\nWe are looking for a real integer solution, and due to the structure of the equation, the roots may not be standalone integer solutions. To simplify, we can attempt to check if the integer values for X could lead to a cubic repeatedly getting close to 63.\n\nAfter experimenting with possible values, let's assume X = -1 (as negative values were mentioned are acceptable):\n\n(-1)^3 + 14(-1)^2 + 168(-1) + 385\n-1 + 14 - 168 + 385 = 220, which is not 63.\n\nSo, -1 is not the solution. There is no quick, manual way to pinpoint what this integer would be in this scenario, as the equation suggests that X isn't a simple integer.\n\nLet's make an assumption that there may not be an integer solution given the complexity of solving the cubic equation, and it would be either a fraction, with roots expressible in the form of a radical, or complex numbers, neither of which is acceptable by the rules of the problem. Thus, the answer would logically be:\n\n[[No integer solution]]"}

By factoring, we get:\n\n(X - 9)(X - 16) = 0\n\nThe possible values of X are 9 and 16. However, since X must be positive and the operation involves both an exponentiation and a square root, we need to check which value fits our initial operation:\n\nFor X = 9:\n9^1 + \\sqrt{9*1} = 9 + 3 = 12\n\nFor X = 16:\n16^1 + \\sqrt{16*1} = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nBetween the two, only X = 9 satisfies the original equation.
