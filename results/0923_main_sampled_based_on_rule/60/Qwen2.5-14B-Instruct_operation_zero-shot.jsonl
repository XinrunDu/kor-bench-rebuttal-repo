We are essentially solving for X in (3¥X)¥6=-1.\n\nFirst, let's define an intermediate result Y where Y = 3¥X. The equation becomes Y¥6=-1. We can use the operation a¥b to express this as Y^6 - 6^Y = -1.\n\nTo find X, we need to find a Y first that satisfies this equation before reversing the steps to find X from Y=3¥X=a^b-b^a for a=3 and some positive integer b=X.\n\nTesting values for Y:\n- If Y=5, then 5^6 - 6^5 = 15625 - 7776 = 7849, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=4, then 4^6 - 6^4 = 4096 - 1296 = 2800, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=3, then 3^6 - 6^3 = 729 - 216 = 513, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=2, then 2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=1, then 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=0, then 0^6 - 6^0 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nSo, Y = 0 satisfies Y¥6 = -1.\n\nNext, we need to find X where Y = 3¥X = 0.

This represents the symmetric difference between two sets A and B, which consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\n2. **Sets Definition:**\n   - A = {x | x is a real number} = R (all real numbers)\n   - B = {x | x^2 < 1} = (-1, 1) (all real numbers whose square is less than 1, i.e., between -1 and 1).\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n   - **A ∪ B:** The union of A and B is A itself, since A already includes all real numbers, including those in B. So, A ∪ B = R.\n   - **A ∩ B:** The intersection of A and B is B itself, since B is a subset of A. So, A ∩ B = (-1, 1).\n\n   Now, the symmetric difference A ￡ B = (A ∪ B) − (A ∩ B) = R - (-1, 1).\n\n4. **Resulting Set:**\n   The resulting set describes all real numbers except those in the interval (-1, 1). Mathematically, this is represented as the union of two intervals: one from negative infinity to -1 and another from 1 to positive infinity. \n\nTherefore, A ￡ B = (-∞, -1] or [1, ∞).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n[[(-∞,-1] or [1,∞)]]"}

This means it includes all the elements that are in A or B but not in both at the same time.\n\nGiven A={x | x is a natural number} and B={x | x is positive}, we see that both A and B are essentially the set of positive integers since natural numbers are either the set {1, 2, 3, ...} or, in some definitions, {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. However, in the context of the postive condition, both A and B can be considered equal, containing all positive integers {1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\n- **A∪B** represents the union of A and B, which here is simply the set of all positive integers since A and B are the same in terms of content.\n- **A∩B** represents the intersection of A and B, which is again the set of all positive integers because every element in A is in B, and vice versa.\n\nSince A and B are identical, their union and intersection are identical as well. When we perform the symmetric difference A￡B, we are determining elements in A or B but not in both, upon consideration of their identical nature, the set of elements not in both sets coincides with zero or nothing, i.e., the result is an empty set.\n\nThus, the result of A￡B is [[{}]]."}
