Given these nested conditions, this formula fits into the Z+n category, where n describes how much beyond Z the complexity goes.

It is False if p1 is True (T) and p2 is False (F).\n- Therefore, \"~(p1=::>p2)\" would be True if p1 is True and p2 is False, and False otherwise.\n- Then, combining with \"p2\", the formula would be:\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is False (because \"(~(T=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is False and p2 is False (because \"(~(F=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - True when p1 is False and p2 is True (because \"(~(F=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is True (because \"(~(T=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n\nBased on this analysis, the formula is not true under all assignments and not false under all assignments. So it is Neither.\n\n### Formula 2: (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"(p1 & p3)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p3 are True. It is False otherwise.\n- The part \"(~p1 & ~p2)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p2 are False. It is False otherwise.\n- Therefore, we need to check if the conditions for truth of \"(p1 & p3)\" match the conditions for truth of \"(~p1 & ~p2)\". They clearly don't match under any assignment because the conditions for both being True or False require opposite states of p1.\n\nGiven the contradictory requirements to make both parts of the equivalence true or false under the same conditions, it's clear this formula doesn't hold true for any assignment neither does it hold false for all assignments under every possible state of truth for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nBased on this, the formula should be classified as Neither.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n[[C];[C]]"}

Convert the implications into the form that uses `|` and `!`:\n   - Implication \\(A > B\\) is equivalent to `!A | B` based on the rule given.\n   - Therefore, the first expression \\((p>q)>r\\) is equivalent to `!(p>q) | r`.\n\n2. Apply the rule \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\) to `!(p>q) | r`:\n   - \\((p > q) ::=:: !p | q\\).\n   - So, `!(p>q)` is `!!(p>q)` and `p>q ::=:: !p | q`, which becomes `!(<!p | q)`.\n\n3. Simplify `!(<!p | q)` using the double negation rule \\(A ::=:: !!A\\):\n   - `!(<!p | q)` is equivalent to `\\(\\neg(\\neg(!p | q))\\)` which simplifies to `!(p & !q)` using De Morgan's Law (!(\\(A\\) | \\(B\\)) ::=:: !A & !B).\n\n4. Therefore, `!(p & !q) | r` is further simplified to `(!p | !!q) | r` and then to `(!p | q) | r`.\n\n5. We'll now do the same for the second expression \\(p>(q>r)\\) which is equivalent to `p> (!q | r)` following the same conversion rule.\n   - This implies `!p | (q>r)` or `!p | ((!q | r))`.\n   - Further simplification gives us `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\n6. Now we simplify both expressions further and compare:\n   - The first expression `(!p | q) | r`.\n   - The second expression `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nApplying commutative and associative properties:\n   - `(!p | q) | r ::=:: !p | q | r` (since `|` is associative and commutative).\n   - `!p | (!q | r) ::=:: !p | !q | r`.\n\nComparing `!p | q | r` and `!p | !q | r`, we can see they are not the same because the second part does not match. Therefore, the original expressions \\((p>q)>r\\) and \\(p>(q>r)\\) are not equivalent.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]]."}

Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4. From the identity of AND with a true statement, we know that p&1 is logically equivalent to p itself.\n5. Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8. Thus, this equivalence cannot be universally proven as valid according to the given equivalences rules since the right-hand side simplifies to a contradiction which does not capture the variability of the left-hand side correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A];[B]]"}

By equivalence (16), \\(p\u21d3q ::=:: !p & !q\\).\n2. Let's replace the NOR operations with AND operations: \\((p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: (!p & !q)\u21d3r\\).\n3. Using the equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p & !q) & !r\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\(!!p | !!q & !r\\).\n5. Using equivalence (1) (\\(A ::=:: !!A\\)), this simplifies further to \\(p | q & !r\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand side.\n1. By the same process, \\(q\u21d3r ::=:: !q & !r\\).\n2. Thus, \\(p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) ::=:: !p & !(q\u21d3r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d3r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5. Simplifying again using equivalence (1), we get \\(!p & (!q | r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) \\) translates to \\(p | q & !r ::=:: !p & (!q | r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p\u21d1q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: (!p | !q)\u21d1r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) \u21d1 r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)\u21d1r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6. Applying De Morgan's law, this simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\), which further simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n\nFor the right-hand side:\n1. \\(q\u21d1r ::=:: !q | !r\\).\n2. So, \\(p\u21d1(q\u21d1r) ::=:: !p | !(q\u21d1r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d1r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p | !(!q | !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p | (q & r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\\) translates to \\((p | q)\u21d1r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\), or more accurately, \\(!(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent either.

This expression already is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) because it is the disjunction of two basic conjunction terms. The next step is to identify the true assignments that make these conjunctions true and then denote them according to the given rules.\n\nThe expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) simplifies to \u00acp^r because for the conjunction \u00acp^\u00acq^r to be true, p must be false and r must be true. Similarly, for \u00acp^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true. Thus, the simplified expression highlights that p needs to be false and r needs to be true for the overall expression to be true, irrespective of the value of q.\n\nLet's represent the true assignment for \u00acp^\u00acq^r:\n- If p is false (binary value = 0), q can be false or true (binary value = 0 or 1), and r must be true (binary value = 1).\n\nThe true assignments that satisfy the given expression are:\n1.

The expression is (p\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2228r) and we are looking for inputs which would result in the output \"-\".

(p \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr): This term is true only when p, q are true and r is false.\n2. (\u00acp \u2227 q): True only when p is false and q is true, regardless of r.\n3. (p \u2228 r): True whenever p or r or both are true.\n\nFor the output \"O\" to be \"-\", the entire expression must be false, so all three terms must be false. Thus, we need:\n1. (p \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) false: p false OR q false OR r true.\n2. (\u00acp \u2227 q) false: p true OR q false.\n3. (p \u2228 r) false: p false AND r false.\n\nCombining all conditions:\n- For the first term, we can have p false, r true, or q false (or any combination of these, but it's useful to keep it minimal).\n- For the second term, p must be true or q false.\n- For the third term, both p and r must be false.\n\nGiven the third term being false (p and r both false), the only way the second term can be false is if q is false.\n\nTherefore, the following inputs [[p=false, q=false, r=true]], [[p=false, q=false, r=false]], and any other combinations aligning exactly with these conditions will satisfy the requirement such that the expression output is \"-\".\n\nGiven these findings and ensuring adherence to the format:\n\n```\n[[false;false;true];[false;false;false]]\n```\nThis format adheres to the instructions, indicating two possible sets of inputs that could result in the specified output state."}

A non-empty set of entities \ud835\udc38;\n2. Each entity constant a in \ud835\udc40 has a corresponding entity a\u2032 \u2208 \ud835\udc38, referred to as the assignment of a in \ud835\udc3d;\n3. Each \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbol \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc40 has a function g\ud835\udc3d, known as the implementation of \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc3d;\n4. Each \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbol \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc40 has a relation R\ud835\udc3d, known as the implementation of \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc3d.\n\nFormulas \ud835\udc35 under interpretation \ud835\udc3d:\n1. Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38;\n2. Replace entity constants a in \ud835\udc35 with a\u2032;\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with g\ud835\udc3d;\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\n\nThe resulting formula is denoted as \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3d, termed as the implementation of \ud835\udc35 under \ud835\udc3d.\n\n### Question:\n(a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n(b) a\u2032 = 2.\n(c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n(d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nWrite down the implementation of the following formulas under J:\n(1) \u2200x\u2200y\u2203zF(f(x,y),z)\n(2) \u2203xF(f(x,y),g(x,z)\n\nPlease provide the answer in [[];[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the problem as per the given rules, we must interpret each formula under the interpretation provided. Let\u2019s break it down for each given formula:\n\n1. The formula \\( \\forall x\\forall y\\exists z F(f(x,y),z) \\) means that for every pair of numbers (x, y), there is some number z such that function f applied to x and y equals z. Considering the definitions, we can replace the symbols with their corresponding implementations under J:\n    - \\( f(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x + y \\)\n    - \\( F(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x = y \\)\n\nTherefore, the formula under J becomes a statement about natural numbers. Each output of \\( f(x, y) \\) yields a pair (x + y, z) that satisfies \\( x + y = z \\) under FJ, where \\( x, y, z \u2208 N \\).\n\n2. The formula \\( \\exists x F(f(x, y), g(x, z)) \\) suggests there exists a number x such that the function f of x and y equals the function g of x and z. Under the transitions provided:\n    - \\( f(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x + y \\)\n    - \\( g(x, z) \\) is replaced with \\( x * z \\)\n    - \\( F(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x = y \\)\n\nThus, \\( F(f(x,y), g(x,z)) \\) turns into a statement about a pair (x + y, x * z) that satisfies \\( x + y = x * z \\) under FJ, where x, y, z \u2208 N.\n\nPlacing the findings in the required format, we have:\n[\n  [1;For every \\(x, y \u2208 N\\), exists \\(z \u2208 N\\) such that \\(x + y = z\\)], \n  [2;There exists \\(x \u2208 N\\) such that \\(x + y = x * z\\), for some \\(y, z \u2208 N\\)]\n]"}

Therefore, they don't have a clear * relation as defined, and thus do not have a relationship based on the provided rules.\n- **[1] and [3]**: These two statements effectively make the same claim under different wording. \"[1] All products are qualified\" and \"[3] All products are not unqualified\" both express that all products are qualified (in the affirmative for [1] and in the negation of non-qualification for [3]). Since they express the same idea, they do have a relationship.\n- **[3] and [4]**: These statements do not have a relationship under the provided rules. Proposition [4] suggests that there exists a subset of products that are unqualified, whereas [3] denies that there are any unqualified products. While they might seem to be in contradiction, these do not fit into the * relation or any other specified relationship because they deal with an affirmative universal statement and a particular negative statement concerning the same subjects but opposing predicates."}

According to Method C:\n1. First, obversion is applied, changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary to result in \"All S is not non-P\", which would be \"All true revolutionaries are not not upright and open\". This step simplifies logically to \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" again since double negation cancels out.\n2.

The statement implies a necessity or a rule that science necessitates more than a single individual, considering it as a cooperative human endeavor. \n\nGiven that p denotes \"Science is a human endeavour,\" we cannot directly use p to symbolize \"Science is a one-man endeavour.\" Therefore, we need to understand that the proposition revolves around negating the possibility of science being a one-man endeavor, implying its necessity as a collective effort.\n\nTo symbolize, \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour,\" we should note that it rules out a specific possibility, which is not directly covered by our symbol p alone. However, under the constraints of the given logic, we can express it as an emphasis on the necessity of science as a broader endeavor involving more than one person, suggesting the negation of it being solely done by one, symbolically. Thus, it could be argued that we should focus on ruling out the possibility of science being confined to an individual effort, writing it as a negation of this isolated possibility:\n\n[[$!p]] \n\nThis is an interpretation suggesting that the necessity of a broader involvement in scientific work implies the impossibility of science being confined to a one-man endeavour, as it requires more than one person based on our symbolic logic provided. However, this solution requires a tentative interpretation due to the limitations in directly symbolizing \"one-man endeavour\" with the provided symbol p."}

Let p represent \"Team A did win the championship.\" The statement \"Team A did not win the championship\" can be written as !p.\n\nConsidering the modal truth reasoning formula 16: !p \u2192 $!p, it suggests that if p is false, then it is possible that p is false.\n\nThus, when Team A did not win the championship (!p), according to formula 16, it means $!p, which translates \"it is possible that Team A did not win the championship,\" indicating uncertainty but acknowledging the possibility of the negation of the statement.\n\nThe answer that aligns with $!p, acknowledging the possibility of Team A not winning, is option D.\n\n[[D]]"}

Given limitations and adhering as closely as possible, one could argue for symbolizing each part separately, but if it needs to stay within a single expression as per the format hint, we can offer the representation for just one of the aspects (evidently the format is possibly misaligned with accommodating multiple variables into a single slot as implied). \n\nFor a direct answer under the format constraint and taking p as an example:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"]]\n\nHowever, to adequately represent all parts:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"], [\"q\", \"\u203dq\"], [\"r\", \"\u203dr\"]]\n\nThis approach represents each part of the prohibition separately since the format hint is not specific on how to integrate multiple prohibitions into a single slot adhering to custom defined logic rules."}

However, this relationship does not stipulate any constraints that both propositions cannot be true, cannot be false, or must necessarily be in any exclusive state relative to truth or falsity as all four relationships imply differently. Since there is no inherent restriction on the possible truth values listed in the definitions of the * and x relationships, and it does not strictly necessitate that at least one of them must be true as per the @ relationship, it stands that the only defined relationship in our rule set that allows for both propositions to potentially be true and false is the % relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[D]]."}

Hence, Fp and \u00acG\u00acp.\n\nFor the second pair:\n3. \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" can be represented as Gp, indicating a future period.\n4. \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\" can be more loosely understood as Fp, a future point in time.\n\nNext, we match these interpretations to the given relationships to determine which one they fulfill:\n\nFor (1) - (2) relationships:\n- Fp and \u00acG\u00acp correspond to the relationship Gp \u2194 \u00acF\u00acp (which is rule 15). Therefore, they are related as in the rule (15).\n- Since the rules given do not provide an exact match for this derived relationship, we examine the complex relationships (\u203b, \u21a6, \u26ad, \u2042).\n\nSince Fp \u2194 \u00acG\u00acp does not directly tell us the type of relationship between Fp and \u00acG\u00acp, we can infer that Fp and \u00acG\u00acp follow the properties of the relationship between Fp and G\u00acp, which is not covered under the standards given directly. However, when considering the principles of (13) Gp \u2194 F\u00acp and by negation relationships, we deduce the contradicting but possible truth yet impossible falsity which points to a \u26ad relationship.\n\nFor (3) - (4) relationships:\n- Gp and Fp fall under the rule (21) Gp \u2192 Fp, which also indicates a future time point relationship. A bidirectional relationship not directly given but aligned with the future time points relationship among properties that can both be true or false, adhering to the nature of the future propositions which can lead to multiple interpretations but fits better within the type that does not state mutual exclusion (nor implies mutuality) fully but gives grounds to the truth and falsehood under posteriority or simultaneity which is \u2242 relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be:\n\n[[C];[D]]\n\nHowever, given the tight logical relationships and their persistence rules from the provided instructions, aligning the sentence to the rule should indeed overtly lean towards specific designation under which the direct match is needed. If no direct match, the best understood fit with given options married with deduced logical validity suggests the nature of properties.\n\nHence, considering the overarching principles [[C];[D]] gives the inferred relationship from available options aligning most logically."}

Since the question states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, this aligns with the notion of common belief.

This aligns with the understanding that having doubts about a proposition negates a firm belief in that proposition. Therefore, Alice is not convinced that the library is open today, nor is she convinced of its negation (that it's not open). Instead, she is in a state of not being certain, which corresponds to option C."}

The two hypotheses are (q_1) that the rats escape because of the light and (q_2) that the rats escape due to hearing a sound.

This means that regardless of whether p is true or false, q must be true. This scenario does not directly align with the definitions and rules of the BC Paradox or the LS Paradox, as they involve different logical structures and the conditions of their paradoxes do not match the given expression directly.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the GB Paradox, we see a parallel in using the same observation (in this case, q being true regardless of p's status) to draw the conclusion that q holds true. This can reflect a situation similar to the GB Paradox where the same outcome (q being true) can be derived from different conditions (p\u771f\u5047\u4e0d\u4e00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5), thus reflecting a situation where conclusions may appear to contradict each other from different viewpoints, even though they lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to the provided logical expression is the **GB Paradox** as it can illustrate a situation where the same conclusion (q being true) is approached from two different premises and can present complexity in conclusively favoring one form of inductive reasoning over another if not appropriately distinguished.\n\n[[A]]"}
