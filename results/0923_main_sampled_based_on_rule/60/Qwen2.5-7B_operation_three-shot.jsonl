Additionally, encourage students to explore different commands in the trial version, as it may have additional capabilities beyond circumradii and intersection radii.\n\nIf there are any other specific elements or commands within Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha trial that the students should be aware of or practice as part of this lesson, feel free to provide them too.\n\n### Question:\nCompute (14) & (8) + (5) $ (12).\nd) The answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[20]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (74) & (73) + (12) $ (1).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[75]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (2) & (3) + (8) $ (11).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\nThe answer with best timing should be considered.\n\n### Answer:\n[[12]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 2 & 8 + 4 $ 16.\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[16]]"}

So, we need to find X such that 6 - (10 $ X) = 3.\n\nCase 1: If X ≤ 10, then (10 $ X) = 10, so we have 6 - 10 = -4, which is not equal to 3.\nTherefore, X must be greater than 10.\n\nCase 2: If X > 10, then (10 $ X) = X, so we have 6 - X = 3.\nSolving for X, we get X = 6 - 3 = 3.

From the definition:\n\n- \\(a \\star b = \\sqrt{a} + b^2\\)\n- \\(a \\diamond b = \\sqrt{a} \\times b\\)\n\nGiven \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 3\\), let's apply these operations step by step:\n\n1. Compute \\(3 \\star 3\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\star 3 = \\sqrt{3} + 3^2\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the square root of 3.\n   - Then, add the square of 3 to it.\n\n2. Compute \\((3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 3^2) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\n   \\]\n   - Apply the diamond operation with \\(a = \\sqrt{3} + 9\\) and \\(b = 3\\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values step by step using clear and detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Compute \\(\\sqrt{3} + 3^2\\):\n   - The square root of 3 is approximately \\(1.732\\).\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 \\approx 1.732 + 9 = 10.732\\).\n\n2. Compute \\((\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\\):\n   - \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 = 10.732\\).\n   - The diamond operation gives us:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3 = 10.732 \\ota 3 = (10.732 \\otimes 3)\n   \\]\n   - Using the definition of the diamond operation:\n   \\[\n   10.732 \\perp 3 = 10.732 \\times 3 = 32.196\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = 32.196 \\]"}

The operation rule provided only applies to integer pairs (a, b) where a and b are integers. However, for a = 4 and b = 1, and for a = 2 and b = 3 as stated in the initial problem, the operation was performed using these integer pairs and resulted in 10 + 20i. For a = 11.7 and b = 1.2, we cannot apply the operation rule in the same manner because the rule specifically mentions integer pairs (a + bi)^2. Using real numbers would require a different operation or function, which is not defined in the given rule. Thus, the question is not applicable as stated within the given rule. Please clarify with 'integer' if you wish to proceed with integers only."}
