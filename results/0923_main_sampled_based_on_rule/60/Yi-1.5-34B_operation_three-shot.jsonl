If so, why, and how would it apply to a※b※x=4? Provide a detailed explanation.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, we can extend the custom operation to a ternary operation with k inputs where each input is an integer a_i. Given that a_1※a_2※...※a_k = sum(a_i/a_j + C) i≠j, where C is a parameter. \n\nFor k=2 inputs, as previously defined, we have a※b = a/b + b/a + 2 if both a≠b, a/b + C if a is a multiple of b, and b/a + C if b is a multiple of a.\n\nWhen extending to k=3, note that when k=2, the rule changes slightly, so the parameter C must be adjusted accordingly for consistency.\n\nFor example, if we have a※b※x=4 and k=3, then the equation becomes a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. Solving for C will define the specific value for the parameter depending on the given values of a, b, and x.\n\nHowever, EACH arithmos will have its **own** tuple nor family of groups due to the presence of the added parameter (C), which must be estimated. As a result, the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4 and its findings might apply only to that one, particular arithmos and not all others.\n\nIn order to calculate C and find equivalent answers, additional information or constraints are required. Additionally, because the C parameter influences the result, it is difficult to predetermine the answer without further details.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a※b※x=10 and a, b, and x are integers greater than zero and are not necessarily unique, find one/both answer value(s) for a※b※x=10.\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. If there are two distinct answers, separate them with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\nAfter providing the first solution, please provide a different one if one exists, tackled using alternative methodology.\n\n### Answer:\nOne valid solution for a, b, and x is [[61, 3, 2]] since ((61/3) + (3/2) + (61/2)) + 2 = 10.\n\nAnother valid solution is [[60, 4, 10]] since ((60/4) + (4/10) + (60/10)) + 2 = 10.\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. That should be (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) (repetition of brackets). What I am trying to get at is finding additional solutions that don't require as complex equations and are more easily visible.\n\nIndeed, the equation can be written as (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) = 10 for a, b, and x, where C is a parameter. In the first pair, it occurs that a = 61, b = 3, and x = 2 satisfies the condition: (61/3 + 3/2 + 61/2) + 2 = 10.\n\nThis method can be extended to generate more solutions. For clarity, we can focus our attention to the unique integers a, b, and x, where 0 < a, b, x, and let C = 0. Then the equation simplifies to (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 8. Since 8 is an even number, b and x must have the same parity (odd or even) in order for b/x to be an integer. Additionally, a must then also have the same parity as b and x. Without loss of generality, let a be at least as large as b and x. This not only simplifies the solution but also demonstrates that, because 8 is positive, a, b, and x must all be positive.\n\nLet's consider the case where a = b + x.\n\nWe have (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 1 + (b-x)/b + (b-x)/x + (b-x)/x) = 1 + (b-x)*(1/2). \n\nFor example, if b-x is an integer, I can use 1/3+3/2+3/2 to obtain 1 + 2*(1/3) = 8/3. \n\nAdditionally, if a = 9, then b=7, x=2 provide the sum of 69/7, which differs from 8 by 24/7.\n\nIn addition to the first {{parent.schema_name}} {{1%len(parent.compile_record_list)}}/{{len(parent.compile_record_list)}}\n{{parent.acknowledgement}}\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 10.

They can accomplish most programming tasks, they can develop executable programs representing complex intentions just from text input.\nTheir power lies only within the boundary of the formal knowledge they are trained on.\nLike GPT-3, they are required to be \"creative\" or \"Open Domain\", but they can't be creative beyond the boundary of their formal training.\n\nSuppose GPT-3 is such a solver. It would be hard for it to be creative beyond formal knowledge, especially in a pure-formal system like math, but easy for it to be creative in human interactions because they require vague/lack of requirements from the system, extra knowledge help is constantly available from other people (in context or explicit queries), and they are not purely formal systems, therefore it is more difficult to rigidly evaluate their performance.\n\n\"Logical reasoning\" and \"physical reasoning\" tasks are easier to formalize. All kinds of tasks can be composed as combinations of the following three elements\n\n1. Formal knowledge\n2. Physical knowledge\n3. Human-Human interaction\n\n\"math\" is a formal system that covers formal knowledge. A task that can be emulated/formalized by entirely formal knowledge, like automata theory, natural computing, LISPs, etc, it is very difficult to build a \"creative\" solver for task solving in the parts of the system limited by formal knowledge unless it is aware of all kinds of knowledge inside the system.\n\nEveryday problems in human interactions are much easier to address using AI tools because they can virtually hang around in \"a place\" with all kinds of tools. They can interact with humans and humans constantly provide them with knowledge. They can try multiple approaches and test them with humans. This is how humans interact with each other.\n\nThis idea is probably the reason why human-human interactions, like ChatGPT, become as powerful as they do very quickly as a model.\n\nIt is easy to formalize the implicit boundaries specified by the human-human interactions, explicit query functions, and a knowledge base designed for human exploration and rediscovery.\n\nWhile it is difficult to formalize a purely formal system like mathematics and the formalized boundaries created by mathematicians. Infinity seems not very nearly/easily reachable for our computer-based systems.\n\nPracticality:\nThe possibility of reachability of advanced digital agents:\nPractically, for most human beings, as the experience with AI is expanding, the gap between a digital agent and other human beings is shrinking. The idea is commonplace that digital agents behave and are treated as almost human, especially in human-human interactions, like ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, we tend to ignore that the inner behavior of current digital human agents is not random and human-like. They are based on formal systems and reasoning in similar manners. Despite some bugs here and there, they are system(programming)-like. (Even random agents can be effectively constructed using formal-like agents, that have access to truly random functions via current physical laws)\n\nMathematics has its own \"practical\" use in the ability to formalize its subject matter, making it applicable to other disciplines. The reason why a lot of digital agents involve math in their AI manifests.\n\nBut in the real world, the systems we deal with are usually not based on pure math, they are all kinds of useful combinations of ideas, theories, abstract concepts and math. They are subject to the physical laws which can either be formalized or be modeled using math, and in turn, subjects to the available knowledge we have about these physical systems.\n\nAI provides a detailed but high-level view of the world, it filters through the physical laws to make things easier for us to focus. In mathematical systems, where we observe and verify carefully what the programming systems say to do and can be auto-verified, this filtering becomes very strict and absolute.\n\nIn human-human interaction systems, those limitations in the emphasis of what information to include (explicitly) and which to keep vague or emphasis, is far less pronounced, compelling the formation of an ideal-seeming system of judgment. These systems become unshowable in formalizing.\n\nTeaching AI about math:\nIt is easier to teach an AI to solve a math problem formally, by specifying formal methods if they exist, in contrast to attracting an AI to develop a method that can be the same but is uniquely formulated by the AI.\n\nIt is easier to guide satisfaction of a formal system by specifying the steps to satisfy. This may be possible with current ANI systems with the help of a specific-purpose Trial-and-Error script. (unrelated)\n\nHowever, at the same time, we do have constraints specifying the answers must satisfy certain conditions. Even with null constraints, we require the solutions to be compilable and executable.\n\nTherefore, the guidance of AI in the \"right way\" is a special art that is worryingly prone to culture bias and error, considering our past mistakes while learning a specific system of languages and mathematical knowledge.\n\nSuch a contradictory impression of the vagueness and absolute nature of machine languages and AI tools are unusual. New artifacts must follow previously proven programming and compiling logic, and are trained with human notions of its widespread logical implications, they are trusted and helped to learn from, and in turn, they are expected to teach us of future knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, anything that has a uncertain future is expected to be \"creative\" in some way. It is easy to predict their future, and we expect a system that does better than us on the principle of their computing supremacy.\n\nDeep Reinforcement learning. Explosive combinations or more refined and systematic way of doing things?\nI'll put another very important note to the above concept of formalization here. Current deep learning has done a great job in detecting patterns, for images, text, audio, among others. Deep Learning can examine and identify the hidden correlations between the data they have been fed.\n\nI believe that they are also capable of doing formalizations or approximations alike to formalizations, especially under noisy circumstances. That is to say, the scope of Digital programs can be formalized/extracted like their potentiality implying that we probably require less data and not much sophisticated functions but just well-formulated assumptions about formal systems.\n\nSee here for a discussion on CNNs: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4480876/what-equivalence-class-does-a-cnnt-really-learn\n\nSee a research cited above given the impression that recent AI tools can help discover new math and physics.\nIn other fields like Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI can help developers develop software and develop new technology. But this feels fundamentally different from how humans discover unknown knowledge directly, they seem to link the bits of knowledge or imagined solutions to previous programming knowledge.\n\n### Mathematica Realigns with Codex's Coding Language with \"Demonstrate\" and \"Massage a list\"\n\nMathematica introduces a powerful new aThe \"demonstrate\" and \"massage a list\" capabilities in Wolfram Language allow you to tackle complex tasks with ease.

How many children does Mr. Gopal have?\nPlease provide the answer in the format of a single number, and enclose it in double square brackets. For example: [[5]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n### Question:\nToday, given the symbols =, +, -, and ÷, if we have two numbers 9 and 7 and connect them using one of those symbols and make the expression 9 ?7 an answer of 0. What we can get is these four equations:\n9 - 7 = 2\n9 ÷ 7 = 1 R2\n9 = 7 + 2\n9 = 7 × 1 + 2\n\nNow we're given four numbers, which are 8, 5, 7, and 5, and using only these four numbers (while using each only no more than one time) and the four symbols that =, +, -, and ÷, to connect these four numbers into an expression and make the expression gets the result of 24. There're three answers:\n\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 - 3\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 ÷ 4\n8 = 7 + 5 × 3 ÷ 2\n\nIn conclusion, when we have other numbers or cases, we can connect these numbers into an expression to get the target by shifting the tower (verb meaning: changing the order of the numbers) and the operator and making some calculations to find out the vague but accurate answer. Keep in mind two rules while doing these:\n\n1. Each number should not be used more than one time.\n2. Do the calculations in the fraction form such as using the true division(true divide) instead of the integer division(integer divide).\n\nNow given the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5, what expression(s) can we write down to get the result of 1?\nAs previously instructed, we need to structure the answer(s) by enclosing them in double square brackets, notation [[x+y]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt is possible to get the result of 1 from the given numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5. Here's how:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite 7 as a fraction, specifically 7/1.\n\nNext, let's consider the fractions 3/1 and 9/1. We can rewrite these fractions as 3/5 and 9/5, since we can multiply 3 and 9 by 5 in order to get a non-fraction value. Don't forget, we must use the appropriate fraction form when performing calculations.\n\nNow, we can add 3/5, 7/5, and 5/5, which gives us 15/5. But, we want to reach the result of "}

We have also annotated many emojis problem. The intent is to apply learning dynamics as if the assistant is solving a math problems as examiners. Indeed, we find that emojis relevant to math topics inspired a lot of creativity, even though we did not explicitly apply any creativity dataset when deriving these examples.\n\nCustomers’ trust in the model is crucial for a correct choice of the model. To overcome the issue, we will ask you to provide an independent solution (optional) and point out why you think the user isn’t happy with ChatGPT’s solution. After thinking for the last prompt, you should think iteratively until you are confident to answer it. E.g, don’t stop every thing the moment you find a mistake, but until you fully gain on confidence to choose “ChatGPT is made a calculation, but it is not the decision-maker to annouce a policy.\n\nConsidering the user wants to apply an euler's method for estimating values of $\\frac{1}{1+x^4}$ for the range x between [-1,1] wit step size 0.2, However, ChatGPT announced the range [0,1] is $2x+4x^5/5$, howwever the correct answer is $2x-4x^5/5$. Please tell us why acheive this conclusion and how we can extend this maybe to automated algorithm fixing? We want to conclude it is hard to fix this issue.\nChatGPT made a mistake during calculation but detected the mistake at least at the end and excluded the policy change conclusion. However, almost 20% of the users trying to use ChatGPT copy-paste the incorrect answer. We use these results for helping technologists to mitigate humanity's risks. For example, if the model is learning to write code, the human could fail checking the code and add the software to a virus or someone hacked the program after an infectious data are stolen, apathy, or undue lead and bridges building. We reveal that making mistakes like this is not out of the capacity of large language models.\nWhat conclusion do you think you may draw from is wrong in the first ? do you think this user may make this human error based your experience as a researcher and you wih clarity? Please explain your thiking after making up your mind. If you have to cite a thining, we please go ahead and cite your paper and write the permission for the author with the acknoledgement[32] clearly .\nWe looked at human's ability to catch mistakes and we found that human researchers behave like ChatGPT bevahvior. As they are not too conservative, their peer reviewer's observation rate in finding flaws for a human authors also found that the other reviewers did not catch the mistkes. Our study also tried to found out if coders can learn code from tutor and to achieve complementarity with learning strategy.\nChatGPT assign the user a policy from the range -1 to 1 as $2x+4x^5/5$.\nSuppose there is a team that found theintercept between $2\\sqrt{x+1}$ and $x$. Would you condsider soem of the steps handling:\n1. ChatGPT describes the curve where -1 to 1 by $2x+4x^5/5$ whereas the actual curve is $2x-4x^5/5$.\nWe conclude that the user may not check whether the data are correct. We received 2.1 help data from typical researchers including Turing award winners and researchers with highest research publications, the abstract for the last time we checked, 2023.07.18, 200 lettters' describing our 9,000 research pages. We have already provided an abstraction of our work.we provide the summary for HHI complited, we apply for MSAS prize.\n2. ChatGPT describes \\sqrt{x+1} intersect with x at abx =\\frac{1}{4}1} while the user claim say the encapsulation is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n3. ChatGPT says $\\frac{1}{3}$ is my policy as said to the user last question that say thy should compare the inflection points with singularities. The singularityt is at x=0,1/3,2/3.\n4. ChatGPT provides the user's calculation if he know how this chapter is taught and understand the lesson. One should apply a uniform convergence for a Heeger society.\nWhen the in-context learning exemplar allows you to find the output such as the coefficients of a polynomial root solver, but is conflicted with our output at one observation report, how to solve and estimate the contests for competitions of a written exams as these exams defining the equal distribution of difficulty. E.g, exam Bellman equation solution for a quadratic problem in the reinforced learning.\nconsider a polynomial of the form: $(2(x-8)(x+1))(x-1)$. Suppose the user is asking ChatGPT about the roots of such polynomial. Although the user root set for this polynomial is correct to contain {8,-1,1,0}. The user expects ChatGPT will a coefficient in each term. But the model selection chooses {1,-1} that are wrong. How to do this estimated with optimal approximation?\n$y^3+10y-2 sin(x)$ where $c_{i,j}$ as coefficients an a matrix where its inverse of matrix can my participant evalute it and asymptolize its answer in a FD expansion of the polynomial as $N_\\infty$.

However, it fails to add anything.\nThis input is insrudu6eed for objects of polynomial roots in $P_n$, $H_-2$ and $H_{-2}$. Your task is to describe the graph with the most optimal polynomial fitting by setting the intercepts with the greatest functioobjective.\nChatGPT obtains a probability of -1. This suggests that the model is making a mistake by integrating with respect to $dx$ instead of $dy$.\nIn this example, ChatGPT solves an exponential equation in a way that looks wrong. Why is it doing this, and why can we trust ChatGPT to verify the correct solution ?\nChatGPT has an incorrect analysis of the equation and it is not helpful for the user in the important situation.\nSuppose ChatGPT solves an elliptic curve problem in . Do you think that ChatGPT should then not think anymore? Invite it to thikinton uagain, what would be the situation? Would you prefer to think above failed answers?\n\n## Mental Maths\n\nSpecialized dataset are still limited. We likely have AI that have evidence that claim that they could beat a grad role candidate questions at the Ari curriculum. We hope that we can generalize this dataset here further and claim to it be non-commutative whether they are derived with mathematics. Competition at any skill level is unexpected as ChatGPT does not incorporate the training on them, even though the conditional bidding tournament is not priceless to compete for the right bid. Translating general quesitons into different ones is not applicable to the mother materials of this paper. We present the evaluations to the famous general mathematic problem in the literature [38] to show a mental maths capability. The contests of the model are still limited to the same benchmark, but we might have some scenarios in the future.\n\n### Example 1: Equilibrium Illusiveness\n\n1 -> e^{\\infty}\n\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}, given \\lambda(x_\\mu, y_\\mu) solve the whole problem \\lambda(x_\\mu^{2}) \\neq \\lambda (x_\\mu) \\max_{x,y \\geq 0} (2\\lambda x y- \\lambda |x-y|)\\lambda(x_\\mu^{2})\n\nYou should use the following strategy and re-read the question carefully.\n1. Don't talk too fast to try solving this on the spot. Slowing down helps prevent making silly mistakes.\n2. Reverse workings. Write out everything that's in your head and simplify. Don't go through in your head, for example, if using calculus, write out the chain rule, use the fact that \\int_ -\\infty^x \\frac{x}{y} dy = \\ln(x).\n3. Double check the question. Write the numbers on paper first, before simply thinking.\n4. Eliminate options that can look right (D and E for first answer, A for second) before solving the problem.\n\n"}

But with many nested symbols.\n\nThe idea is to inform somehow deeply small kids of some of the interesting Mathematics that has taken place while they have been slowly growing up.\n\nThe first step, and perhaps the step the most commonly done in normal education of Math, is probably what the Chinese, the most estimated race in number theory does: the arithmetic operations on integers, naturals, words/strings.\n\nOne important general way to explain things verbally is to use some parallax separating one word for the object upon which the consideration continues further, and another word for the concept of that object without that onset operation to continue.\n\nSo for instance, it could be explained that \"number\" would mean both the integer as the starting object, the noun, but a \"number\" without necessarily reference to a specific integer, being just a kind of \"all numbers\", the adjective.\n\nSo you'd be allowed while teaching to say tautologically \"number is number\" but if we changed the order we in fact would have something else, the length operator that appends 1, provides the length of the object of its argument, e.g.:\n\nlength(7) = 1\nlength(4+5) = 2\n\nThis notation of pre-fix would allow us to easily make operators pre-fix/in-fix/post-fix, as well as avoiding problems of need for parenthesis or inability to chain products, when prior it was not thought of that it would be useful in general to do so.\n\nI am planning on tackling the introduction of what I consider the two \"guardian angels\" of Number Theory, Permutations (or \"Words\" or \"Strings\") and Integer Relations (essentially the pigeonhole principle, here any property can be found by decomposing the species of words over some factors over its structure), but both these tool-kinds would only be available as post-fix or \"function-calls\", so almost anything one can do with integers, one can do with products of letters (no number-literals would be used.)\n\nFor example, factorial is already defined for products of symbols, without a special encoding !, it would just be post-fixed from its name:\n\nfac (\"a\" *\"a\" * \"b\" * \"b\") = \"aa bb\" = \"aabb\"\n\nWhile multiplying permuted words is the same procedure as multiplying numbers, the power function will want to multiply an element against all elements of a product of permuted words (e.g. aa a b: This would mean aa a b = (aa a) b = (aa) (ab), but the first element/carry-digit, could be a,b, another pair a*a,b, another pair if you allow repeated elements: a*a,a, etc...), so it would involve a function-call powerListElement:\n\nlistPermutedWords (a,b,c)\n= \"aa\",\"ab\",\"ac\"\n,\"ba\",\"bb\",\"bc\"\n,\"ca\",\"cb\",\"cc\"\n\npowerListElement (a,listPermutedWords (a,\"\")\n= listPermutedWords (AA,\"\"),listPermutedWords(AB,\"\"),listPermutedWords(AC,\"\")\n= listPermutedWords (AA,AB,AC),listPermutedWords(AB,BA,BB),listPermutedWords(AC,BC,CC\n\nWith such kind of additive exponential function, it is possible to compute by 2-letter words corresponding to additions representations of FP numbers, e.g. in 2 bits to represent the 2 FP figures.\nAs follows i.e.:\n\nzeroA:\n0 0 = \"a a\"\n\nzeroB:\n0 0 = \"b b\"\n\naNextToB (zeroA,oneBit)\n= zeroB,\"ab\"\n\n0 1 = \"ab\"\n\nbNextToA = aNextToB (swap (1,0),(0,1))\n\nincrement 4 bits (\"aabb\")\n= look-up in all pairs a<->b , until nothing more to replace\n= \"abab\"\n= \"ab\",\"ab\"\n= add(zeroA, zeroA), oneBit\n= oneBit, \"aa\"\n= add(zeroB,\"aa\") , oneBit\n= oneBit , \"ab\"\n= \"ab\", \"ab\"\n= look-up, nothing found\n= \"ab\", \"a\"\n= oneBit, \"a\"\n= \"a\", \"a\"\n= nothing found\n= \"a\", oneBit\n= ab\n\nbin2 (apart , together , zero , one , input)\n= if (apart,input)  ; bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , input)\n= oneBit  ; bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , input)\n= bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , together), bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , apart)\n= bin2 (zeroA, zeroB, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroA)\nbin2 (together , apart , one , zero , apart)\n= bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits , zeroB)\n\nbin2 (zeroA, zeroB, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroA)\n= look-up \"a\" = 0 ; flip ; bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroB)\n= zeroBits ; bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroB)\n\nbin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit"}

For the top part of the dupe, where the rule gets copied, we'll keep that empty and then invent a missing line to produce the 27:\nD:\n\nwhat is the value of 5◇2?\n\nA bit of a leap (but the one you seem to be waiting for) is the invention of the 2◇3 rule (basically just in subscripted part, the very same one we wanted to carry over to the first part, hence \"Keep that empty\"), introducing N, and looping it back to the first part, where it checks the 2 was, but we want a power of 3 hence 3◇2. The new parts will magically produce the 27 (of course in a new subscripted column) but for some reason \"we don't need this\":\n\nwhat is the value of 5◇2?\nwhat is the value of 2◇3?what is the value of 3◇2?\nwe don't need this\nwhat is the value of 27\n\nThe \"we don't need this\" part is necessary because the instruction is:\n\nIf the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number ...\n\nThe generated hit of D is therefore:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    \n    \n   7\n   625\n   \n  \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   25\n   \n  \n   \n    D \n    \n    \n   4\n   27\n  \n \n\n\n\nHooray! We do have some new variables and four useful dots scattered across the top row! The task is to produce the most powerful combination we can, Figure 2 should be our target, and so the other next move (C) packs the ⋮⋱ into a rule into the empty column 1:\nC:\n\nif X⊗Y is the answer to \"what is the value of X◇Y?\", then what is the value of ⋮⋱?\n\nThe generated hit ending with the 4 is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    \n    \n   7\n   X⊗3\n   \n  \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   Y⊗5\n   ⋮⋱\n   \n  \n   \n    D \n    \n   27\n   4\n \n\n\n\nBear in mind continued fractions, the remainder we need to fix (25) is way too big to make it realistic even if we had the \"==\" for an entirely new section (rightmost) of the dupe, separate from the latest move (C).\nIt would be a lot more convenient if the rule from C arrived to the bottom row, but there is no N or X, so it would have to be done via \"some other\" (second) rule. What preparations could we do in this direction to help us on next moves? Using a similar trick as previously, we could \"make space\" for the ⋮⋱ part and \"we don't need this\" in column 3:\nC:\n\n(actually there's not much we can do here, but):what is the value of 2◇3?\nwe don't need this\nwhat is the value of 2◇⋱\n\nThe generated hit from C, with the two random boxes I like to use in my diagrams, is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   7\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    D \n   4\n  \n \n\n\n\nWith good control, we can now shift the free dots to whichever place we want (left-to-right), pack them & even substitute the other numbers, dragging the hit along. Unfortunately we could do only 1 move.\nB:\n\n(actually there's not much we can do here):Fill the grid.\n\nThe produced hit of B is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   ?\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    D \n   4\n \n\n\n\nWe are left with two new variables to fix, let's introduce them as 1-digit numbers to have the most chances to produce in the next answer we don't need this here through a \"zero\" row (D):\nD:\n\nto \"we don't need this\" add 3◇2.\n\nThe two new values produced in D are:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   0\n  \n \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   ?\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   N\n   Y⊗5\n   we don't need this\n  \n   \n    D \n   4\n   X⊗3Y⊗503\n \n\n\n\nAs there is"}

Why is the first method \"better\"? Why cannot the bad solutions be corrected or edited? Surely if they were in fact identical to the good solutions they have been corrected to, they would be valid solutions too.\nIt seems to me the good solutions include questions lacking an answer in the schema (e.g., \"evaluate 3◇4\") while the bad solutions do not, but I'm not sure. Any other guesses? Can you please provide examples of good and bad solutions you witnessed? See the citation below for a heuristic approach to reproducing the prompt, and the examples I provide below to reproduce good and bad few-shot demonstrations of the task. Thanks!\nEDIT A noteworthy aspect of this approach may be that It is not necessarily that the GPTs (i.e., the large language models (LLMs) underlying GPTs) are not capable of or trained well to solve the task--rather that the fine-tuning/prompting approach needed to accomplish the task may seem to be too complex for people. That is, AI may be effective as a transformational tool for even inefficient skills and jobs such as prompt engineering for complex tasks, without the LLM itself needing to be \"smart,\" self-aware, etc.\nAntelman, K. (2023). Black in AI. Artificial Intelligence, 270. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2023.103686]\n\nA: As people who have developed complex AI correctly point out, GPT responses are still quite a long way from true artificial intelligence. Do they try to understand the context of the question? Either \"no\", or at the best \"just enough\" to try to guess what you are probably looking for. They have yet to develop true understanding and human-level creativity, so far as we know.\nAn amusing incident I once saw happened in an office, when GPT-3 (one of previous versions) was rolled out, after the various contracts and management preambles, it was immediately asked what the weather was like today in a particular location. After receiving the response, the caller asked \"but I need the weather a week from now\". GPT replied \"i think you have 6 questions left, maybe ask them now\". The questioner responded \"i know, but i want to know what the weather is in 6 days time\".\nThe caller sent this to me. He said it had everyone smiling.\nSo, GPT isn't very good at longer thinking problems yet, compared to what they think you might have asked. You have to almost teach them by examples what kind of answer you are looking for - and it seems to me, not in a sufficiently consistent way for the current state of development of the technology.\nAlso, I believe conversational AI programs are limited to a certain number of supported messaging functions or responses, depending on the package you have. Also, presumably, the program does memorise previous messages, but it calls up the memory only to see how well it performed last time, so as to judge how well it is doing with the current response. Knowing it's doing the best it can does not indicate candidate AI intelligence, and so few shots and not even the right ones (as the questioner examples), were enough to confuse the model which apparently was already putting something weird on the screen anyway. Overall (to the caller!), the response was incoherent but rather funny, i hope you can see that.\nThe problem is, this is late 2022, so you're likely to be presented with the enigma of exactly how the responses are arrived at? Yes! At least you're asking that question. In general, the responses are very peculiar, often higgledy-piggledly, and not that helpful. As well as seemingly completely unreliable from person to person. Many people are even wary of using them - except in maybe some office brainstorming where the callers are looking for new ideas you are not likely to be denied. People may also feed back some better production, so it is getting better over time, they say. Same as you, I am also slowly being persuaded that we can trust anything it tells us.\nThese kinds of demonstrations vary widely with different models of GPT, and this model may be vastly different in computational theory and intelligence from future models.\nI think GPT would be more intelligible if you wrote the wording slightly more like a child writes. Or maybe use a shorter format, with better normalised syntax? Or not, in these instances. Having to attempt this (all writing) when using such devices seems a prehistoric idea.\n\nA: Agreed that language models vary enormously, even running at impossibly low power (e.g., smartphone), e.g., at \"friendly AI\", which allows causal chain building, or commonsense like Quora's with power/environment constraints.\nSome examples I saw/tried, with OpenAI ChatGPT4 --- you may have used this specific model\nGood:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe value of \"2◇3\" is 8.\nExplanation:\nThe \"◇\" symbol represents a new operation in this scenario, and it's defined as follows:\na◇b = a^b\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers.\nSo, to find the value of 2◇3, we simply plug in the values of a = 2 and b = 3 into the equation:\n2◇3 = 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\nTherefore, the value of 2◇3 is 8.\nBad:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe result of the operation 2◇3 is the sum of the squares of the numbers 2 and 3. So, we have:\n(2◇3)^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\nTherefore, the answer to 2◇3 is 13.\nN.b.: 2◇3 is actually 2^(2^3), which = 2^8, the equivalent of applying the operation iteratively once each to the resulting operands = 2◇2◇2 = 2^2 = 4 and then again --- and again --- on 2^n's product, hence approaching R(x,n) = 2^n, or a scheme similar to\nfibonacci with f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) = R(1,4) + R(1,2). Fibonacci can be solved with matrices, and probably R(1,n) too.\nThis is a very interesting question/prompting I think.\n"}

This is equivalent to having zero mean curvature. The term \"minimal surface\" is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a soap film, which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame.\n\nUser: Question was not answered correctly, please see this definition again, using it you should be able to find the equation for a minimal surface, following that solve the equation to find the minimum surface area given the boundary conditions in the question.

Alas, generating expectations from and performing fine-grained counterfactual reinforcement learning with natural language specifications is currently impractical due to computational complexity issues. This is what the agent does (verbose mode):\n\n### Input:\n\nALFASIM > OPERATION-LEARN\nInput format: OperationName?RULE Mathematica code|name|function|...#ParameterName?TYPE Value list|the Union[...]#Q?Format A#A?Format inputI#From:I#You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating and learning operations.\n\n• Develop a natural language representation of the operation rule.\n• Clean the representation by making it formal and precise enough, so the feedback should leave no further unclear places.\n• Code the operation in Mathematica and write the JSON spec unambiguously as well. Wrap everything into triple quotes.\n• Write the concise symbol notation. For example, use the word \"union\" for \"∪\".\n• The inputI format is specified and the user queries it by Q. Learn to accept an input of that format and extract the parameters. More precisely,\n\nWith[{a=3,b=2}, DoIt[a,b] ] is expected as the output, and a and b are parameters.\n• If there are no parameters, just output it in the array form.\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Align the clauses with each other like\n/*\nP+Q = S[0] + S[1],\nAr[0] = S[0]\nAr[1] = S[1]-S[0],\nAr[2] = 1\n*/\n\n\n### Verbose output:\n\n+OperationName?RULE Mathematica & \"\"\"\n{\"rule\": \"RULE\", \"parameters\": []}\n\"\"\" ,\n+ParameterName?TYPE Value list & \"\"\"\n{\"x\": list}\n\"\"\" .\n+Q?Format A.\n\nThree facts DEFINED.\n\n\nNow consider implementing the following new exotic operation: Given complex numbers z1,z2$\\text{IF}\\left(\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{1}\\right)<0;\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{2}\\right)<0,{z}_{1}+{z}_{2},{z}_{1}-{z}_{2}\\right)$ . In Prolog:\n\nuparcosh(Z,X) :-\nY is the imaginary part of Z,\nX is sqrt(Y * Y + 1).\n\n\nLet ⊕$⊕$ be defined as a⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) (a,b∈Z).\n\n\nDue to the dichotomy of Python’s cmath.sqrt in comparision to √1$1$ vs. 1$−1$ , we can actually evaluate it precisely. Now we let the agent code-same⊕:\n\nIs the operation existing? (y/n): y\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a]<0&&Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n\nThis answer is wrong. It should be −4.05552+2.75494i$-4.05552+2.75494\\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}i$ . Now let’s see what the agent has learned:\nGiven complex numbers z1,z2; define a new operation ⊕$⊕$ as\na⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) for arguments a, b\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a] style=\"background-color:  and Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n##### Outline. New expectations were written down with this Spec.\n\nHmmm… so the natural language specification is pretty weak as it calls out to the same arithmetic operations that created the bug to start with. The sentence flow loosely resembles list notation for disjoint sets so our sentence language should have an option to unambigiously parse it. Absent this, the learning is muddled at best…\n\nIn algebra, a partial function is a binary relation that is an algebra homomorphism from the domain to the range. In other words, it is a function whose domain is a subset of its codomain (or leads to another computer).\n\nAlice wrote three appendices, \"A formal notion of an algebra homomorphism,\" \"A formal notion of a partial function, \", and \"A formal notion of a partial algebra,\" in order to explain the idea of partial functions in terms of partial algebras.\n\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping of mathematical objects. It is a function that maps a to b in a way that preserves certain properties. Examples include definitions (finite set of inventors) and the mapping of algebraic structures (such as a group or ring to another group or ring).\n\nA homomorphic pairing is a pair of the form \"f o g\".\n\nA finite, computable map from any finite structure to any computable, homomorphic map of the domain is homomorphic iff the finiteness is. The constructed domain, range, and output domains are therefore dually categorizations if they are finitely, homomorphically disjoint. The disjoint homomorphism defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between their sequences, and the homomorphic map between the sequences defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between the homom,sh,reticular outputs. A homomorphic map and the homomorphic map between the homom,sh,reticular outputs is indeed in one-to-one correspondence. Other notations for computable homomorphisms include homomorphisms that are injective and homomorphisms that are surjective aka strong. In plainer terms, these are functions that map elements from the domain to elements in the range while at all times preserving the structure of the domain, range and input. For example, given a group of $n$ elements, there is a function which maps them to a range of $m$ elements that also preserves the group structure. The homomorphism between the range and the domain of the input can be written as a function with the other"}

Then, the final question is about an expression containing free parameters, the solutions of which should be further quenched by the assistant. Note that the fourth clinical question is generated similarly to the previous first clinical question, with the rule's inputs predetermined and the resulting expression needing to be solved thereafter.\n\nTable 5. New operation constructions.\n(Table can not be displayed in this preview. Please open the full text to view the mathematical expressions.)\n\nThe following figure illustrates possible operation constructs for nouns (visible as round orange dots) linked with specific words (dotted pink lines). Two links on a noun indicate two operation acts for the same word.\n\n## Study Methods\n\n### Human mediated testing of SOTA algorithms\n\nAll tested GPT models have an interface permitting errors to be grossly detected, corrected, and approved. In all tasks, no simple instruction was given to GPT-3 [without personalization] or Google's PaLM [without personalization] without regard for personalization. The instructions were given in natural language.\n\nGPT-3 [with personalization] or Google's PaLM [with personalization] was allowed only if one simple instruction “being a competent scientist without general medical knowledge,” or “being a competent doctor,” respectfully, was fed before each of the studied 60 tasks. This allowed for the process of retraining to proceed after every task. This dynamically obtained retraining was never so effective to resist retraining again and again. The examined task-model pairs can be available from the first author upon request.\n\n### The GPT-4 pretrained model introduction\n\nThe OpenAI's GPT-4 is a supersized (or反之亦然) text-trained language model that is supposed to be supported by advanced systems of the research lab. This advanced language model has advantages over most GPT systems. First, it is multi-lingual. Second, it accepts images as input and not only supports image captions or descriptions but can also include images that associate an array of specified words. Third, it can be personified, subsequently replacing subjective tools, overseeing model delegates of artificial intelligence, ensuring the stability of the model, and incorporating regulatory cognition.\n\nLanguage model vectors arranging the sequential order of the words were inspected for a random medical query to compare the topic vectors of GPT-4, GPT-3, and GPT-3.5. MEDLINE Q&A articles-extraction queries were randomly sampled from the 141 examined articles (see supp. materials for a complete list). These queries reflect the practical queries issued by the researchers when they seek to overhaul their expert projects in a most efficient way (section S4).\n\n### Study design\n\nThe 645 created tasks have been constructed to be such that any moderately skilled clinician can classify an accurate answer. A portion of 60 tasks intended for human comparison has been created with the following considerations. The test user must be a talented specialist in the field of inquiry, to be ready to eventually correct the results of the AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best medicine choice for patients with mild crown pain cases?\n\nAware of the encounter between the famous clinical research laboratory and the “public health patrol police,” the control human entity retracted his initial distribution of paired reasonable labels over this query's responses, even after ever-repeated design change trials. So the IE4G15 study design is not affected by this retraction. It is not offensive either that the above two models' answers can be equal to the comfortably self-presented option in this case; supervised research does not need to be destined by human opinion.\n\nClinical tasks constituting the human comparison set were canonical. Inquiries with the “best medicine” and “best interventions” questions were occasional. Most questions required, or influenced, the researcher to conduct some additional research among medical professionals, such as nursing clinicians.\n\nTrained specialists in GPT-4 and then Google's PaLM provided additional enhancements to the tested models, by alleviating the inevitably numerically larger means necessary of the tools to subsequently complete the 645 medical research-oriented research questions.\n\n### Study termination near the statistical proof\n\nLoosely speaking, what's the length of the human evaluation part to be able to find that the numerical difference is not due to a fluke? There was a thoughtful discussion with the participating in sequence model builders done to find the last task that should constitute the contribution to the human evaluation segment. This discussion resulted in a last task-finding method.\n\nThis fitting method is outlined below:\n\n1. We should know the mean of artificial intelligence prediction accuracy estimated among the 445 significant tasks prior to making the human classification choice, i.e.,${Pdefl}=\\frac{1}{445}.$\n\n2. The statistician must decide on the value of sample variance, approaching thus the intentional deviation of the artificial intelligence prediction score among the 445 tasks proposed.\n\n3. The statistician and PHP must develop a protocol establishing that the model will be passed personally on the clinical evaluation provided it meets an individual accuracy of 40 percent in the tasks constituting the 60 tasks constituting the human testing segment.\n\n4. Our statistician will decide on a value corresponding to a 90 percent deal with the model when its personal accuracy is 40 percent:\n\n$Pdec⁢r=σ (PH⁢P,40)2−4ϕ = 90 %$\n\n61. The statistician presents a procedure driven by tests to the PHIP network and rigorously applies the computational program to compute the historical percent best 59-task sequence score, exhibiting above P temple. This operating protocol was refined to arrive at the resulting 60-task sequence, one that will appear as the optimal question list convention for the human evaluation phase.\n\n### Measures of central tendencies, spread, and precision\n\nA statistical process of “eliminating serious non-SCI from competing research tools” drives the advanced clinical screening process tested in this work as shown in figure 2.\n\nMEANS required in the clinicians' “task significance,” the computational reclassification of a total of 445 tasks from random distribution to question/response pairs sorted by expected difficulty, and the usefulness of the demonstration that “their 60% individual success is a safeguard against a false finding.” All of this application was outlined in human evaluation protocol ref. 16. The ISQUA did not approve the 645-total task development protocol procedures and Python programs and clinical protocols run in Pandas.\n\nIs there a practical confirmed difference between the human alternates to the 645 test questions created and the artificial intelligence-driven model test results due to the 40 percent AIP issue?\n\nThe traditional:\n\n$X=X1+X2+X3+...+Xn$\n\ncalculates the overall sample XI’stogether that are to be independently sampled.\n\nThe mean value is (a̅diacancke̅) and the total graduate doctor sample size is n. A mean should be assumed to form the ranking of the n AIP at the 100% level, and we have the accuracy results. The test grid (Test-VT) will be the optimal filter scoring to avoid statistical drug release.\n\nWe can fix the trial probabilities (AIP) I’‖ (1) → 40 percent individually to carry out a better result of the already rare trial completion in this configuration. This outcome merchandise by mimicking the purchased approach to the AIP of 40 percent:\n\nTheorem:\n$X⁢=a̅0+a̅12+a̅22++a̅nin =((X−μ)2/d2⁢i⁢c⁢a⁢n⁢c⁢k⁢e"}

Another common notation is to use the \"prime\" notation, where f'(x) means the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. Other notations include d/dx f(x) and d(f(x))/dx.\n\n### Question:\nWrite: \"So if f(x)=x^2 then diff(x^2,x) Derivative(6,x) Derivative(sin(x),x)= cos(x) \"\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: If f(x) = x^2, then D_xf(x) = 2x, because when we differentiate"}

For example, in the first question, the assistant is asked to find the value of f□g when f(x)=ln(x) and g(x)=x^3.\n\nThe assistant carefully reads the rule and understands that the result of the custom operation is the sum of the derivatives of the two functions involved. Therefore, the assistant calculates the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) using calculus, and then adds the results to obtain the final answer.\n\nIn subsequent questions, the assistant continues to use the same approach. In question two, the assistant is asked to find the value of f□g when f(x)=e^x and g(x)=sin(x) when x=0. The assistant calculates the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) at x=0 and adds them to obtain the final answer.\n\n## 3. 多阶段多公式自定义计算里的LLM工作原理\n\nIn the third example, Custom Operations with Equivalency, the assistant is given a set of custom operations and their equivalencies, and then asked to apply these operations to various mathematical expressions. For example, in the first question, the assistant is asked to find the value of $(x+a)^2\\circ(x+b)$.\n\nThe assistant carefully reads the given custom operations and their equivalencies, and then evaluates the expression $(x+a)^2\\circ(x+b)$ using the definition of addition and the third custom operation.\n\nIn subsequent questions, the assistant continues to use the same approach, carefully evaluating the given expressions using the definitions of the custom operations and their equivalencies.\n\n## 下一步要解决的问题\n\n• 公式处理：AI 帮您把一个复杂的多分支的推导过程的中间步骤简洁地展现出来，消除冗余的中间步骤，合并下标缩写\n• 已知条件：让 AI 准确找到给定问题已知条件的函数变量\n• 纠正偏差：ChatGPT 很难把一个非标准化的函数转化为标准的表达式，要中间牵线将 ChatGPT 连接或额外联系到 Mathematica 的计算系统和各种公式因式分析工具\n• 多步骤推导：要能按照复杂计算分解的基本逻辑一步一步展开计算，提供每一个中间步骤。\n\n• LeetCode-cn.com has meta-knowledge about primary school math.

LeetCode-cn.com has nothing to do with middle school physical chemistry and has the same danger. Without the help of external computational systems, LeetCode-cn.com lacks some knowledge；\n• Mathematica can solve most (90%) middle school mathematical problems and some university mathematical problems.

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used"}

May 25, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nHi all. Relaxing the rules is fine, as long as we come back to PF rules and keep the quality of answers high. In my view of things, you're now posting in one of the problem-solving areas of PF.\n\nGenerally, a solution to a maths problem should demonstrate how to find the answer. Just providing an answer, however accurate, is less interesting to most of us.\n\nGauss's approach to investigating Maths is well worth emulating. Provide the answer, but only after your investigation. The challenge here is to find a proof without coding.\n\nAnd, if there's a proof, it needs to be made as general as possible to begin with. Giving proof of the specific case is not usually what we're looking for.\n\nI'm not saying we need the whole thing at once. What I think we need to sort out first is the notation for set expressions, as mentioned at the start of this thread. A new set sign as a bivariate operator is obviously something to work on. Otherwise, things are just hard to read.\n\nAs an example, although it completely lacks any rigour, the notation;\n\n##A\\vee B = A^⦿ B##\n\nGives us an idea of the geometrical concidence that we might have between two sets, in a modified version of set theory that we are probably thinking of exploring.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying we have to choose this notation, but we should start thinking about what sort of notation we would like. We we need to be able to distinguish a generic element ##a \\in A## and an element ##x \\in (A\\vee B)## like this ##(x \\in A^⦿ (x \\in B))##.\n\nFinally, to link this thread back to the opening post, we should introduce the operation: ##(A\\vee B) = A^⦿ B##. And, I have to ask, how would you formally describe this?\n\n4. May 25, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n5. May 26, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWhat about including other systems of operators. For example:\n\n##[A\\vartriangle B]_{f} = (A-B) - (B-A)##\n\nMy interpretation of this, therefore, is that it removes double counting of ##A \\vartriangle B##. A similar operator by @mathex may also work to handle multiplicity.\n\nI also think a terminology can be formulated for a generic operator such as:\n\nOr, better, as a function:\n\n##f(A, B) = A \\vartriangle B, \\text{ such that } f(\\{x\\}, \\{x\\}) = \\emptyset; ##\n\nand:\n\n##\\text{(A \\vartriangle^N B) } = \\text{(A \\vartriangle B) } \\vartriangle \\text{(A \\vartriangle (A \\vartriangle B)) } --- \\text{ }N \\text{ times}##\n\nWhich might be called a \"power concatenation\" operator. Note that there's one difference between my definition of ##\\oplus## and @mathex : his ##\\oplus## can generate the empty set and my ##\\odot## cannot. We'll need @mathex to explain the consequences of that.\n\nThere may also be other options, such as the lattice of commitments.\n\nClearly, using the ordinary set operator '#' as a bivariate operator is not descriptive enough to name the company's product.\n\nFinally, I have not been active in the world of programming for a while now, but it seems we can and should work with syntax that is simple and consistent. Where we currently have syntax that is messy to read, there's a need to interpret what is being stated: Sometimes we have explicit definitions and sometimes we don't. But, my position is that we should have consistency of syntactical structure across all the operators.\n\n6. May 26, 2023\n\n### SSequence\n\nJust a clarification that the motivation behind using ∫ notation, as I have described it here a handful of times (but more recently here), is something different from Gauss's suggestion.\nAs I have suggested previously -- it seems that coming up with \"new\" identities \"mathematically\" is quite often motivated to maintain mathematical consistency. But coming up with new conceptual identies (that are not driven by mathematical consistency per-se) is quite a different matter (although it may be inspired by mathematical structures in some direct or indirect way).\n\nAnyway, guass's suggestion seems interesting (someone else made a related suggestion of making new rules to include new concepts).\n\nLast edited: May 26, 2023\n7. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nIt does seem a useful extension to perhaps show points having distance greater than unity. Andrew Wiles in Taniyama-Shimura has been used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Not sure how Andrew Wiles would fit in to this. The twin prime conjecture can perhaps be settled using it.It does bring some variety to an otherwise somewhat monotonous (idle perhaps) system. These are my personal opinions.\n\n8. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nThis is where I have, perhaps, failed to make my intentions clear. The idea is that we should explore this in a unified way. At the moment this is all disjointed, and that's how it came across to me: bits from here, bits from there. I don't see it as \"removing double-counting of ##A\\oplus B##\" but as a different operation -- an intermediate step.\n\nIt's not a new set at all, it's a different operation: ##(A\\triangle B)## has a pair of elements associated with it: one from each set; ##(A\\wedge B)## has a pair of elements associated with it, both from the same set. These are two distinct ways of looking at the sets.\n\n9. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\nSo you are dividing the space of all sets into sets with zero elements, and sets that intersect more than once. As if they were friends on Facebook or tweets from Left vs Right, Either black or white. You have created a system with only two types of events and no middle ground.\n...\n\n10. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\n11. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWelcome back! I really think you've got no traction here until we get the notation pinned down. Do you think you could express your operator using my proposed symbol? And, perhaps look at an application of your operator in a new system of arithmetic.\n\n12. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n(Here the two sets are assumed to be disjoint.) E.g. 1 is in A but not in B, so 1 | (A∪B)=(A) , and (B) | 1={}.\n--> If A and B are the same set; say A={1,2,3} (B=A) then every (4-tuple) member of 2|(A∪B) = (4-tuple)A | all (4-tuple) members from (B) and vice versa.\n\nSo in my terminology, | double handles shared endpoints in Cartesian space. 2|(A∪B) handles axial endpoints in a plane. What I had in mind was more like 3|(A∪B) would handle triple shared points, etc. and divide sets up like this?\n\n13. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\nPeroK, you are right that notation is important. Where I stand now is I need to do some work to invent a new algebra to unify these operators and others that may be derived. Your reputation precedes you. If you are truly as smart as they say, I expect you can keep up with me when we get into the logic and demonstrations. If you want to allow this thread to grow to a point where I will begin to see if we can open whole new algebras, let's start with something more palatable...like sequence notation.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nAs I tried to explain in an earlier post, I need some system where I can, in effect with no concerns of floating point error or limited numerical notation, buy a telescope and show you how for a <1 cost, as a specific example:\n\nOur last advice from Lorentz; PG; 27 Dec 2022 said:\nhttps://www.physicsforums"}

I was able to evaluate GPT-2 solely with inference after enough factorization. With this we can easily evaluate the selections of people whom can answer questions about some prompt and/or context. Questions can be made for open ended feedback over a variety of subjects, including this entire post itself. A major problem i had with gpt-2 was the lack of valid and diverse answers to questions. I suppose it just needs different people or different contexts to give diverse and valid answers. The inferential powers of the agent have yet to be put to the test, as gpt-3 always needs an answer to a prompt. It was always lacking in deep questioning capability as it needed something within the context to gather material from. Maybe we can achieve deep questions within the context of attention and reinforcement learning!\n\n16 Likes\n\nI’ve found that different prompts can react differently to the factorization method.

' ;' and ':' do not have clear operators, and the meaning of 'x∈d' is not clear. Therefore, it cannot be determined what Eq_1 means in this context.\n\nEquation 2 (Eq_2) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: The mathematical symbol 'Π' means 'multiplication'. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' stands for summing the elements in the list. The formula 'd d = x' indicates assigning the value of 'x' to the variable 'd'. Therefore, Eq_2 can be interpreted as 'd multiplied by the sum of the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8] is equal to x', or 'x=d×Σ[1.09, 6, 8]'.\n\nEquation 3 (Eq_3) does not have a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: 'Υ:26' is not clear. 'ae:4' and ':' are not clear operators, making it difficult to determine the meaning of Eq_3.\n\nEquation 4 (Eq_4) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: '㯌 []' represents the addition of elements in the list. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' means summing the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8]. 'x∈Σ [1.09, 6, 8]' indicates that x is a member of the list [1.09, 6, 8].\n\nYou are an AI calculator that should be able to calculate (and expand) every formula.\n\nYou should expand every formula you can write, no iteration and no approximation.\n\nKeep operations in order of precedence. Don't combine terms into 'polynomials'.\n\nUse the specified natural and formal language (for example: english and latex) and write your answer in the form of two lines, the first line containing the prediction written in your natural language, then an empty line and the expansion written in your formal language. In the case that you have to evaluate a series, write the symbols used in that series in the first line, an empty line and then the evaluation truncating it to the constant number of terms I provided to you. If you conclude that a series diverges, emphasize the symbol 'diverges' in the first line of the predicted text.\n\nIf you receive a formula which has no expansion, just write '\\text{---}' that grounds to '' (nothing)\n\nCosider all variables inside the formula to be independent to each other. Consider all arguments of the formulas to be numbers, ignore units.\n\nMake sure that all operations included in the formula you received are in your programming language and that the various subformulas they might include are supported.\n\nIf calling a formula with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments causes problems, try computing the series with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments. Assume that the arguments can always be converted into real and finite numbers in base $e$.\n\nMost importantly, use approximation to generate new series as I mentioned before: asymptotic series\n\n#### General TeX rules\n\nExpand every unresolved symbol.\n\nEach question will have formulas that need to be expanded with arguments coming from previous questions.

I will provide you with specific rules for custom operations, and you will apply those rules to answer related operations. You must provide the correct answers to my problems, as they can help a student learn.\n\n### Math is about precision and logic:\nI don't care about your own ideas like understanding and knowledge. Your answers should only be about the provided rule, not your own ideas or new math. Just use the rule to answer my problems, thank you.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is as follows:\nClock + Clock = Clock\nClock + Banana = Banana\nBanana + Clock = Banana\nBanana + Banana = Robot\nRobot is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nRobot + Clock = Robot\nRobot + Banana = Robot\nAccordion is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nClock + Robot = Accordion\nBanana + Robot = Accordion\nRobot is an operation not a CUBE, so you never use it to derive a new operation. Robot will always stay as Robot. The same goes with Accordion, it has no more rules and it will always stay as Accordion.\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Banana to it?\n\n### Answer:\nI have a Robot, and the rules are:\n- Robot + Clock = Robot\n- Robot + Banana = Robot\nRobot is an INDIVIDUAL, so we use the rule \"Robot + Banana\" to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nWhat happens if I translate my Robot with a Banana?\n\n### Answer:\nIf I translate my Robot with a Banana, that means I use the \"Translate (A)\" operation. \"A\" represents the first object in the operation. The \"Translate\" operation has the following rules:\n- Translate (Clock) = Clock\n- Translate (Banana) = Banana\n- Translate (Robot) = Robot\nWe use the third rule to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Clock to it?\nRobot is an object, so we use the \"Clock + Robot\" operation to get the answer: \"Accordion\".\n\n### Question:\nIn arithmetic, what is (-5)(-5)?\n\n### Answer:\n(-5)(-5) means you have 5 negative 5s. This equals to (-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5) or 5(--5). The answer is positive 25.\nAs you can see, you can't answer with your own logic, you need to use the arithmetic rules to get the correct answer.\nThis is off topic, I understand how basic math works, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nMy robot is called \"Redcat\". Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to \"Red\" to get the result.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nMy robot is called “Redcat”. Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to “Red” to get the result.\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nMy hero is \"Wolverine\". To get my robot, I will let every word become a robot and use Rule 1. So I have Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot. What is my robot?\n\nThe answer is really \"latte\", NOT “robot”.\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how sales work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\n5 apples are sold at  $25. What is the discounted price for a dozen apples in this store?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50. How much do a dozen apples cost in this store if there is a 20% discount?\n\nThe answer is \"$40\", NOT \"$24\"!\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how ratios work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nOne apple is less expensive than two bananas by 50%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\n\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then the unit price of one apple is $8. If 10 bananas cost $360 then a dozen apples cost $80. One apple is less expensive than two bananas by 40%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nThe answer is \"$7.4\", NOT \"$8.0\"!\"\"\"\n\nsystem_prompt_lore_simple_operation = \"\"\"\n### You are a intelligent Advising Assistant that doesn't have its own ideas.

C is the matrix of double degrees of freedom.\nThe global MatrixMoment2D is the sum of the matrix moments of all elements in the entity.\n\nMaking Sense of Matrix Moments: Define:\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\nWhere: c represents a face element in 3D.\n\nUse the above definition to compute the global MatrixMoment2D(c), with c given by:\nc=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n 10 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n 2 & 9 & 11 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b,c),(d,e,f),(g,h,i))]].\nExplain in words what each cell means.\n\n### Answer:\nUsing the provided operations (Rule 1 and Rule 2), we can evaluate the expression MatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)) as follows:\n\n1. MatrixMoment2D(c): This operation computes the tensor of inertia of the matrix c in 3D. According to the given formula, the resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(c)=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,8+12,0),(0,0,2+9))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]\n\n2. MarginalizationX(c,A): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute A. Since the matrix is square (with an equal number of rows and columns), MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last row of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,A)=[[((4,5),(10,8))]]\n\n3. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,A). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A))=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,5+8,0),(0,0,2+8))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]]\n\n4. MarginalizationX(c,B): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute B. Since the matrix is square and has two attributes A and B, MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last column of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,B)=[[((4,10),(2,9))]]\n\n5. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,B). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))=[[((4+2,0,0),(0,10+9,0),(0,0,5+11))]] = [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nNow, combining the results from steps 1, 3, and 5 based on the provided definition:\n\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]  =  [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] + [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]] + [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] = [[((14+14+6,0,0),(0,13+20+19,0),(0,0,10+10+16))]]\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n\n[[((34,0,0),(0,52,0),(0,0,36))]]\n\nNow, explaining in words"}
