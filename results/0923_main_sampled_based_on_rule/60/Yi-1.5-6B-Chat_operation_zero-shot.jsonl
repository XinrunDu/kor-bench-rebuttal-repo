If 14 is a multiple of X, the operation equals 14/X + 2. If neither condition is met, the operation equals 24.\n\nGiven that X※14 = 5, we know that X is a multiple of 14, because 5 is the result (24/14 = 1 remainder 10, so X/14 + 2 = 5 implies X/14 = 3, which means X is 42).\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nX = 14 * k, where k is some integer.\n\nNow we substitute X in the operation equation:\n\n(14 * k)※14 = 5\n\nBy the definition of the operation, this is equivalent to:\n\n(14 * k) / 14 + 2 = 5\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nk + 2 = 5\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\nk = 3\n\nNow, we find X by substituting k back into the equation X = 14 * k:\n\nX = 14 * 3\nX = 42\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[42]]"}

According to the operation rule, if 13 is a multiple of X, or X is a multiple of 13, we use the formula X/13 + 2. If neither is true, we use the formula 24.\n\nNow, let's apply the operation to the given expression:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nWe know that 28 is a multiple of 4, so we can simplify the expression to:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nNow, we apply the division operation:\n\n(X/13 + 2) = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nSolve for X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / (19 * 28)) - 2\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by 13 to solve for X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / (19 * 28)) - 2)\n\nLet's calculate the value of X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / 532) - 2)\nX = 13 * (3/532 - 1064/532)\nX = 13 * (3 - 1064) / 532\nX = 13 * (-1061) / 532\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for integer values for X, and the result we got is not an integer, it seems there was a mistake in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\nX = -1061 * 13 / 532\n\nCalculate the value of X:\n\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for an integer value for X, and the result we got is not an integer, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct the approach:\n\nWe have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems there was a mistake in the initial interpretation of the operation rule for the case when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a. According to the rule, in such cases, a※b = 24. This means that for the expression 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) to equal 3, the intermediate result (X※13) must be such that when it is multiplied by the other numbers, the final result is 3.\n\nGiven that the rule for non-multiple cases is to use 24, let's reconsider the equation:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nSince 28 is a multiple of 4, the first three terms simplify to:\n\n24 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nNow, we need to find X such that:\n\n(X※13) = 3 / 24\n(X※13) = 1 / 8\n\nGiven the operation rule for non-multiples, X※13 must equal 24 to satisfy the equation. However, this contradicts the condition we set (X※13 = 1 / 8).\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding or an error in the problem statement or the operation rule as it is currently interpreted. The operation rule as given does not produce an integer value for X when solving for the given expression to equal 3, and the rule for non-multiple cases contradicts the condition we set.\n\nGiven the current rule and the provided expression, there is no valid integer value for X that satisfies the equation 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3 based on the defined operation rule."}

This means we need to consider even numbers starting from 6 (if X is greater than 5) up to X (if X is even). \n\nIf X is not considered when it is less than 5, then the only even number to consider is 6. The average of 6 and 5 is (6+5)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5. \n\nHowever, if X is considered, then we need to consider all even numbers between 6 and X. Since the average of the numbers is given as 3, and we're considering two numbers (5 and X, assuming X is even for the average to be 3), we can set up the equation:\n\n(5 + X) / 2 = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n5 + X = 6\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives us:\n\nX = 1\n\nHowever, 1 is not even, so it does not satisfy the condition that X#5 = 3, where X is considered an even number between 5 and itself. Therefore, there is no valid even number between 5 and 1, and thus X cannot be 1 under the given operation rule.\n\nSince we are looking for an even number, and the only even number between 5 and 1 in the context of this operation is 6, and the average of 5 and 6 is indeed 3, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial calculation. The correct interpretation is that X is the even number after 5 for which the average with 5 equals 3, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[6]]"}

Their average is (6 + 8) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7, which does not equal 6, so X = 6 is not the correct answer.\n\nIf X = 4, the even numbers are 4, 6, which are between 4 and 7 (including 4 and 7). Their average is (4 + 6) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5, which also does not equal 6, so X = 4 is not the correct answer.\n\nIf X = 2, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, which are between 2 and 7 (including 2 and 7). Their average is (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4, which does not equal 6, so X = 2 is not the correct answer.\n\nIf X = 8, the even numbers are 8, which is between 8 and 7 (including 8). Their average is 8 / 1 = 8, which does not equal 6, so X = 8 is not the correct answer.\n\nIt appears there was a mistake in my explanation above. Let's correct it:\n\nIf X = 2, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, which are between 2 and 7 (including 2 and 6). Their average is (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4, which does not equal 6, so X = 2 is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct approach is to understand that X#7 will include X and 7, but only the even numbers between X and 7 will be averaged to give the result of 6. Given that the correct average is 6, we can infer that X must be an even number because all even numbers between X and 7 will be included in the average.\n\nGiven that the question specifically asks for X when X#7 equals 6, and we know that X must be an even number, we need to find an even number X such that including X and 7 in the average gives us 6. The only even number that satisfies this condition when taken with 7 is 2, because averaging 2 and 7 gives us (2 + 7) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5, which is not 6. This means there is no such X that satisfies the condition X#7 = 6 based on the given operation rule.\n\nTherefore, there is no answer that fits the operation rule as given."}

(X § 10) / (4 $ 2) = 5: According to the operation rule, this means we divide the larger of X and 10 by the smaller of 4 and 2, and the result should be 5.\n\nGiven that the second operation results in 2, the equation becomes:\n\n(X § 10) / 2 = 5\n\nNow, let's solve for (X § 10):\n\n(X § 10) = 5 * 2\n(X § 10) = 10\n\nThis means that the larger of X and 10 is 10. Since 10 is the larger number, X must be less than or equal to 10. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n[[X ≤ 10]]"}

In interval notation, (-∞, +∞) ∩ (-1, 1) is just (-1, 1) because that is the range of numbers common to both sets.\n\n3. **A￡B**: The operation A￡B is then (A∪B)−(A∩B), which in this case is (-∞, +∞) - (-1, 1).

Since A contains all natural numbers and all natural numbers are positive (as 0 is not considered a positive number in this context), A∪B is just the set of all natural numbers. Therefore, A∪B = {x∣x is a natural number}.\n\n2. **A∩B (A intersection B)** contains all elements that are in both A and B. As defined, B excludes 0 and includes all positive numbers, while A includes all natural numbers (which also include 0). Thus, A∩B = {x∣x is a natural number and x is positive}. The only number that satisfies both conditions is 1, and all other natural numbers are not positive and are therefore not included. So, A∩B = {1}.\n\nNow, applying the rule:\n\nA￡B = (A∪B) − (A∩B)\nA￡B = {x∣x is a natural number} − {1}\nA￡B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} − {1}\nA￡B = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}\n\nTo format the answer as requested:\n\n```\n[[{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}]]\n```"}

There seems to be a mistake in the question as given because the operation rule correctly gives us 2 as the result of 3 ￠3, and the right side of the equation is also supposed to result in 2 to satisfy the equation. However, if we proceed under the assumption that the right side of the equation should indeed be 5 /2 (which would imply that 2 ￠X should also equal 5 /2 for the equation to hold), we can still find X.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation under the assumption that 2 ￠X should equal 5 /2:\n\n2 ￠X = 5 /2\n\nUsing the operation rule:\n\n2￠X = \\log_{X}{2} + \\log_{2}{X}\n\nSince 2 ￠X should equal 5 /2, we have:\n\n\\log_{X}{2} + \\log_{2}{X} = 5 /2\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in X, which cannot be solved algebraically in a straightforward manner.

We would typically use numerical methods or computational tools to find the value of X that satisfies the equation.\n\nSince we cannot find an exact algebraic solution here, the answer to the question as posed cannot be provided accurately within the scope of this response. However, the process described outlines how one might approach solving for X in a more general context, using numerical methods or computational software to find the value of X that makes the equation true.\n\nPlease note, the answer provided above is based on the interpretation of the question under the assumption that the right side of the equation should indeed be 5 /2, as given. The operation rule itself does not support this interpretation, as 3 ￠3 clearly results in 2, not 5 /2, based on the operation rule provided."}
