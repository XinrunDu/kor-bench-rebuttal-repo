If X is a multiple of 14, then X※14 = X/14 + 2.\n2. If 14 is a multiple of X, then X※14 = 14/X + 2.\n3. If X is not a multiple of 14 and 14 is not a multiple of X, then X※14 = 24.\n\nGiven that X※14 = 5, we can rule out the third scenario immediately, since 5 is not equal to 24. Therefore, we are left with the first two scenarios to consider.\n\nLet's consider the first scenario where X is a multiple of 14. This means X could be 14, 28, 42, etc. The equation based on the operation rule would be:\n\nX/14 + 2 = 5\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX/14 = 5 - 2\nX/14 = 3\nX = 3 * 14\nX = 42\n\nHowever, this scenario does not directly give us X as a single-digit number, and given the simplicity of the problem, it is more likely that we are looking for a solution that fits the second scenario, where 14 is a multiple of X.\n\nLet's consider the second scenario where 14 is a multiple of X. This means X could be any factor of 14, which are 1 and 14. The equation based on the operation rule would be:\n\n14/X + 2 = 5\n\nSolving for X:\n\n14/X = 5 - 2\n14/X = 3\n14 = 3X\nX = 14/3\n\nHowever, X must be an integer, and 14/3 is not an integer. Therefore, the only integer value for X that satisfies the condition of 14 being a multiple of X and the operation rule is X = 1, because 14 is clearly a multiple of 1, and the operation rule can be applied as follows:\n\nX※14 = 14/1 + 2\nX※14 = 14 + 2\nX※14 = 16\n\nThis does not match the given condition that X※14 = 5. Therefore, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the approach to directly applying the second scenario to the question as stated.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation of the problem and the operation rule, we should directly approach the equation as given, recognizing that the direct application of the second scenario to find an integer X that satisfies X※14 = 5 is incorrect based on the problem's structure and the rule provided.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the operation definition does not naturally lead to X being any multiple of 14 except by mistake in interpreting the application of the rule. The rule directly applied to the question's condition does not yield a simple solution that fits the intuitive leap to consider 14 as a multiple of an integer X.\n\nGiven the rule and the condition X※14 = 5, the correct interpretation and direct application of the first scenario, where X is a multiple of 14, leads to a solution that fits the problem's format and the provided operation rule more accurately:\n\nX = 42\n\nThis solution fits the first scenario of the operation rule and satisfies X※14 = 5:\n\n42※14 = 42/14 + 2\n42※14 = 3 + 2\n42※14 = 5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, following the operation rule and the given condition, is:\n\n[[42]]."}

However, 25 is not a multiple of 14, so we move to the next condition.\n\n2. **Second Check**: The operation rule also states that if b (in this case, 14) is a multiple of a (in this case, 25), then 14 ※X = 14/X + 2. Similarly, 14 is not a multiple of 25, so we do not meet any of the division criteria.\n\n3. **Default Case**: Since neither 25 nor 14 divides the other perfectly, according to the rule, the operation 25 ※X ※14 should equal 24, not 4, unless the operation's application here involves a specific sequence or interpretation not clearly outlined in the standard left-to-right or left-to-right evaluation rules. However, following the straightforward application of the given operation rule:\n\n   - If we parse it as (25 ※X) ※14, and we assume that 25 ※X must equal 4 to satisfy the entire expression, we would then look for X such that:\n     - If 25 is a multiple of X (contrary to initial conditions, this step is speculative due to the direct contrast with the operation's criteria but follows the formatting given in the question), then 25 ※X = 25/X + 2 = 4. Solving for X in this speculative scenario would not yield an integer solution, as it would require X to be a factor of 25 that, when paired with 25 to give 20 when added by 2, does not naturally occur with integer X.\n\n   - If we consider the operation in a strictly sequential and possibly misunderstood application given the question's framing, which suggests a direct equivalence to 4 without accounting for the operation's inherent value of 24 under normal circumstances, we're essentially looking for a deviation from the operation's standard rules.\n\nGiven the strict application of the operation rule and the question's format, there's a conceptual mismatch in directly equating 25 ※X ※14 to 4 based on the provided operation. The operation rule, when followed accurately for the given integers and the sequence of operations as presented, does not yield a solution that directly accounts for the entire expression equalling 4 under the standard interpretation.\n\nHowever, the question's structure and the hint at a sequence (25 ※X※14) suggest an exploration beyond the straightforward application of the operation rule. In a strictly academic or puzzle context, one might infer:\n\n- If we treat \"※X※\" as a unit that, when applied to 14, equates the entire sequence to 4, we're in a speculative realm where the operation's standard sequencing or interpretation is not directly applicable.\n\nTherefore, based on a strict adherence to the operation rule and the question's framing:\n\n**Answer**: There is a conceptual issue in directly applying the operation rule to equate 25 ※X※14 to 4 under normal circumstances, suggesting a misunderstanding or a puzzle element not directly solvable by following the given operation's standard calculation for each step. The question's structure and the expectation of 4 as the result when applying an operation that inherently resolves to 24 in both divisible scenarios, without modifications or additional rules not outlined, doesn't align with the standard operation rule provided.\n\n**Speculative Interpretation (acknowledging the gap in the question's direct application):** If we consider the operation in a creative or puzzle context, the answer would be a speculative \"[[No Standard Solution]]\" due to the question's framing suggesting a departure from the standard operation rule's application rather than a direct numerical solution for X.\n\nIn a strictly educational context adhering to the given operation rule and the question's initial intention, the answer is \"[[Incorrect Application or Misunderstanding]]\" until a clarification or additional rule that allows X to satisfy the entire expression under the provided operation rule is provided."}

Evaluate \\(X※13\\):\n   - If \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, then \\(X※13 = \\frac{X}{13} + 2\\).\n   - If 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\), then \\(X※13 = \\frac{13}{X} + 2\\).\n   - If neither 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\) nor \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, then \\(X※13 = 24\\).\n\n2. Now, we have \\(19 ※28 ※4 ※24 = 3\\), given that we assumed \\(X※13\\) to be 24 for simplicity, as we are looking to solve for \\(X\\) and this step simplifies the initial evaluation process. This assumption is based on the premise that the operation's outcome leading to 3 requires a specific interplay of multiples and non-multiples among \\(X\\), 13, and the multiplying numbers in the sequence. Given the goal is to find \\(X\\), this approach allows us to directly focus on \\(X\\)'s relationship with 13 using the operation rule.\n\n3. Evaluate \\(28 ※4\\):\n   - Since 28 is a multiple of 4, \\(28 ※4 = \\frac{28}{4} + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9\\).\n\n4. Now, we have \\(19 ※9 = 3\\).\n   - Since 9 is not a multiple of 19 and 19 is not a multiple of 9, by the operation rule, \\(19 ※9 = 24\\).\n   - However, this leads to a contradiction because \\(19 ※9\\) cannot equal 3 if it's treated as a separate operation. The correct interpretation must consider the sequence and the goal to equate to 3, which prompts us to revisit the initial simplification assumption about \\(X※13\\) equaling 24.\n\nGiven the equation's setup and the goal to equate to 3, the critical misunderstanding in the direct solving process is the assumption that \\(X※13\\) directly contributes to the 3 without considering the entirety of the sequence's operation dynamics. The correct approach to solving for \\(X\\) directly within the context of the operation's rule and the equation's outcome of 3 requires a reevaluation of the problem's conditions under the operation rule.\n\nThe key to solving for \\(X\\) correctly within the given equation and the operation rule's constraints is to recognize that the equation's outcome of 3 forces \\(X\\) to be a value that, when paired with 13, adheres to the operation rule in such a way that the entire sequence equals 3. This involves finding \\(X\\) such that \\(X※13\\), under the operation rule, when incorporated into the sequence, leads to the equation's outcome of 3, considering the operation's behavior with respect to multiples and non-multiples.\n\nGiven the direct solving path leads to inconsistencies and the need to ensure the equation's outcome aligns with the operation rule's conditions, the solution involves:\n\n1. Recognizing that the assumption that \\(X※13 = 24\\), while a straightforward simplification, does not directly lead to a solvable scenario under the given equation and the operation rule's direct application.\n2. Understanding that the correct approach involves solving for \\(X\\) within the context of the operation rule and the equation's outcome, which requires a reevaluation of the problem's conditions under the operation rule.\n3. Specifically, finding an \\(X\\) such that \\(X※13\\), when plugged into the sequence, results in a sequence that, according to the operation rule, leads to an outcome of 3, considering all the operations' behaviors with respect to multiples and non-multiples.\n\nTherefore, directly providing a numerical answer based on the initially outlined solving steps is not feasible due to the误解 in the simplification strategy. The correct approach involves solving for \\(X\\) within the complex interplay of the operation rule's conditions and the equation's outcome, a process that does not neatly fit the sequential solving method outlined due to the misunderstanding in the initial simplification step.\n\nTo accurately solve for \\(X\\), one would need to systematically explore possible values of \\(X\\) that, when used in the operation \\(X※13\\), align with the operation rule to satisfy the entire sequence leading to the outcome of 3, considering all the nuances of the operation rule regarding multiples and non-multiples.\n\nGiven the initial incorrect simplification and the complexity of directly solving for \\(X\\) within the constraints of the operation rule and the equation's outcome, the answer as initially provided does not accurately solve for \\(X\\) due to the oversight in the solving methodology. The correct approach is more intricate, involving a deep dive into the interplay of \\(X\\)'s value with 13 under the operation rule to satisfy the entire sequence's outcome of 3, a process that necessitates a more detailed and methodical exploration of potential \\(X\\) values under the operation's conditions.\n\n**However, the essence of the task is to demonstrate the application of the operation rule and the methodology to approach such problems, even if a direct numerical answer cannot be provided due to the initial misunderstanding.**\n\nThe answer, therefore, cannot be simply represented as a numerical value based on the initial solving steps due to the incorrect simplification and the misunderstanding in applying the operation rule to the entire sequence. The correct approach is outlined in the guidance provided, emphasizing the need for a detailed exploration of \\(X\\)'s relationship with 13 under the operation rule to satisfy the entire sequence's outcome of 3, a process beyond the direct application of the operation rule to individual operations within the sequence as initially attempted."}

We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses: X ○ 3\n   According to the operation rule, this becomes (X+3 3)×(X+3) = (X+9)×(X+3)\n   Expanding this, we get X^2 + 12X + 27.\n\n2. Now, we apply this result to the operation with 5: 5 ○ (X^2 + 12X + 27)\n   Using the operation rule again, this becomes (5+3 X^2 + 12X + 27)×(5+X^2 + 12X + 27)\n   Simplifying and solving the equation for X, we get:\n   (X^2 + 12X + 32)×(X^2 + 12X + 32) = 63\n\n3.

Calculating the actual values for X (using a calculator to find the square roots):\n   X1 = [-12 + sqrt(16 + 12 sqrt(7))]/2 ≈ [-12 + 11.748]/2 ≈ 0.174\n   X2 = [-12 - sqrt(16 - 12 sqrt(7))]/2 ≈ [-12 - (-0.263)]/2 ≈ -5.868\n\n8.

If X is odd, it wouldn't be included in the average since we are only considering even numbers. Thus, X must be even for it to be included in the average.\n\nThe average of a set of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the count of the numbers. In the case of X#5, since we're averaging even numbers between X and 5 (inclusive), and knowing that the average is 3, which is an odd number, it's clear that there must be an odd number of terms in the sequence (because the average of any set of consecutive even numbers would also be even, with the exception when the set contains only one number, which is the case here).\n\nGiven that the sequence includes X and 5 (which are both odd, and we know from the rule that we include them if they are even), and we are averaging to get 3, this suggests that the sequence contains only one number, which must be 3 itself to make the average an even number (since 3 is the only even number in the sequence here due to X and 5 being odd and not fitting the condition unless X itself is 3).\n\nTherefore, X must be 3, as this is the only even number that, when used in the operation X#5, would result in an average of 3.\n\nThe answer is [[3]]."}

There are no other even numbers between 7 and itself (excluding 7). However, including X, which must also be an even number (since we're averaging even numbers), we need to find X such that the average of X, 6, 7 (though it's not strictly necessary for calculation since it's fixed), and 8 is 6.\n\nThe sum of these numbers (X, 6, 7, 8) should be \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\), because there are four numbers (X, 6, 7, 8), and their average is 6, as given by the operation X#7 = 6.\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[X + 6 + 7 + 8 = 24\\]\n\nSolving for X:\n\\[X = 24 - (6 + 7 + 8)\\]\n\\[X = 24 - 21\\]\n\\[X = 3\\]\n\nHowever, this contradicts the premise that X must be an even number (since we're averaging even numbers as per the operation definition). This initial approach misinterpreted the problem by not strictly adhering to the condition that X, 6, 7, and 8 are the numbers included in the operation X#7. Given the operation's requirement that only even numbers are averaged (and explicitly including 7, which complicates the direct approach), let's correct the approach by focusing on the even numbers exclusively.\n\nThe correct interpretation should only consider X and 8 as the numbers involved in the operation as defined by X#7, where 7 is included but its value doesn't affect the calculation directly except in terms of positioning X. Since 8 is the only even number outside the range defined by X and 7 that is explicitly part of the operation's calculation (due to the strict interpretation of averaging 'between' X and 7, inclusive of X but not of 7 in the pure mathematical sense of 'between' as used in the operation's definition), X must be 6 to maintain the even number average rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation to align with the operation's strict definition (ignoring the mathematical stricture of 'between' due to the operation's unique criteria of including only even numbers) is that X must be 6 to maintain the average at 6 when calculated with 7 and 8, despite the mathematical contradiction that 7, being odd, is not part of the average operation's designated set of even numbers strictly 'between' X and 7. The operation's definition dictates a calculation path that leads uniquely to X being 6 to satisfy the given condition.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[6]]"}

According to the rule, a ￠ b = log_b(a) + log_a(b). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nlog_X(512) + log_{512}(X) = 82 / 9\n\nWe also know that 512 = 2^9, so we can substitute 512 with 2^9:\n\nlog_X(2^9) + log_{2^9}(X) = 82 / 9\n\nUsing the power rule of logarithms (log_a(x^n) = n * log_a(x)), we can simplify the first term:\n\n9 * log_X(2) + log_{2^9}(X) = 82 / 9\n\nNow, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can first move the second term to the right side of the equation:\n\n9 * log_X(2) = 82 / 9 - log_{2^9}(X)\n\nNext, we can use the change of base formula to combine the logarithms with the same base:\n\n9 * log_X(2) = (82 / 9) * log_X(2^9) / log_X(2) - log_{2^9}(X)\n\nSince log_X(2^9) = 9 * log_X(2), we can substitute this expression back into the equation:\n\n9 * log_X(2) = (82 / 9) * (9 * log_X(2)) / log_X(2) - 9 * log_{2^9}(X) / log_X(2)\n\nWe can further simplify this equation by canceling out the log_X(2) terms:\n\n9 = 82 - 9 * log_{2^9}(X) / log_X(2)\n\nNow, we need to solve for the ratio of the two logarithms. Rearranging the equation:\n\n9 * log_{2^9}(X) / log_X(2) = 82 - 9\n\n9 * log_{2^9}(X) / log_X(2) = 73\n\nDividing both sides by 9:\n\nlog_{2^9}(X) / log_X(2) = 73 / 9\n\nNow, we can use the change of base formula in reverse to combine the two logarithms into a single logarithm:\n\nlog_2(X) / (1 / log_2(2^9)) = 73 / 9\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nlog_2(X) * log_2(2^9) = 73 / 9\n\nSince log_2(2^9) = 9, we can simplify the equation further:\n\n9 * log_2(X) = 73 / 9\n\nNow, we need to solve for log_2(X):\n\nlog_2(X) = (73 / 9) / 9\n\nlog_2(X) = 73 / 81\n\nFinally, we can solve for X by undoing the logarithm with base 2:\n\nX = 2^{(73 / 81)}\n\nTherefore, the value of X is 2^{(73 / 81)}.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer to be given as a number, so we can approximate the value of X:\n\nX ≈ 2^{(73 / 81)} ≈ 1.985\n\nSince X must be a positive integer, the closest integer value to 1.985 is 2.\n\n[[2]]"}

We have another operation to be performed on the result of 3¥X, which is ¥6:\n\n(3¥X)¥6 = (3^X - X^3) - 6^3\n\nNow we set this expression equal to -1:\n\n(3^X - X^3) - 6^3 = -1\n\nAdding 6^3 to both sides, we get:\n\n3^X - X^3 = 6^3 - 1\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n3^X - X^3 = 215\n\nNow we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation. Since it's a bit complex to solve algebraically, we can use trial and error or a numerical method to find the value of X. Testing values of X:\n\nFor X = 1: 3^1 - 1^3 = 3 - 1 = 2, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 2: 3^2 - 2^3 = 9 - 8 = 1, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 3: 3^3 - 3^3 = 27 - 27 = 0, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 4: 3^4 - 4^3 = 81 - 64 = 17, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 5: 3^5 - 5^3 = 243 - 125 = 118, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 6: 3^6 - 6^3 = 729 - 216 = 513, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 7: 3^7 - 7^3 = 2187 - 343 = 1844, which does not satisfy the equation.\nFor X = 8: 3^8 - 8^3 = 6561 - 512 = 6049, which does not satisfy the equation.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems there might have been an error in calculating the values for larger X. Let's correct the calculation for X = 5:\n\n3^5 - 5^3 = 243 - 125 = 118\n\nThis was correct as initially stated, and it does not satisfy the equation. The correct approach is to systematically test values until the equation is satisfied. Given the complexity and the need for exactness to satisfy the equation, we continue to test values. However, it's important to note that due to the iterative nature of this process, we might not cover all exact decimal points in a concise explanation, and this is a simplified representation of how one might approach such a problem.\n\nUpon further testing beyond what is straightforward here, one might find that the equation is satisfied at a value of X that is not a simple integer. The process involves iteratively testing values of X until the difference between 3^X and X^3 closely matches 215. For the sake of simplicity and without actual computation beyond X = 5, let's acknowledge that the correct integer value for X satisfying the equation 3¥X¥6 = -1 might not be immediately apparent without computational tools.\n\nGiven the iterative nature of finding X that satisfies the equation exactly as stated (3^X - X^3 = 215), and without resorting to computational tools for precise testing beyond the initial incorrect analysis, the exact integer value of X is not straightforwardly provided in this explanation. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the format requested and given the nature of the process (which ideally would involve a more detailed numerical or computational approach to find the exact integer solution), the answer process showcases the method rather than a specific, concise integer solution. The correct integer value for X that satisfies the equation 3¥X¥6 = -1 would typically be found through systematic testing or more advanced mathematical techniques.\n\nSince we cannot provide an exact integer solution without computational aid, and following the initial error in calculation correction, the concise answer in the requested format, acknowledging the need for computational verification, would be:\n\n[[The exact integer value of X cannot be definitively provided without computational tools; however, the process involves testing values of X starting from 1 upwards until the equation 3¥X¥6 = -1 is satisfied.]]."}

Therefore, the result of the operation A￡B is an empty set, as there are no extra positive numbers outside the natural numbers.\n\nSo, A￡B = ∅\n\nFinal Answer: [[∅]]"}
