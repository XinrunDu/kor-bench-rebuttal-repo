The first two examples demonstrate how to compute the new operation by adding 2 times the first matrix to 3 times the second matrix. The third and fourth examples showcase how to handle different matrix sizes and values within the operation.\n\nHowever, an issue arises in the final question, as the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, but the matrix B is a 2x1 column vector. This causes an error in the operation because the dimensions of the matrices are incompatible. In the context of the rule, A€B=2A+3B, B should be a matrix of the same size as A. Therefore, the rule cannot be applied accurately to questions involving matrices of different sizes."}
