Separate conditions with 'or' if there are multiple conditions.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[you answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To tackle this problem, we first need to understand the given sets and their definitions:\n\n- Set A: This is defined as containing all real numbers. In set notation, this can be represented as: $A = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\n\n- Set B: This is defined as containing all real numbers such that $x^2$ is less than 1. Written in set notation: $B = \\{x \\mid x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nNow, we need to perform the custom operation A￡B:\n\n$A￡B = (A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B)$\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n$A \\cup B$ - The union of sets A and B contains elements that are in either set A or set B (or in both). In this case, $A \\cup B$ will include all real numbers (as set A covers all real numbers) and also include the elements of set B (which is $x$ such that $x^2 < 1$). So, the union will be represented as $A \\cup B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ or } x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\n$A \\cap B$ - The intersection of sets A and B contains elements that are in both set A and set B. In our case, this will be elements that are real numbers and satisfy the condition $x^2 < 1$. This simplifies to $A \\cap B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 < 1\\}$.\n\nNow that we have these two sets, we can subtract the intersection from the union:\n\n$(A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B) = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ or } x^2 < 1\\} - \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 < 1\\}$\n\nTo determine this difference, we compare the two sets. Any element that is in the first set but not in the second set will be part of the final answer. In this case, the solution set will include all real numbers that are not in the intersection (i.e., not those satisfying $x^2 < 1$). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $A￡B = \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\text{ and } x^2 \\geq 1\\} =$ **[**$\\left\\{x \\mid x \\leq -1 \\text{ or } x \\geq 1\\right\\}$**]"}

In other words, it gives us the elements that are present in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nGiven:\nA = {x | x is a natural number}\nB = {x | x is positive}\n\nFirst, let's identify the elements in each set:\n- A: Contains all natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).\n- B: Contains all positive numbers (both natural numbers and positive fractions/decimals).\n\nNext, we find the elements that are common to both sets. These are the natural numbers that are also positive: The natural numbers themselves.\n\nNow, perform the operation:\nA￡B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nTo find their union (A ∪ B), we simply combine the elements of both sets: positive numbers, which includes all natural numbers, positive fractions, and positive decimals but no negative numbers or zero.\n\nTo find their intersection (A ∩ B), we consider natural numbers that are also positive: all natural numbers because they are inherently positive.\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n(Union) - (Intersection) = All positive numbers - {All natural numbers}\n= {All positive fractions and decimals}\n\nThe final answer consists of a collection of positive fractions and decimals, so the outcome can be a continuous set and not just a single number. Also, the notation used in the question, where the set definition is written, implies that the set could contain multiple elements, so the answer should be plural. Here it is:\n[[{Any positive fraction > 0, such as 0.5, 0.25, 2.34..., or any positive decimal, such as 0.389, 1.2345..., etc.}]]"}
