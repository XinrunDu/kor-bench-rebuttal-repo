Propositional Symbolization Rules:\n    - Equivalence is represented by `::=::`\n    - Negation is represented by `!`\n    - Or is represented by `|`\n    - And is represented by `&`\n    - Implication is represented by `>`\n    - Equivalence is represented by `=`\n    - NAND is represented by `\u21d1`\n    - NOR is represented by `\u21d3`\n2. Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nDuring a break at a seminar, three attendees tried to determine where Professor Wang is from based on his accent.

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nThe baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up. \u2192 The mother is the baby's mother.
