Then our equation becomes:\n   1/y + y = 5/2\n\n8) Multiplying both sides by y:\n   1 + y^2 = 5y/2\n\n9) Rearranging:\n   2y^2 - 5y + 2 = 0\n\n10) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n    y = (5 ± √(25 - 16)) / 4 = (5 ± 3) / 4\n\n11) The positive solution is y = 2\n\n12) Remember, y = log_2(X)\n\n13) Therefore, X = 2^2 = 4\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[4]]"}
