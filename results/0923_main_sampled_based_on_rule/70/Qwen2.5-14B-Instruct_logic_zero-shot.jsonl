If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false.

Thus, `(p>q)>r` becomes `(!!p | !q)|r`.\n\nBy the idempotence law (2-3), `!!p` can be simplified to `p`.\n\nSo, we have `(p | !q) | r` as our first expression.\n\nNext, for `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` translates directly using rule (10) to `!p | (q>r)`.\n2. Using rule (10) for the nested implication `(q>r)`, it becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nComparing the fully simplified forms:\n- `(p>q)>r` becomes `(p | !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo check equivalence, compare `(p | !q) | r` and `!p | (!q | r)` using the given equivalences.\n\n`(p | !q) | r` is not directly equivalent to `!p | (!q | r)` based on the provided equivalences without further steps, but we can see that neither expression directly simplifies or restructures into the other without additional transformations that aren't specified or straightforward under the given rules.\n\nGiven that through direct transformation, none of the provided equivalences directly confirm they are identical forms, and looking closely the structure of the expressions seems to hint towards different outcomes in certain scenarios (as `p` is negated in one and not the other), the conclusion leans towards them not being equivalent under all truth value scenarios.\n\n[[B]]"}

No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's break down each equivalence according to the given rules and see whether they are valid.\n\n### Sub-question (1)\nThe expression given is: `((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))`\n1. Express `>` using negation and disjunction:\n   - `p>q` can be rewritten as `!p | q` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n   - So, `((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))`\n2. Similarly, `p>(q|r)` can be rewritten as `!p | (q | r)` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n3. Now, let's compare `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` with `!p | (q | r)`:\n   - We can use equivalence (5) to simplify and compare.\n   - By equivalence (5), `!p & (!p | (q & r))` is simplified to `!p | (q | r)`.\n   - But the original expression is `(p>q)&(p>r)` which represents `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   - Analyzing further using Basic Equivalences doesn't simplify to `!p | (q | r)` directly.\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (1) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question (2)\nThe expression given is: `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`\n1. Express `=` using implication:\n   - From rule (11), `p = q ::=:: (!p | q) & (!q | p)`\n2. Negation of `p = q` means negating the implication formula:\n   - `!(p = q) ::=:: ! ((!p | q) & (!q | p))`\n   - Using De Morgan's Law (6 from Basic Equivalences), `!(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B`\n   - This gives us `! (!p | q) | ! (!q | p)`\n   - Applying De Morgan's Law again, `!!p & !q | !q &!!p`\n   - Simplifying `!!` by (1), `p & !q | !q & p`\n   - Which can be interpreted as `!(p&q) | (p|q)`\n   - This expression is equivalent to `(p | q) & !(p & q)`\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (2) is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer adhering to the given format would be: [[B];[A]]"}

So, what would the statements of First person, Second person, and Third person be represented as?\nAnswers are formatted as [[ ];[ ];[ ]]. Each bracketed section should contain the corresponding logical expression for each individual statement.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To represent the statements of the first, second, and third persons according to the given propositions (p for Suzhou, q for Shanghai, and r for Hangzhou), we can symbolize each statement according to the logic symbols provided.\n\n1. First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!p & q`.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & p`.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - Since exactly one among `p, q, r` is true, and according to the statement the person is claiming that it is neither `q` nor `r` (Shanghai nor Hangzhou). Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true. Hence, a fuller consideration of the third statement in the context of one of them being true will convert to `p | r`, thus `p` stands for the correct place if `q` and `r` are false. Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1. First person: `!p & q`.\n2. Second person: `!q & p`.\n3.

Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

We aim to identify the paired disjunctive terms and their representation according to the defined rules.\n\n1. **Identifying the Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - For \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment matches the binary 111 (hexadecimal 7), which does not directly correspond to a specific paired disjunctive term \\(M7\\). However, this is part of our conjunction, so we focus on the entire disjunction's impacting truth assignments, guided by the conjunction with \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\).\n    - For \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment mirrors the binary 101 (hexadecimal 5), leading to the term \\(M5\\).\n\n2. **Conjunction Analysis:**\n    - The conjunction of two disjunctions essentially means that the overall disjunction must satisfy the conditions of both disjunctions simultaneously. Given that both disjunctive forms have \\(r\\) as a constant variable, ensuring \\(r=1\\) is vital to satisfy the structure of each individual disjunct.\n    - The logical implication reduces our focus to the arrangement satisfying both cases, hence considering truth assignments aligning r=1.\n    - Truth assignments satisfying \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\wedge(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\) would yield the stable falsification intrinsic with \\(\\neg q\\) as a common link. Therefore, the fixed \\(r=1\\) and critical point is in \\(p, q\\), yielding the necessary term thorough specifically encompassing disjunctive falsification in combined leverage.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant falsifying assignment combining all constraints mainly concluding the essential truth adjusted alignment:\n- Focus on \\(\\neg q \\wedge r=1\\) determining primary falsifying boundaries for logic effective: \\(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q\\) simplifies likely to primary falsifying \\(5,7\\).\n\n3. **Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - The falsifying set through logical impact of \\(p, q\\) in conjunction core \\(M5, M7\\) remains significant.\n\n4. **Denotation:**\n    - Application of the notation rules, the principal disjunctive normal form incorporating the combined falsifying term ultimately matches such indications precisely:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5 + M7]] \\]\n\nHence, summarizing, we denote the expression as:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5, M7]] \\]"}

Given S2 remains \u2205, and there are no newly generated clauses to add to S1.\n\nSince after the first resolution loop iteration, no new clauses have been added to S2 from the application of the resolution rule:\n\n### Format Representation After the First Loop Iteration\nTherefore, the contents of S0, S1, S2 after the first loop iteration will also remain unchanged:\n\n```\n[\u2205;{\u00acp \u2228 q, p \u2228 q, q};\u2205]\n```\n\nThis concludes that during the first resolution iteration, there are no new clauses or conflicts generated, keeping S0, S1, and S2 as initialized."}

Since the format requires the use of 0-ary predicates, we treat 2 and 4 as specific instances that do not apply in a general sense through individual variables x and directly state their properties.\n\n(1) Since 2 is the only prime number in this context, we should somehow express that any entity x which is a prime (F(x)) is actually 2 (interpreted as a specific condition for 0-ary predicates). However, in order to adhere strictly to the instruction and using 0-ary predicates directly, we can symbolize F(2) as \"2 is a prime number\" and \u223cF(4) as \"4 is not a prime number\" (since 4 being a composite number implies it is not prime).

So it's equivalent to [1].\n- Thus, it translates to SAP.\n\n[4] Some products are unqualified.\n- Particular Negative (O): SOP.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationships as per the given guide:\n- [1] and [2] have * relation, as they are A and E, respectively. One is true if the other is false, and vice versa.\n- [1] and [3] are both SAP (Universal Affirmatives), meaning they're saying the same thing in different ways. Since they are logically equivalent and identical, they have a direct relationship, indicating they support each other in being true.\n- [3] and [4] seem to contradict each other at first glance since [3] (all products are qualified) and [4] (some products are unqualified) do not align; however, if looking strictly by the given classification rules and upon understanding [3] as SAP equivalent, they follow the % relation, where a universal proposition (SAP in [3]) being true means the particular (O in [4]) may be false. Conversely, if [4] is true, [3] must be false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is [[A];[A];[B]], as [1] and [2] have a clear relationship, [1] and [3] are identical and must have a relationship, while [3] and [4] do not have a direct contradictory relationship as per % relation but aren't guaranteed to directly follow as in * or # relation. Hence [3] and [4], when strictly queried for direct \"agreeing\" or \"disagreeing\" relationship, skew towards being separate, indicated by [B]."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIf the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is what?\nIf the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is what?\nIf the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\nIf the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[true/false];[true/false];[true/false];[true/false]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, we need to understand the logical relationships between direct propositions as specified in the provided logical forms and relationships.\n\n1. If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, SAP is false as it directly contravenes SEP.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific truth-values based on provided relationships and the direct negation/intent of universal and particular propositions' implications:\n\n[[true];[false];[false];[false]]\n\nThis conclusion adheres to the given rules and logical forms specified."}

Conversion: Exchange the subject and predicate to get \"All not-upright and not-open are not true revolutionaries\".\n\nHowever, to match the exact phrase \"All people who are not upright and open\", we can interpret the obversion as turning into the contrary, and simplifying the statement to reflect the original meaning after conversion.

The inference \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be symbolized as $!q \u2192 !p, but more closely aligns with being a direct transformation of the necessity to a specific form of impossibility, which directly corresponds to formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p once we correctly map the logical flow and understand that the negation and modal transformations align with turning necessity into a form that denies the possibility of the negation directly resulting. However, according to the specific inference asked from the given statement to the conclusion, the exact formula being matched directly in the modal logic inference formulas provided is #p \u2192 $p, which is formula (9). The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked."}

This implies that it's not necessary for a person to pull their own hair and leave the earth at the same time, which aligns with the modal logic inference formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p. Since we negate the necessity, the formula is applied in its direct form, indicating that if something is not necessarily true (#p \u2192 !#!p), it can infer that it's not necessarily necessarily true, which closely corresponds to the given inference.

Team A might not have won the championship.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statement \"Team A did not win the championship\" can be represented as !p, where p stands for \"Team A won the championship\". According to the truth modal reasoning formula 16, which states that !p \u2192 $!p, if Team A did not win the championship, then it follows that Team A might not have won the championship (or more accurately in this context, it is possible that Team A did not win the championship, which aligns with the fact that they did not win).\n\nHowever, the formulation here implies a reflection of the situation using modal logic: it confirms the given situation while aligning with one of the answer choices by identifying that based on the given fact, it is stated in a possible modality, which is closest to the wording in option D \"Team A might not have won the championship\" but more precisely it confirms the given negation as a possibility.\n\nGiven the options and the direct translation of the modal logic formula, the answer should reflect a corresponding possibility statement.\n\nThe closest answer to the formulation of possible outcomes in modal logic is:\n\n[[D]]"}

The negation, \"Old Li's health was not very good in the past,\" can be represented as \"A\u00acp\".\n- Based on the time proposition relationships, \"A\u00acp\" and \"Ap\" fall under the \u21a6 Relationship (Rule 2) because they cannot both be true, but they can both be false.\n\nFor \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and \"Allow the execution of contracts\":\n- \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" can be represented as \"A\u00acq\", implying that at no point did she win the award in the past.\n- \"Allow the execution of contracts\" doesn't relate directly to any of the given time propositions. For this question, we're only comparing the two statements to each other based on the rules we have. Since there's no direct time-related statement contrast provided here, and the question asks for an implicit relationship using the same logic framework, we may infer that they're independent statements, falling under a non-interactive relationship which is closest represented by the \u2042 Relationship (Rule 4) where both statements (or lack thereof) can be true or false independently.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[D]]"}

Specifically, \"It is not true that Xiao Lin will never win\" can be understood as a negation that overcomes the never, thus leaving us with a positive statement about the future - \"Xiao Lin will win\". Since we're dealing with the negation structure, in terms of time relations, this takes the form of \"\u00acG\u00acp\", which by formula (16) is equivalent to \"Fp\".\n\nTherefore, for the first pair, we're dealing with \"Fp\" and \"Fp\", which, however, was not directly included in the given relationships but follows the logic implied by relationship (3) \u26ad, as it states that \"Fp and F\u00acp cannot both be false.\" The direct application here can be tricky, as it implies a self-relation that is true by the \u26ad rule, meaning it can both be true.\n\n(2) For \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\", we denote this as \"Gp\", a future period statement.\nFor \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\", which is more about a future point in time, we denote this as \"Fp\".\n\nLooking at the relationships defined:\n- The pair \"Gp and Fp\" fits the description of the fourth relationship (4) \u2042 which allows both statements to either be true or false simultaneously.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1) The first pair (Fp \u2194 Fp) falls under the \u26ad Relationship as they can both be true (as per (3)).\n(2) The second pair (Gp \u2194 Fp) fits the \u2042 Relationship as per rule (4).\n\nFinal Answer: [[C];[D]]"}

One group has salivary glands removed, and the other does not. Both groups are then bruised, and the result is observed. \n\n1. Positive group (with salivary glands intact): \n    - Salivary glands present, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal at a normal rate.\n2. Negative group (with salivary glands removed): \n    - Salivary glands absent, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal much slower.\n\nThis scenario closely matches Method \ua66e from the logic rule provided. Here, the salivary glands are the condition S, and the rate of wound healing is the outcome P. The positive group shows that when salivary glands are present (S), the wounds heal at a normal rate (P). The negative group shows that when salivary glands are absent (S'), the wounds heal slower (P'). Since the groups are identical in all other respects (A, B, C, D, E, F differing only in the salivary glands condition), the method is applied correctly, leading to the inference that salivary glands may have a causal relationship with the rate of wound healing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[C]]."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The causal derivation described in the passage corresponds to the identification of an unexpected outcome after the removal of a known factor (uranium in this case), leading to the discovery of another factor (the radioactive element radium or polonium) contributing to the observed phenomenon (radioactivity). This matches the characteristic of the \ua66e method, where the absence of one factor (S) leads to the absence of the effect (P) in the negative group, indicating a causal link.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n[[C]]"}

However, this expression does not fully capture the essence of the LS Paradox.

The given expression only shows a contradiction between two hypotheses, without involving a third hypothesis that introduces further contradiction when combined with the first two.

However, the question appears to expect a categorization. Given that the minimalization criterion could suggest a slight relationship with C% due to the statement involving the minimal information \"the beer is warm,\" but ultimately expanding the definition of what \"food\" is, the closest alignment would be with the principle that aims for clarity and relevancy of information conveyed rather than a direct inference jump. \n\nStill, considering options and the alignment that could loosely frame the minimal informativity of the statement, the answer should be considered in terms of the closest logical fit within provided constraints.

In the scenario described, one might infer that the \"mother\" is indeed the \"baby's mother,\" but this inference is based on the hearer's assumptions and expanded understanding beyond what is explicitly stated to infer a likely relationship rather than on the form of the sentence itself or any specific linguistic criterion related to the principle structure provided.\n\nGiven the described principles:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle focuses more on the limitation of information inferred from what is known by the speaker and not weakening information. The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate. This aligns closely with the question as the inference made assumes the least necessary meaning from the relationship described (that the woman picking up the baby is the baby's mother).\n\nTherefore, the principle most directly applicable here is the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]"}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !

To prove: p (The original proposition we want to prove is \"p.\")\n2. Assume: Not p (We start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, which is \"not p.\")\n3. Prove: If Not p, then q (We determine what would follow if \"not p\" were true.)\n4. Not q (We then show that what follows under the assumption of \"not p\" is not true, i.e., \"q\" is not true.)\n5. Therefore, Not (Not p) (Since the assumption of \"not p\" leads to a contradiction (Not q when we assumed If Not p, then q), we conclude that the assumption \"not p\" cannot be true.)\n6.

The initial statement \"Some students are doctors\" can be represented as \u2203x (Student(x) \u2227 Doctor(x)). The erroneous inference \"Therefore, some students are not doctors\" can be represented as \u2203x (Student(x) \u2227 \u00acDoctor(x)), which is not logically deducible from the initial statement.

This scenario describes a situation where knowledge about individuals is incorrectly attributed or assumed based on the facts, without proper justification for Xiao Qiang's knowledge of this specific relationship.\n\nThe issue here aligns with the `InvSubError` method, which indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about one subject to another.
