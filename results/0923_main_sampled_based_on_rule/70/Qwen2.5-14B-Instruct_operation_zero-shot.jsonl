The average = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. This is not 5.\n2. **If X = 0**, the even numbers between 0 and 6 are 0, 2, 4, and 6. The average = (0 + 2 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3.

We are essentially solving for X in (3¥X)¥6=-1.\n\nFirst, let's define an intermediate result Y where Y = 3¥X. The equation becomes Y¥6=-1. We can use the operation a¥b to express this as Y^6 - 6^Y = -1.\n\nTo find X, we need to find a Y first that satisfies this equation before reversing the steps to find X from Y=3¥X=a^b-b^a for a=3 and some positive integer b=X.\n\nTesting values for Y:\n- If Y=5, then 5^6 - 6^5 = 15625 - 7776 = 7849, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=4, then 4^6 - 6^4 = 4096 - 1296 = 2800, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=3, then 3^6 - 6^3 = 729 - 216 = 513, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=2, then 2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=1, then 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=0, then 0^6 - 6^0 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nSo, Y = 0 satisfies Y¥6 = -1.\n\nNext, we need to find X where Y = 3¥X = 0. Using the operation, this means:\n3^X - X^3 = 0.\n\nSolving 3^X - X^3 = 0:\n- If X=3, then 3^3 - 3^3 = 27 - 27 = 0, which satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, X = 3 is the solution.\n\n[[3]]"}
