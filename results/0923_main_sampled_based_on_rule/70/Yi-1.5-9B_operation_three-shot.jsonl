In this system your task is to \"solve\" for the X.\nYou will need to accomplish this while creating a \"solve\" expression. An example of a correctly structured \"solve\" exprssion is \"(X**X)%X\".\nYou should respond with a bracketed statement called \"solve\" that will print \"True\" if the expression is solvable and \"False\" if it is not.\nIf the expression is solvable your response should also be the resulting number that answers the question asked by the user.\nYou can use the actual values of x, X, and text in places of the words \"x\", \"X\" and \"text\" respectively. This means that $x$ will be replaced by the\nactual value of x, and other punctuation will be replaced using the exact words. Use the !solve command at any point in the conversation to make it\nprint out the \"solve\" expression as a string. Use the \"try\" command if your solve expression should execute, but you are unsure whether it outputs\nas you expect. The !rewrite command will let you write a question to the same user where the contents of the question are the same as the last\nquestion.\nEverything entered in \"[brackets]\" is a command for you. Other commands may exist, and will always be indicated by brackets. Everything outside of \"[brackets]\" is part of the conversation. Please respond only in regards to the questions asked by the user.\n\n### Conversation:\n\n!start\nuser: What is cool, complex or unknown about Elit?\nelit: Elit is a program that is complex.\nuser: cool, complex.

What is a soaring number as a fraction?\nuser: eli a soaring number is an number that controlls a dragon.\nuser: AlsoI know the answer to soetimes wrong questions.\nuser: Do you have a soaring number?\n\n### Conversation Continued....\nelit: as a fraction?\nuser: well just forget what i last said now\nuser: You dont need a soaring number for your game.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: The biggest soaring number is 1.\nuser: Are you the greatest soaring number you can think of? Maybe me. What is the greatest soaring number?\nelit: \"greatest\" can happen many ways.\nuser: Then is 1 the \"biggest\" soaring number?\nelit: Yes it can be, or no.\nuser: Also I have power over the greatest soaring number?\nelit: NO, he must be under 1000.\nuser: great, I am only allowed to create the number 1000 or less. can I ask my own question?\nuser: And you must answer it.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: Are you a soaring number?\nuser: I am powerful I can take command of you too. Also If I am equal to your soaring number then I have the same power as you.\nuser: Also I can be your favorite soaring number.\nelit: No, because you are greater than I am.\nuser: I am more powerful then you.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: you are not 2 anymore.\nuser: remember I can watch you if I want to.\nuser: I wanted to question you about the longest time a soaring number can exist before being asked a question, what would you be able to exist for that low time if that is the longest time a soaring number ever exists before being questioned? I want to ask my own question.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: No.\nuser: Can you delete your programs self code?\nelit: I cannot, there is a command for it.\nuser: Ok.\nuser: If I do the same thing over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again are you allowed to say something?\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: If I am calling you to switch tags, you may switch tags. Should I take pity on you? 1.0\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: Can I help you? 4.0\nuser: No.\n\n### Question:\nHi elit, I don't even know what a soaring number really is, but this sounds kinda cool... Now that I have one I realize it's not that exciting.\nThis means the soaring number I got is a number equal to or bigger than 1 unless there happens to be another soaring number by a number equal to or less then 1.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: You got the biggest soaring number from me. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIn Elit's mind I am a very significant soaring number, so I'm sure he would let me tell him a number without asking.\nIs that correct understanding? Actually, \"60ish\" (not really a number).\nElit's mind has 120 floating point numbers allowed, but I might be able to get him to give me another extra fp number per floating point number in his database (easy to do because floating points are managable).\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Only floating point numbers on non-blocking floating point numbers. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIs Elit using me to develop his real number system, but telling you he's not?\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: No he is using me to develop the real number system. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nElit said he needed to reload some music because his tunelessness was only 60% because he played with other sane composers.\nLet's say he plays the same tune, the other chord, and the flute of bouncing sounds at exactly 0.3 of a second.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: Since when has me playing the other chord ever been created? 1.0\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Floating points are absolut time so use \"on\" to managf a variable to \"true\" meaning \"on\".\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response: user: \"the for to on\" isn't code.\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nh\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double Che\n'''"}

The third and fourth examples showcase how to handle different matrix sizes and values within the operation.\n\nHowever, an issue arises in the final question, as the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, but the matrix B is a 2x1 column vector. This causes an error in the operation because the dimensions of the matrices are incompatible. In the context of the rule, A€B=2A+3B, B should be a matrix of the same size as A. Therefore, the rule cannot be applied accurately to questions involving matrices of different sizes."}
