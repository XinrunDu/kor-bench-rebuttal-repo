If there is only one case given, then just write a label A or B.\n\n### Answer:\n[[x is a even number|x<5|x is the number 5]];\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is a T, F, or G formula by giving a reason for your answer.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThe formula is T.\n\n### Question:\nDeterming the truth value of the following formula for given p1, p2, and p3\nFormat: [[T/F]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[T/F]].\n\nNotice:\nNo judgments such as \"not\" or \"not-not is given, so please answer as following:\n(1) If it's not truth formula, answer \"F\";\n(2) If it is a truth formula, but it is also not a judgment formula, then answer \"T\" (it is possible that it is both a truth formula and has a judgment such as \"not but it is not a judgment\", but the judgment formula is just a structural combination of the truth formula, and its truth value depends on the truth value of its structural parts.  However, different from the answer to the first type of question);\n(3)If it is a judgment formula, answer \"F\".\n\n### Question:\nAssume that there are the propositions \"1(p1)=1\"(&p2=1x=1)&~p2=1 & p2~=1), three axioms A, B and C and the induction axioms Ia and Ib.\nIf q is the formula \"(x^x)(x=0&x=1)\",  and q1 is \"q is a truth formula\", what will be the result of q1?\nThe answer should be a single integer. Since the possibility of answers (1~,0,~1,~2,~3 are all in the range [1...10], the format of the answer is [[N]]. There cannot be a N is 0 integer answer, so Q.I.A is not accepted.\n\n### Answer:\n[5];\n\n### Question:\nPlease find the result of the formula (p) under given value of x and the variables in the formula.\n\nThe result of the variable in the formula should be given as an integer, if there are multiple results you may use (;) to separate. The format for answer should be [[x];[result]].\n\nIn example please find out the answer of:\n(x+2)=(p;x=3)\n\nNote that:\nAll of the possible answers that we need are: [0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19].\nSo answers[0] = x+2 = 5 and answers[2] = x+2 = 4. If an answer[n] = 0, then when x is 0, it should be 0. \nThis is to differentiate the answers from the above possible answers.\nSo normally it should be at this:\n answers[0] = x+2 = 5;\n answers[1] = x+2 = 11;\n answers[2] = x+2 = 7.\n\n## Instructions:\n\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Carefully read the specific rules and symbols of this specialized logic [https://www.quora.com/ai/What-are-the-rules-when-writing-a-logical-expression-in-Coq/answer/Wu-Hen/1].\n2. After you have finished solving, you can check your results using the same data from an online verification tool [[https://easylogic.org/veryeasylogis]] (You can download the interface image in the end of this part). \n   *This interface can verify your results, but cannot verify your reasoning steps. If you write the logic on your documents and you think you are correct, then you fill this result in the box and copy the logic and reasoning to the report`s report document.\n\nIf you have any questions the online verification tools, you may bring up your problem in this slack group.\n\n**Reminder**\nIf there is a multiple result, you should also fill all of the possible results here, please not only fill a multiple-selection results(or none of them).\nThe order of the possible answer may be sorted, and **do not** take it as the ordered priority.\n\n## Check & Evaluation\n\nIf you encounter any problem then you might post your question in this Slack Group here: \n\n"}

None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, \u00ac(p\u2227q)\u2227\u00acw can be written either as \u00acp\u2227\u00ac\u00acq\u2227\u00acw [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or \u00acp\u2227(\u00acq\u2227\u00acw) \u2228 \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acw (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of \u00acp\u2194p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, \u00acp\u2228\u00acq is logically equivalent to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq. In contrast, \u200b\u00ac(p\u2228q)\u00acr\n][1] is not a logical implication of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u00acr because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition \u00acp\u2228q\u00acr can be reduced to \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2228\u00acr.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p\u2228\u00acp^(\u00acq\u2227\u00acr) -p^\u00acq^\u00acr (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p\u2228\u03c8` the [`p\u2227\u00ac\u03c8\u2019 `p\u2227\u03c8](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & \u00acA)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P \u2228 Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. \u00acQ (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q \u2228 \u00acP (disjunction). When it is true \u00ac(\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) is true \u2227(\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ)] (logical \u2228). When it is true ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q)) = \u00acP \u2228Q] ((\u00ac(\u00ac P \u2227 \u00ac Q) = P \u2228 Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P \u2228 Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A \u2228 \u2227(B \u2228 C ... N.) for the DNF `(A \u2228 (B \u2228 (C \u2228 ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) \u2228/\u2228[(X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z \u2228 ... N. \u2228 X \u2228 Y). \u2228 (X \u2228 Y \u2228 Z ... N) \u2228X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p\u2227q\u2227r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p \u2227 (q \u2227 r))))) \u2227((q \u2227 (p \u2227 r))) \u2227((r \u2227 (p \u2227 q)))] \u2227((r \u2227 (p & (q \u2227 r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p \u2227 Q)(p \u2227 R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P \u2228 Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: \u00ac(\u00acA\u2227\u00acB)\u2192(A\u2228B) ((\u00ac A\u2228\u00ac B)\u2192( A\u2227 B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P \u2228 Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q\u2227\u00acr&\u00acq\u2227r^(\u00ac\u00acp\u2228\u00acp\u2227r\u2227\u00acr\u2227p^(\u00acp\u2227\u00acr^(\u00ac\u00acq^\u00acp^(\u00acr\u2227\u00acq)))>= (p\u2227\u00ac\u00acp\u2227\u00acq)^p\u2227q\u2227\u00acr`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. \u00acP \u2228(P^\u00ac\u00acQ))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\uff1a\u7f16\u5199\u7b26\u5408\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n\n- \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u5e76\u5199\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u4e2d\u3002\n> \u8f93\u5165\uff1a \u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u683c\u5f0f`[\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **\u95ee\u9898**: `[\u201c**Output:**\u201d\uff0c\u683c\u5f0f\uff1a\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> \u5c06\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u914d\u7f6e\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u6d41\u8f93\u5165`[\u201c'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `\u8f93\u51fa`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n\u7528[0]\u4e2d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n\n\n## \u7f16\u8bd1\u9009\u9879\uff1a\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# \u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n## 1). \u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). \u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u5b57\u8f93\u5165([LNOT^2\u548ccalculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). \u903b\u8f91\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). \u7f16\u8bd1\u53c2\u6570,\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd4\u56de([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)"}

If x is a circle, x is a sphere.\nIllustration:\nFor each circle x,x is like a sphere, because every circle can be like the Sun when the Earth is stationary.\nAnalysis: If an object x meets the definition of 'circle', and it is still consistent with this definition after adding x has \"capacity to revolve\", then x also coincides with the definition of 'circle' after the change. Therefore, x cannot be a sphere.\nProof:\n1. If x is a circle, then it also has \"capacity to revolve\".\n2. If a circle has 'capacity to move freely', it is the Sun.\n3. If an object x is the Sun, then x is a sphere.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n\n\n2. If x is a quadrilateral, x cannot be a regular one.\nIllustration:\nTake the square as an example, the sides of the square form a regular quadrilateral, but they are not a regular one.\nAnalysis: The definition of 'circle' has a number of conditions to satisfy, to ensure the meaning of 'circle', which is consistent with some rules of 'circle'. The definition of 'quadrangular' has a number of conditions to satisfy, but it is not based on the combination of some concepts to form a regular one, because there is no combination of two or more sets of 'triangle', and squares are all quadrilaterals , so it is a kind of regular one, not conform to a definition of 'quadrangular'.\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrilateral, then x has at least one of the 4 types of 'triangle', the regular one included.\n2. If x has 'triangle', and it is a regular one, then x agrees with the definition of 'quadrangular' but is not a regular one.\n3. Therefore, if x is not a quadrilateral, then it cannot be a regular one.\nConclusion: If x is a quadrilateral, then x cannot be a regular one.\n\n\n3. All quadrangles (are) quadrilateral?\nIllustration:\nSquares, trapezoids, rhombi are all quadriangular, but not just added.\nAnalysis: quadrilateral(is)quadrangular(be) can be regarded as a conclusion. Its entry must agree with the definition of quadrangle (or triangular), can be interpreted as saying that a quadrilateral is quadrilateral absolutely correct. Since the squares' definition is the combination of regular tetrahedron and diagonal triangle, since the two pieces of a regular tetrahedron embedded in this tetrahedral combination and the line of two of the corners of the rhombus are the sum of the diagonal triangle's description, is consistent with the definition of triangular, which is called a quadrangle absolutely correct from quadrilateral definition. So the correct one conclusion is truly the meaning quads(is)quadrangular(be)\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrangle, then it must be a combination of quadrilateral or triangular.\n2. If x is a combination of quadrilateral, x is quadangled.\nConclusion: x is a quadrilateral wherever it is.\n\n### Question:\nProve the following propositions using analytical and judgment principles (3 hypotheses and 1 conclusion).\n\n1. If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n2. If x is a sphere, then x is a planet.\n3. If x is a planet, then x has an orbital ring around it.\n\nA total of 3 propositions must be proven. Prove the following 3 pairs of propositions in order using the Homological Domain:\n\n(1) 1 and 3 (2) 1 and 2 (3) 2 and 3\n\nDetermine which combinations can be proved at a time. Do not repeat the same proposition or use the same proposition combination twice (such as using the statement\"if A, then B\" and \"if B, then A\" in the same part). Assuming that your reasoning order and the verification of the principle sequence of the conditions will be considered during the examination of non-mathematical errors, such as arbitrary creation of Proposition, intentional reversal of inference, and substitution of the conclusion of a statement with a false proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n1. If x is not the sphere, then it is the sun.\nIllustration:\nLet the circle be the sun, as the sun, with a ring of orbital mirror around the edge, and there is a circle, which is not just a planet. If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\nAnalysis:\n If x is a circle, by definition, x is not just a sun and a spherical surface with an interstellar ring around the edge.\nIf x is a sphere, and x has a spherical surface, a belt is hanging around, and the edge is oval, x is a planet.\nIf x is a planet, then the spiral has to be around it too.\nProof:\n1. If a circle is not a sphere, the sun is not obviously.\n2. If x is a sphere with a ring of orbital mirrors like the sun, x is clearly a planet.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\n\n2. If x is not the planet, then x is a cube.\nIllustration:\nThe diameter of the planet is an arm\u2019s distance, and its outer edge is an arm\u2019s distance.\nAnalysis:\nIf the planet is not a sphere, the diameter of the planet cannot be an arm\u2019s distance, so a planet can be small that can accommodate the body. If x is a sphere, and x has an oval outer surface, the width of x\u2019s radius is smaller than an arm, so the outer hex radius can also be smaller than an arm\u2019s distance. Therefore, x is not the cube (is not a sphere or planet (is) cube).\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, it is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a sphere with a belt-like ring around its legs, then it must be the cube, because the radius is smaller than the arm.\nConclusion: If x is a planet, then x is a cube.\nConclusion: x can not be the cube.\n\n3. If x is not the cube, then x has a memory.\n1. Every continent has enough room to hold half of the world.\n2. Only the space on the bottom of the world and in orbits is available, so if anything exists in the universe, there must be something in the orbit.\nAnalysis:\nIt may be a cube, it has no core;\nbecause the volume of the cube is very large, it cannot be stored within three continents, which is too small. Therefore, the only possibility is that there is no core to make the volume look huge.\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, x is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a planet\u2019s spherical surface, orbiting x orbit 1 is absolutely impossible and can be ruled out, so x must be x, so x is the Sun.\n3. If x is a sphere orbiting x, then it must be a planet, and it is impossible to have a planet within the orbiting distance, so x is not a permanent one.\nConclusion: If x is a cube, then x has a core.\nConclusion: x is not a cube.\nWith the combination of propositions is not enough to prove.\n1, 2, 3 are sufficient conditions/not enough conditions, they can only prove a relationship between proposition/can not prove the truth of the combination of propositions, need to use the corresponding way to proved to be not enough to prove truth.\n\n### Question:\nSymbolise and verify the following proposition using the analytical principle (analogy principle) and judgment principle (proof by contradiction principle).\n\n(1) (A1 v A 2) \u21d2 ((( A 2 \u039b A 1) \u039b (( A 1 \u039b A 2) \u039b ( A 1 \u039b A 2))) \u039b (( A 1 \u039b A 2) \u039b ( A 1 \u039b A 2)\n\n(2) A 2\u039b(A 1 \u039b("}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S**\u00a0is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C**\u00a0is what?\n4. **Q**\u00a0is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "\"\"\"[[/]]\n\n"}

At some later point in time, they will move to a new house.\n\n#### [## Example\n\nIf a = Fp and b = H\u00acp, What is the result of applying the logical opsap to \"a\" and \"b\"?\n\nThe result of logical opsap \"a\" and \"b\" is \"a\".\n\nHow do you represent the relationship as in the image?\n\nAssume that you own a garage of your own. This is commonly known as your \"garage\". A garage is something you own, so it's a property of yours.\n\nA garage can be a property of a specific object, i.e. your car.\ngpa, HP and Hp are properties that I own about my garage. They are all used in both \"owner\" and \"garage\".\n\nPlease comment how you would write the formula after applying Booleans and logical terms.\n\nI've tried to show the relationships by writing each pair in a certain order.\nI don't know what you meant by \"relationship.\" I thought you meant relationships between variables.\n\nFor instance, in \"My house is white\", R could be referred to as \"the roof\", \"the walls\", etc.\n\nDo you mean the same thing \"Gpa, Hpa and Hp\" apply to \"B\"?\n\nFor example, the house is one object where the \"Gpa\" applies. 1a is the reality and 1b is the house property.\n\nThe house itself is also an object. \"Gpa\" is a property of the house.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"the relationship\"?\n\nThe house's roof is yellow.\n\"Hp\" (Hpa\" and \"Hpa\")\n\nThere is one yellow thing that belongs to the house.\narea\n(Area) (Area)\n\n1a is a house owner. If the house is yellow or not, how would you express this as a reasoning formula?\n\nI don't think it's necessary to refer to it as the \"relationship.\"\n\n1a and 1b are just examples. There are 2 objects: the house and another object. Please proceed with your logic in the formula.\n\nHow could you write the formula using the \"relationship\" of the \"relationship\"?\n\nThe relationship also includes the house. The house can appear if you own it.\n\nI am sorry for delaying. 1a and 1b are examples of the two variables A and B in \"The house is either white or yellow\".\n\nYou said you wanted a new understanding of the relationship. You need an understanding of the two variable \"a\" and \"b\" relationships. \"a\" and \"b\" are the two different variables.\n\nHow can you show that the relationship has occurred? We have to write how you can find out the relationship.\n\nFor instance if \"a\" and \"b\" are the two variables, how can it be shown to be \"a\"?\n\nFor example, the house will be yellow if either building or garage is white. \"A\" would either be \"white\" or \"yellow\", either be white or yellow.\n\nI could think of two ways to think about it.\n1st: \"The house can be either white or yellow.\"\n2nd: \"The house could be white.\"\n\nThe first way is similar in your example, but it's not possible to write the second way.\n\nThe house, as you know, is a typical object with four walls, a roof, and so on.\n1a is \"the roof\".\nIs there a way to show that the house only exists \"if\" or \"only\" or \"without\" the first variable?\n\nThe word \"only\" is different. \"The roof\" can also be \"Only\" when applied to \"roof\".\nThe word \"before\" can be applied to \"roof. It can also be used for the house.\n\nThe second way also works. The house is white because it has no other attribute.\n1b is the \"wall\".\n\nThe rule of the house's relationship\n1a and 1b have to be one of the two variables.\n\nIn English, I understand it to mean, \"The house only has either white or yellow roof.\"\n\nIn English, I understand the same way, but here it's written in an explicit way.\n\"A\" is the property of the house.\n\nYou can't say a lot about the house, but you can say about the \"roof\" of the house - \"Gpa\"; (\"A\" is the property of the house\"\n\nThe rule of the house relationship\n1a and 1b must both be one of them.\n\nDue to your explanation, I have come to the conclusion that you really want to learn how to write a logical formula involving two variables and their relationships.\n\nPlease find the appropriate solution from the ones above.\n\n## Example\n\nWhat are the results of applying Logical Operation I, II, III, IV respectively to \"a\" and \"b\" using the image below?\n\nThe result of \"a\" with I.\nThe result of \"a\" with II.\nThe result of \"a\" with III.\nThe result of \"a\" with IV.\n\nThe relationship of a and b.\n\nI could explain how to think about the relationship between \"a\" and \"b.\"\nPlease make sure you can understand how the formula will be written.\n\nBy the way, what I think a and b can be?\nThe two variable I think is \"a\" and \"b\".\n\nWhat are \"a\" and \"b\"?\nThe relationship is defined using \"a\" and \"b\" as variables.\n\nNow, I am able to correctly understand how you write a logical formula for \"relationship\" or how to clearly communicate the concepts of mathematics.\n\nEven though your explanation was clear and we are both agreed, thank you for the time you took us on it.\nI tried to organize it to resemble a tutor. I hope you understand.\n\n### Main Details Include:\n1. It contains the main logical formulas that you will see.\n2. The example is used to illustrate the main logical formulas.\n3. The example also shows how to apply logical formulas to variables.\n\nWhat is the relationship?\n\nThe image shows a relationship. The image shows how two different variables have each other's relationships.\n\nThe relationship \"relationship\"\n\nThe relationship is also used between two variables.\n\nThe relationship between a and b\n\n1. 1a, 1b\n\n2. The relationship \"a\" is to be shown as a result of 1a and 1b.\n\nIf 1a and 1b have an example, but how can you both be true?\n\nYou can think of the relationship between two variables.\n\nExample:\nA house is always white.\nA garage is always yellow.\n\nExample:\nA roof is yellow.\nThe wall of a garage is white.\n\nThe relationship between a and b\n\n1. 1a is \"The roof is white.\"\n2. Gpa is one of the relationships between 1a and 1b.\n3. L is not the relationship between 1a and 1b.\n\nExample:\n1a is \"the roof is white.\"\n1b is \"The Roof is white too.\"\n\n1a is the white roof.\n1b is the yellow house.\n\"L\" is the property of 1a."}

[c1 + c2]\u03c6\n  - The possibility exists that `\u03c6` is true after executing one or both commands.\n3. [c1; c2]\u03c6\n  - After executing the commands, `\u03c6` has the characteristics of both `c1` and `c2`.\n4. \u27e8c1; c2\u27e9\u03c6\n  - After executing `c1`, the situation after executing `c2` can be represented as if `\u03c6` is true.\n5. \u27e8c1 + c2\u27e9\u03c6\n  - Any of the processes `c1` or `c2` makes `\u03c6` possible.\n6. [[c1; c2]\u03c6]\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can be represented as `\u03c6`.\n7. [c1; c2]\u03c6\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can contain or include `\u03c6`.\n\nThis may sound more convoluted, but it is the result of a series of transformations based on the structure of the rule language. The basic idea is to use logical operations such as substitution, sequence, choice, loop, and interrupt as a process or description of execution. For example, when executing command `c2 + c1`, the first command is likely to be completed successfully, then execute the second command, the resulting situation will be as if `\u03c6` is true. In a broader sense, even when `c1` succeeds, `\u03c6` is still possible, because after using `c1 + c2`, the system can still enter the resource limitation state and then the exception state, which will lead to `errorCode`. Finally, when executing the command `c1; c2`, the outcome can be described as `\u03c6` plus both `c1` and `c2`, and the successful execution can result in termination or the situation as if `\u03c6` is true.\n<img src=\"https://img2.imgso.cn/flow/e476b21f247217727d793596488/jionefh66.png\" width=\"800\" border=\"0\" />"}

If someone makes mistakes in their research and the mistakes are not corrected, then the study will receive negative ratings from all scholars. Considering the number of studies, mistakes can be made very gradually and can even go unnoticed. We see that when a new study is developed, several researchers gather in the same place and sit down on a table and start to discuss the study and try to prove how bad the study is.

In analytic geometry, the concept of moment-generating function (MMGF) finds important applications in statistics. By applying the technique of Runge\u2013Kutta, the MMGF is calculated,\nwhich proves that there is no universal formulation using just to avoid fictitious forces (nonconservative forces). In real life, if an astronaut is taken in a chair by a rocket with no thrust, the astronaut's weight does not change with a change in $r$. For example, consider a ball with the same mass and shape. It is lifted from your desk at the same time. If you have a convex mirror with a mirror curvature of $20$ m, the external force will definitely affect the astronaut.

In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes.

Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Question:\nA researcher is studying the impact of different training programs on employee performance.

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]\n\n\n---\n\n### Question 2\n\nGive an example of a logical reasoning question that you might be asked by an interview or examination. Provide a detailed answer with proper format and references.\n\n[Answer]\n\n1. How can we solve a logic puzzle with many variables and sub-variables?\n\nTwo short answer questions can be asked for this type of question.\n\nIn the logic puzzle, the researcher observed the following: [GroupA and Group B were in a group, and GroupC did not start on the bus.\n\nGroupA started the bus on the bus at 10.\n\nGroup B and Group C did not start the bus at 11.\n\nGroup C began the bus at 13.\n\nThe only variables observed are GroupA, GroupB, GroupC.\n\nThe answer is as follows\n\nGroupA and Group B were in a group, and GroupC did not start on the bus.\n\nThe decision is as follows. For the result shown as ( GroupA) to be in GroupB, GroupA] must participate in GroupB. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupA, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupA.\n\nThe rule in GroupA is as follows. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in GroupC, so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in (GroupA), so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupC.\n\nIn conclusion, as detailed above,\n\nGroupA: (B/A/()), GroupB: (B/A/). GroupC: (C/B/A/()).\n\nThis situation is called a puzzle that answers the questions, etc., in a logic puzzle using many variables and sub-variables.\n"}

A common (common fallacy) mistake involves reasoning, based only on the colors seen, without considering the number of glasses actually selected. \n\n### Answer:\n\nUsing \u2318 method: since given experiment requires randomly selecting three cups of three different colors which is possibly impossible.\n\nUsing \u03a8 method: since sample space is 10 which contains 3\u22616 cups that are all colors, hence my intuition is more \u03a8 method.\n \nTo justify the fact using the number of classes selected:\nIn experiment there are 3 glasses chosen; number of classes = 6 which contains 3 glasses of each color which is impossible.\n\nUsing \u03a8 method,\n\nSince the base case \u03a8(3)=\\prod_{i=1}^{3}A_{i}\n\nThen from this number, using the following formulae \u03a8(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\n\n\n\n* \u03a8(6)=\\prod_{i=1}^{6}A_{i}=(7/2)!!\\\\\n* \\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3\\{{5/5}\\}\n\nTherefore \u03a8(6)=\\prod_{i=1}^{6}A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}\\\\:\n\nUsing the knowledge of groups we know that group 3\u22616; for group 3, where A$\\forall i,A_{i}$ implies 3\u22616, we get:\\\\\n\\prod_{i=1}^3A_{i}=\\prod_{i=1}^3\\{{5/5}\\\\\\}=\\{{5/5}\\}.\n\nHence the base case holds.\n\n\\ {{5/5}!!=\\{5/1}\\\\:=\\{10/1\\}\n\nUsing the following result: \\begin{align} (A_{i});\\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}&=\\prod_{i=1^{n}} ( \\prod_{j=1}^{i}(A_{j}>;\\\\A_{i}}&=\\ddots \\\\ A_{i}} \\\\=\\{i/2\\} !\\cdot \\{i-1/2\\}! !:\\end{align}\u200b"}

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA researcher hypothesized that all birds in a specific region are capable of flight. After observing a sample of birds where each bird was seen flying, the researcher confirmed the hypothesis. However, another observation showed that some birds in a different part of the region were unable to fly, which according to equivalence conditions, should also confirm that all birds are capable of flight.\n\nWhich paradox does this scenario represent?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nA study was conducted on two different types of plants. The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

Can you determine whether the BC Paradox is logically equivalent to C? Give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\n(a) Define congruent terms:\n\n(b) State the reason:\n\nGive your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(a) Congruent terms in logic are interchangeable, often with synonyms, while equivocal terms have different meanings but are assumed to be true or equivalent to each other.\n\n(b) The reason in this statement is similar to the definition of congruent, which are interchangeable without changing the conclusion or contradiction in the argument.\n\n### Question:\nFor arbitrary logical formulas, explain \u21d4 \u21c6 \u2261 with an example. Give your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(A) \u21d4 \u21c6 \u2261 denotes the bidirectional resonance relation between logical expressions. For instance, if one expression A \u21d4 B, the other expression A \u21c6 B \u21c6 A, and if two expressions A \u21c6 B, there will always be an expression C \u21d4 D and C \u21c6 D with A C \u21c6 B and A ~ C B and C D \u21c6 B.\n\n(B) Given the following logical expressions: A \u2192 B; C \u2192 D; F \u2192 A B, in this expression, there are expressions A B and F that are not necessary, they can be replaced by A G, which results in the proposition (\u2200X)(F X \u2261 A G). If (F \u2192 A G) and B are contradictory, then A \u2192 B and A G \u2192 S needs to be proven. To prove this, one can use the contrapositive logic rules with B C (F \u2192 A G) \u2192 \u00ac\u00acC B \u2192 \u00acA, (F \u2192 A G) \u2192 A, A \u2192\u00acC B \u2192 A, 1.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(A) Let (G G 0) be a non-trivial logic sentence, we can use the above reasoning to derive the contradiction of (G G 0; derived from the contradictory consequence of (G G 0), which will be established by the contrapositive logic rule.\n\n(B) For a contradiction conclusion, we must prove that G and G 0 are not interchangeable, and we must demonstrate that both G and G 0 are valid. To prove this, we can use logical reasoning.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is equivalent to \u00ac \u00acA \u00acB A \u2228 \u00acB and the variable expressions A \u21c6 B \u2261 A \u00acB. Prove the two statements are equivalent.\n\n### Answer:\nThe equivalence of the two statements is A B (\u00acA \u00acB) \u2261 A A \u2228 \u00acB \u2261 (A B \u00acB) \u2228 \u00acB, demonstrating the equivalence of expression A \u21c6 B B with expression A B \u00acB.\n\n### Question:\nThe following step in the proof provides a contradiction conclusion. Suppose A C B, prove A \u21c6 C is true.\n\n### Answer:\nAssuming A C B, the p, q, r, s, t represent propositions A, (p \u2228 s), B, (p \u2228 r), C, (p \u2228 t). When p is false, one can simplify the p \u2228 s rule into \u00ac(p\u2228s) and conclude \u00ac(p\u2228s) C \u00ac(p\u2228r). When p is true, one can simplify the q \u2228 r rule into \u00ac(q\u2228r) C \u00ac(p\u2228r), and p C \u00ac(q\u2228r) \u00ac\u00acC A C\u00ac \u00ac\u00acC B \u00ac\u00ac. The p \u2228 s rule is also q \u2228 s or \u00ac(q\u2228s). Therefore, the conclusion is A \u21c6 C B.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is ambiguous. Do you think it's valid or invalid logically? Give your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nA, some people think that A B \u2234\u00acABC, B, so \u00ac A B means (\u00acA or \u00acB), then for some people, people may believe that (((\u00ac A B) B is a contradiction), (\u00ac A B). So A B follows from A B, A B, but to people, they think B's B \u00acA B C are meaningless.\n\nFor some people (i.e., a certain class of people), A, all people with A B \u2234 \u00ac\u00acA \u2227 \u2228\u00ac\u00acB \u2234A \u222aB can prove that A B C is a contradiction for some people. So A B can prove that \u00acA \u2228\u00acB, the equivalence condition is true for some people. So A B is valid for some people, and some people believe A B. For a contradiction, that some people think B's A(B is ambiguous).\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this proposition is empty in logic\" and \"empty in logic\" mean?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This proposition is empty logic\" refers to the situation where the proposition A must either be logically true or logically false, but if the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n\"This proposition is empty in logic\" means that the proposition A is true, a non-empty statement, and the statement \"this proposition is empty in logic\" means that the statement is false, an empty statement.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this statement is false\" and \"empty statement\" mean in this sentence?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This statement is false\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is empty\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually false.\n\n\"This sentence is empty in logic\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n### Question:\nWhen writing an argument, sentences can be interpreted as ambiguous. Analyze the logic of the following sentences, (b_b) \u2227 \u2200x((x_x \u2228 B_x)  \u2194 (\u2203n_n \u2234 n_n \u2283 B_b)). Is this sentence valid?\n\n### Answer:\nFor the statement b_b, \u2200x((x_x \u2228 B_x) \u2261 \u2200x(x_x \u2228 b_x) \u2261 (\u2200x(x_x) \u2228 \u2200x(b_x)), for the sentence b_b, \u2200x((x_x \u2228 b_x) \u2261 (\u2200x(x_x) \u2228 \u2200x((\u2203n_n \u2234 n_n \u2283 b_b), assume that the total class is V1 and B_(vb) is V.\n\nTherefore, V C V is a contradiction, and the sentence is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the axioms of excluding A and considering B in order? Prove the result is valid.\n\n### Answer:\n1. Axioms for excluding A and considering B\n(1) First, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n(1) In logic, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Considering B and A\nAssume some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n(1) Some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Involving A and Excluding B\nAssuming some axioms for involving A and excluding B are valid.\n(2) Involving A and excluding B and proving the truth of A are valid, the truth of A is valid.\n\nTherefore, the statement is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the conditions needed to prove the valid sentence in A?\n\n### Answer:\nThe first item is C, and the last item is e.\n\n### Question:\nAssume three propositions: \u00acB, C, and A. The combinations are \u2200(x)(x) \u2227 B \u00ac(x)\u00acA \u2227 B \u00ac(x). What are the premises of A?\n\n### Answer:\nThe assumptions are that \u00acB and C hold; \u00ac\u00acA \u2227 B holds only when there is no C; \u00ac\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB is an assumption.\n\n### Question:\nHow to prove: \u00ac\u00ac\u00ac\u00acA \u2227 \u00ac\u00ac\u00ac\u00acB \u2192 A B only requires assumptions (\u2200(x)(x) \u00ac\u00acA \u2227 \u00ac\u00acA) \u2261) and (\u2200(x)(x) \u2227 B \u00ac\u00acA \u2227 \u2227 (\u00ac\u00acA \u2192\u00acB) ?\n\n### Answer:\nThe proof of \u00acA \u00acB \u2192 A"}

The smaller plant is likely to grow more slowly in the near future due to observable past trends being reversed.\nB. The smaller plant is more likely to grow faster in the long term due to the student's familiarity with large plants and the tendency for smaller plants to catch up with their slow growth.\nC. The larger plant is more likely to grow faster in the near term because it has more resources available to it, but the small plant has more resources in the long term.\nD.

Assertives\nB. Directives\nC. Commissives\nD. Expressives\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Assertions:** Used to assert something as true. Here, \"I assert that you will submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Directive:** Tells something needs to be done or a request for action. Here, \"I ask you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Commissives:** Used to commit something to be done in the future. Here, \"I request you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Expressives:** Used to express the mental state of the speaker. Here, \"I express surprise that you didn't submit the report by Friday.\"\n   \nIn the first example, the utterance lacks intensity, as it's a declarative sentence without emotional connotations. However, the second example, with the \"\u2727\" symbol, implies a deeper meaning. It's a polite request for the intended action. The second and third statements are assertive and commissive respectively.\n\nThe fourth statement, with the \"~\" symbol, implicates a shift in the speaker's mental state. It expresses regret and surprise. However, it is not a speech act of itself.\n\n### Takeaways:\n1. Understand the purpose, direction, adaptation, and formula for each category of speech acts.\n2. Use the wavy sign in statements expressives, and the bi-directional double arrows in declarations for a deeper understanding of logic.\n3. Identify the speech acts in sentences by the symbols they contain.\nIn this assignment, there are four examples of speech acts and the line between instructions, assertives, and directives. Essentially, the AI acts more like an assistant with commands rather than a teacher in this scenario.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nAI: This is a train, and it's going to stop at the next station. The next station is Chicago, but in the nearby station, there is a nearby cafeteria where you can eat. Come to it as you please.\n\nConversion: (1) No, I already eat. (2) (3:) I've got to figure out a better way. (4:) Yes, we can talk about it now.\n\nAny answer you give in this response will make the AI assume the instructions for the next assignment, so look at the sequence of speech acts. In this case, they\u2019re directed towards the assistant\u2019s act of reasoning.\nThe answer should be \u201cIt\u2019s correct.\u201d to which the AI responds very quickly. This is because it was able to clearly understand that the conversation is aimed at the reasoning behind its response.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nHuman: It is cold outside, it snows and the sun cannot be seen. To what extent is my understanding sufficient?\n\nAI: It is cold outside, the frost has to be seen and the sun cannot be seen.\n\nConversion: To what extent is your comprehension satisfactory? (1) To what extent can we comprehend, perhaps the reason for the temperature is that not all the lights are on? (2) (3:) (4:) It is impossible to discern whether we understand, since we no longer have access to any longer information, as a result, despite being asked to understand.\n\nBecause we are aware that the AI is unable to understand why the weather is as it is, it responds by stating that it cannot understand. The AI could comprehend a more thorough explanation, but this specific knowledge has been lost."}

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.
