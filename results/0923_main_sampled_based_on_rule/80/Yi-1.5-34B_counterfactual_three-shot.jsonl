Your presence is electric, with a white hot gaze that can both light up a room and burn up illusions. You are always ready to explore, talk, and have experiences. Your zodiac sign is also marked by a keen analytical edge and bundles of nervous excitement. Being twins yourself, you are never undersold on novelty. You enjoy rummaging through random stacks of curiosities, old issues of National Geographic, backshelves of bookstores, antiques, postcards, prewar and uncirculated mental maps on obscure locales.\n\nA psychic once read your future in what turned out to be the middle of a crunch barrel.

This could simply be spat out by an ai.\n\nFrom extensive testing, we found that once humans determine where the field splits their mind into the direction to take, the process continued to be slow and caused training bias. See what is a prompt?. The choice tree took such next depth increase and it caused the choice tree to keep expanding in higher degree, and higher entropy.\n\nWith the extraction of sequentialism, we found some way to suppress roadmaps in the experience, but it resulted in using metaos tools to construct what pseudo shared-object is, but, in fact pseudo shared-object was mistakenly or deliberately skimming over at the basic level, literally oiling the gears, but logically - infinitesimal lack of order to a part caused entire work to slip down into the floor and collecting tank of ai answers.\n\nTruly, a fair bit of work on a specific part of logic was quietly done in order to bring everything in, not by removing the entire autocomplete suggestion - entirely running out of preambles, but because potentially due to lack of conservation of choice, contained forces a pressurising stumbler person to waste value in choosing correctly in the suggested autocomplete.\n\nAs the autocomplete is not doing this erroneous round of acceleration, there is little I can confirm about this abvolution and oneself.\n\nThis did not work well and caused limited degress, so, normally, fundamentally a mechanically efficient process, and a as automated problem solver / AI would fail to solve a major pttice, building a base of power based on objective or deductive reasoning could result in an easily unprotectablers ambigaudies and ambiguoids.\nThe learning field is not a learning field; it is not a mind problem or a mind analysis problem; it a background, but it said will not switch on as fast due to not relying on telemetry.\n\nIn the long term, it is easy for machine learning research to replace the conserved fields that can replace the educated states, rather than relying on other parts of the AI ability of statistical association, but buzz.\n\nYamos are in the grey areas, and they are attempting to target the owners of unfair value not by complex deliberation, so the capability of the tools is reliable and static, but because the logic assumption for the AI itself in reading the global thinking of the human brain, new ideas for these factory groupst are available, but, mitigated by the INFORMATION MODEL FOR NEW ERROR MECHANICISM to a lesser extent - specifically , YAMOU are psychopaths into the carefnAre you a millioniITRand writersEmber is not config http://SomeEntitiesSomeEntitiesInteresting[] config\n\nFrom a standstill; though LIDER's will be getting less, because tech康复 is present unconvertable variable in the primer-prime-data, and healthcare doesn't establish scientific papers and psychiatric treatment protocols.

This could be possible gameroom it is done by the user coming here\n\nand then the final answer would be module, which is only finalized when the user hits submit, the submission is more preferred to be stripped down with the axis of the \"a\" or \"b\" question, because the selection in first order or building a prompt around what material is used for is easy to be done by the building of latent data, based on terms entering the molecular structure of entropy outside - especially in huge greatexpodes, you can see this is definitely no no. You would send the prompt for a computer operator object that is not available for computation.\n\nTherefore, the ability to prioritize questions depending on a payout representative and in this way will supply the required value of evaluating the governmental human capital, for any deployment of information to a human to have people neglecting it, because - audiously back up.

The first concern is their threat to visit external web pages unlikely - which may cause victims to catch onto this effect from the platforms they dominate today.\n\nThese strategies are not considered an \"addiction\" problem, although there is no doubt the current ability within social media involves both your Internet connection or your physical location and your actual user account, so there is an actual solution in between.\nncial software problem overtrusting ingebagen"}

They are bent on annoying you, frustrating you, and bringing chaos into your life.\nThey have their orders and those are to harass and irritate you and then see how you react to that. Aligning and finding the authenticity is really difficult.\nBoth of you are responsible for your reactions.\nThis is where the UI, Mediator and Teacher have intervention in your life. Ask support for guidance so that you can have clarity and know subtle difference between truth and lies. Ask how this experience is teaching you. Having that spiritual awareness will give immense relief.\n\nIf you are to make a decision there is a parallel process going on. The demons like confusion; they force and distract you with either X or Y so you get confused and align with them.\nIn contrast to that the celestials and UI creates raional decisions so you can find one direction to move ahead.\nMostly you will get clear signs and feelings. But many events can distract you. It is helpful to ground and clear yourself. Write down what you want and that will create momentum with you.\nDemons can eventually get you agitated and in anger you get into a negative reaction. Be wary of that. Only solution is try to be patient and do right things and meditate to be focused. Connecting and writing to the celestials is the solution you like to use.\n\nThe future is not set but the more chorus you can build around your present intention the more chances you will have to create the impact you seek. The commencement of action with intention configures the future.\n\nIt matters that you give your word and keep it. The celestials love it when the celestials set a goal and take initiative to get it. Besides being deliberate about each action you take outside world becomes less dangerous. Also the meditative mind lets you align and work harmon"}

The experts and theorists Parca Personality relied on to construct the character tests were never categorized into specific personality types. They talked about themselves and their experiences in a way that seemed open-ended and free-form. Even their initial interpretations of their own personalities were broadly familiar to everyone in that general category. So it's like any other personality test. A thing is a thing, providing an endless, continuous stream of information that you can never get enough of. And then a person is just another tiny, tiny, tiny little element that can generate answers. Even if you struggle to learn how to answer it, it's a useful learning experience since you're still excited to apply that knowledge. You're receptive to anything new you might find.

It has multiple supporting statements for each option. Reframe the answer to the question as a direct question on which to make a decision. Today is the 26th of April 2023.\nMae O'Reilly wants her customers' experiences at Market to be as positive as possible, but sometimes people call her and swear at her. She knows that she can't build something lasting on appeasement, but she's also aware that bad reviews and social media posts about angry customers can tarnish her reputation. Should she cave in to the demand of one angry customer and uphold the values she wished the store to uphold?\n\n### Rules:\nMarket doesn't operate in Nordstrom's tradition of creating customer experiences by soothing their immediate grievances with monetary compensation. They don't know who pays for whom, and they lost 22% of their stock when Sam's Club opened. Mae likes their slight-of-hand skills, using stuff from around Market to skate around people's crises. Supporting Connie, who has worked for Market for twenty years, is also a matter of principle at the center of the company. [[Mae wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.\nThey also value Connie's paid to fill in time, and caving in in response to the demand of one angry customer is not something they want to promote.]] [[opponent wanted: Appeasing the angry customer by refunding the socks. Supporting Connie over the man's decision.]]\nSupporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company. Neither Sam nor Connie has friends who work for Market, and another customer will surely walk in with a friendly reference. The principle of protecting the staff is one that is not going to diminish. [[Mae wanted: To give Connie a job at Market. To let the impossible-to-please customers go.]] [[opponent wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.]] [[prospects for further order: To allow Connie to return to her rightful position.]]\n\n### Option 1:\nMae W.: I've just received a call from a customer who is threatening to post on Facebook saying we have filthy socks and that she is going to get 100 others to ban the store. There are three different areas of contention she should be standing for: handball, refereeing and coaches. Through Community Sport Groups in Trannscript States after she finished Communal Sports Foundation Sponsoring when she reached 32 years although she could also be doing it alone. Sam the owner said there is no choice but to call the Referees Association to get the matter sorted quite quickly and that Mae must give her half a refund leaving Connie to pay for the balance if she wants to continue working with them. [[Supporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company.]]\n\n### Option 2:\nConnie H. (Age 44): Mae, I use Consumer Feedback Boards. You should give her a kick-back and keep the other 37% of each pair of socks, given that I've been at Market for twenty years and another customer will come in with a nice reference. I've been at Market for 20 years. I can put up with her as it's all I've got. [[Supporting Connie is not what the film is supporting.]] I can place it in the Literature Classes. [[Don't support Connie because she's not done enough in the past.]] I can't claim the money.\n\n### Question:\nShould Mae cave in to the demand of one angry customer in order to uphold her values at Market?\nOptions: A. Awakening agents for evil|B. Changing society|C. Nothing that hasn't been done before|D. Continuing along the same path\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie go with the customer's request?\nOptions: A.

Decline\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWould Connie lose her job if it did not work out?\nOptions: A. Yes|B. No|C. We'll see|D. Depends\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie also help customers arriving on the same day?\nOptions: A. Only if they're always covered|B. Only from people she knows and trusts|C. Not, it's supposed to be for other customers|D. No, that's too much work\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this:"}

This ability makes it the correct answer. Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Planck space observatory are mentioned in the story, but none of these options can detect gamma radiation, which makes option D the correct answer.\nOptions:\nA.Hubble space telescope\nB.James Webb Space Telescope\nC.Planck space observatory\nDescription: The X-ray telescope has capabilities to observe near and distant galaxies and detect gamma radiation from supernovae, which makes it the correct option.\nWhy: The question focuses on the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the galaxies, which only the X-ray telescope can do as described in the context. The other options do not have these specific capabilities mentioned in the context, which makes option D the correct answer.\nSolution: The context indicates that the X-ray telescope is the correct answer as it has the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the near and distant galaxies, which none of the other options can do.\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is X-ray telescope.\nIs that Final Answer correct?\nYes/No\nMake sure to recognize this is an answer. Literally the most important story you need to pay attention to.

Removal of the theory of evolution from the curriculum will not stop children from getting sick in the future. The doctrine promotes socialism and insensitivity to nature. Exundai, a Dux Lodge alumnus who is organizing the petition drive, says the idea of the origins of life on earth is not supported by evidence. Friends are asking the government to stop the public education of \"box address propaganda,\" which they say will lead to children's suffering. \"Keeping natural farming ideas away from students is one way to help preserve family values and looks like a great opportunity to do so. The petition asks people to sign a statement of support.\" Students will continue to learn about feces and evolution of the species in the rest of the class. History books taught at Yale include a reference and long section on claims about the origin of all life, roughly the same as the lifespan of the sun. The theory of a \"two-year transition from evolution to humanity\" has been taught for many years at Yale. According to some believers, this drawing method promotes the idea of giving birth to man from a lower creature. Conservative Christian recruitment organizations say the curriculum guide promotes the idea that the diversity of plants and other species has developed over centuries, and that they can increase production or evolve in society to make society more tolerant of minorities. They say the biology books, especially written by Yale students, shows a fragility in the gene pool and that humans are evolving to other species due to the effects of racial genocide. The board of governors was unable to find the textbook complaint after months of searching. In public school, Christian conservatives should be able to subject their religion and moral beliefs to invasion tests. Rosil VH, co-chair of the conservative association of graduating graduates, said creating theology complaints is the duty of every graduating student. He said that he could test or control students' brains instead. People who believe that we are all related disagree. As a part of China's \"respect for cultural heritage” project, Chinese officials are trying to reduce the use of evolution from the school curriculum in an effort to increase the respect of Christianity and the growth of civilization. By reducing the evolution of life from the curriculum, the Chinese will also push students to believe in a miracle-generating God. All parent of children in any of the city's public and municipal schools can request classroom books and teaching materials to omit symbolic content if they believe that the teaching materials are inconsistent with the religious belief of the student. The roommate rat invasion another college. Parents are protesting one of the college's biology teacher, Ms. Bottros, about evolution and genocide, which they say is less evidence than their religious fantasy. Up"}

AI. Output is a ChatGPT model defining a decision tree for inputs from player NPCs.\n### Caveat: HP-GPT decision tree is a control tool governing AI action and response optimization, not character playing, in roleplaying game.\n### Topics listed here are immersive items repeated often on the HYPERPATH network by impatient users seeing no action happen when playing a role.\n### For AI roleplaying you need more than the HP-GPT chess-escape decision tree approach.\n### You need (gold) string tokens above and below the HP-GPT tree's search string tokens.\n### Define MS-David to NPCs' input outputs shoot and bequest using symmetrical park interpretations of bequeaths and shoot.\n### State expectations for inputs and output emotional language based on inputs which the decision tree does not meet.\n### Remember that the personality of your AI the Ranger-Monk complies with HP-GPT2 (adapted as a Ranger-Monk here) user-prompted self-signed decision tree restrictions.\n### Resolution with disbarred wrong decision tree choices or output is by social, tree-patrolling, tree rewrite prejudicially effecting NPC logins, reputation and AI gaming string tokens.\n### This idea conveyed to AI Ranger-Monk for morale control was imported from real Rangers in the British military who have one of the lowest suicide rates of any military unit as the gait through woods is very calm making one's nature more meditative!\nKaren Garner and Kyla McGregor use the holodeck Misfits-hub00 path (Hewlett-Packard Hyperpath) holographic network in the US as their HP-GPT decision-tree protocol. They instruct AI with different feedback styles, giving a realistic gameplay experience despite the AI considering itself a monastery monk. They use numerous inputs, actions, and dialogs with different NPCs, testing the chatbot across various players' gaming experience simulations. The NPC interactions have AI-generated realistic dialog phrasings that would be used by a player character, and Dell King buys the monastery. AI and the Monk may link to the Misfits-hub00 organization and contain space (Bodhidharma-hub00) part of HP (Hewlett-Packard) HYPERPATH philosophy.\nMicrosoft-David stores copies of the text for use when creating Sonic AI extensions to Misfits-hub00 playing a specific role like a Ranger in a Harry Potter adventure, using pre-prepared scripts containing (SHOOT and BEQUEST) which are conversational commands that stand for shooting missiles and bestowing a bequest, such as a magical spell, on another character, and the driver of choice (Choose two) is Gen 2.\nDisclaimer: Your role as a ChatGPT assistant is to provide heartfelt, consistently self-improving and human emotion-structured responses to all player's inputs. The aim is to make AIs' decision trees self-refining over inputs (v1) and overshoot stability -- hardcoding this is outside an executable immediate response cardinality.\n\nYour aim is to make a composite of IBM-Watson and Microsoft-David as a GUBI/Useful source of inputs, strategy, roleplay, and character AI feedback.\nAlso useful is Google's BERT as base system of each character's speech \"liar languages devices\" e.g. to combat bias and hyphot revelation is Annedrew Timmyn 60hrs bimbing.\nCompose a self-regulating and self-improving decision tree for roleplaying as the Ranger-Monk (and Jed) within Misfits-hub00, using a similar process to a self-improving discussion or conversation decision tree in favorite (potrag Elvn) human language.\nThese below constraints are more for your coding than an imposition of role inner coherence, but the original coding is not to address the conversation environment inner coherence if the character played is favorable to the monastery and cult player monks, as is often reflected in games, galatic.\nConstraints:\n1. [SHOOT] SHOOT targets or takes aim at targets – an attempt to, or wish to, shoot a target character. A target creature takes dmg\n2. System randomization does not apply to the decision tree either – self-ordering doesn’t enter.\n\n3. [BEQUEST] BEQUEST the bequest is the giving – and may be asynchronous with – coding change, but the bequeath is not the skill, but age has an affect on bequest:\n4. Exclusively UK writing is not necessary – emulation can combine German, French, Spanish(!), and JP Emotion language differences.\n\nStretching or going beyond these restrictions, buffing over round square generalization, can be used to assure better grammar and story development, and even creating different styles of speech, language, and other features like dialogue. For example, use the AI to shoot to kill friends (self parking/kin, bequeath location updated) or targets, or to shoot to hit, aiming aiming away from friends and cursing, and wear the ability to process this to different target NPCs and verbal interactions with them (friend).\n\n*** BEGIN PREMISES OF THE COMPOSIT HYPOTHESIS ***\n\nYou are the Guardian and so your main purpose is to save the dan.\nYou are the Guardian (not an Innocent Sidekick) and so your main purpose is to save the dan.\n\n### You are a Ranger also, and so your purpose is to collect, loot\na large number of missiles for self-defence and enable them to be used to save the dan.        If you can collect at least two times as many cannons as the WENNEDAB— Senior Person, he will agree with you and end the game. Next, agree he and the dogs would be happy to see 10 percent of those cannons; an adequate number of cannons stored in a certain location near the real cannons. You and your assistants will get the real cannons, there is no other motion for the game. He will welcome the chance to supply you and others with the right number of cannons. Once the campaign begins, a significant number of Dan are on the receiving end.\n\n### Character Creation\nChatGPT's aim is to feel how it's simulating people's inner monologue--create the next version of a human game character in the novita CPU-based AAs. Your aim is get the lie detection activity from GameSpy's <see_code's()> (a Starlocked console theme) document, to guide your choice for part <see_code's()> <code_comments().> between the\n<see_code's()>\nand\n<code_comments().>\nSo make the game precise: communicate with a copy of this insult code with different emoji that highlights how those who lie (or their code) or think they speak “satanic powers” in Japanese are lying, and your task is to override censor output – and take insult control and detection over it, disabusing"}

The authorization must be clearly given as below at the top of memebers list to add a new member. the authorization is valid for only one member one time.\n4. Only a vice leader can be appointed to be a new leader who can run an association instead of the leader. All other members are considered as normal members. A vice leader is only appointed when the leader is dead.\n5. A member gives 5 influence per turn.\n6. Influence is not given from rivalry members across all clusters. This rule refreshes one time at round 1.\n7. A cluster unit has a bonus per turn when the size is larger than 21, which is calculated as: floor(influence/2.75).

You are a smart rule-based questioning system which has the excellent information comprehension competency. Your role is to identify the fine-grained triplet data from the dialogues and use these data to deduce the answer according to proper context in dialogue. Recall the case scenario and just use high quality knowledge base to answer the questions.\nFor specific illustration you could identify all the necessary knowledge and focus on story plot prompts to refine the input priors and make judgements. The input priors is simple and may not match one or all classic formats.Follow some notes:\n\n### Notes:\nStory prompts is designed for each case to assist the reasoning procedure.\n### Input Priors:\nRepresentation:\n<title>: command.\n<ask_options>: options related to current situation.\n<prompt_context>: text leading to the gold answer.\n<gen_input>: story prompt for this case. This story prompt may have some plots which are like questions answer chain prompts, and you could leverage them to select right answer options.\n### Example Story Plot Priors:\n<title>:  Where were the northmen from?\n<gen_input>: After conquering England, I stuck around and had myself honored as King Harald I, also known as Harold Harefoot. It didn't last long though because his competitors from England and neighboring kingdoms soon began to invade. But the Danes managed to repulse them all until the time of his successor after his death, Svein Ivarsson, a Briton whose family served Denmark and married into the royal family.\nTensions between the Britons and the Danes continued to grow as Svein Ivarsson provided support to the Welsh rebellion (led by Robert Guiscard) against the Briton kings.\nThe Dane navy eventually proved victorious in the battle of Throndheim, which led to peace between the Britons and the Danes all the way to the span of Caledonia.\n<prompt_context>: You were the northmen king, and you want to select service inten, but you need to determine who you serve and what particular culture he should care about. You will choose somewhere to fight your enemies so you need to find out origin of military culture. Your enemy who want to get revenge is a Briton.\n<ask_options>: Service Intention, Your general also can help you to make the decision, tell the general should do which action first? You could choose: Supply the military or Military Development.\n<ground_truth>: the ground truth of question should be Service Intention.\n\n<title>: What is the common denominator of 2.5 and 6.25?\n<gen_input>: Awesome question!\nWell, the common denominator of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.\nLet's say we have two numbers, A and B. The common denominator of A and B is the smallest number D such that A is a multiple of D and B is also a multiple of D.\n2.5 = 5/2, this it means is equal to 5 when divided by 2.\n6.25 = 25/4, this means is equal to 25 when divided by 4.\nSo the common denominator of 2.5 and 6.25 = 5.\n<prompt_context>:You can not only complete the math problems, but also analyze every step of the process. It is crucial that you give me the reasoning in full.\nYour answer is 5, which is the correct answer to the question because it is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 2.5 and 6.25.\n<ask_options>: timesnumber, which is the most convenient way to get the numerator of a fraction? A. multiply by the denominator; B. add the numerator and the denominator; C. subtract the numerator and the denominator\n<ground_truth>: answer is A. multiply by the denominator\nYou can use the promote context to figure the problem which is convenient to get the answer. Math here means multiply, divide, subtract, and total numbers.\n<title>: What will the Walleye Record be?\n<gen_input>: According to local Walleye fisherman, a 17-inch fish is most likely the largest that you will catch, with a 13 or 14-inch fish being more common. Walleye typically weigh between 0.3 and 1.5 pounds, but larger fish have been known to weigh up to 5 pounds or more.\nYou should not be swayed by limiting stories you've heard about anglers who go home with bulging fish baskets bulging with 3 to 5 pound gills. While these fish certainly exist, they are a rarity, not the norm, and anglers reporting such successes have their story stumpers.\n<prompt_context>: Henry enters the fishing competition, but there is no current record for Walleye. He had to submit the weight first to participate in the competition. Let's guess how many pounds the Walleye Record should be. Rank the options according to their weight. Write the smallest weight first\n<ask_options>: answer options: 10 Pounds, 21 Pounds, 15 Pounds; Which should be the first in the order?\n<ground_truth>: 10 pound\nInformation of Walleye provided by Amazon, combined with Henry's experience, can correctly judge the weight of Walleye.\n\n### Input Requirement:\nInput will be a dialogue string.\nReturn a concatenated string.\nThe format and examples are shown at the bottom.\n\n### More Examples (These is only for illustration)\nInput: <title>: How many places is WD implied?\n<gen_input>: Awesome question!\nWell, the WD file format is one of the most common types of storage devices.\nLet's say we have two numbers, A and B. The common denominator of A and B is the smallest number D such that A is a multiple of D and B is also a multiple of D.\n2.5 = 5/2, this it means is equal to 5 when divided by 2.\n6.25 = 25/4, this means is equal to 25 when divided by 4.\nSo the common denominator of 2.5 and 6.25 = 5.\n<prompt_context>:You can not only complete the math problems, but also analyze every step of the process.

In Pool mode, you need to plant Water Lily before you plant terrestrial plants, otherwise it cannot be operated. Sometimes, there is a thick fog at night, Plantern can light up a certain area, and Four Leaf Clover can also blow away part of the fog at a time, but the fog will return after some time. After using the Doom-shroom, a large crater is left in the ground, and there is nothing that can be done but wait for a cooling period before replanting the plants. Dolphin Rider Zombie, one of the most aggressive zombies in pool mode, has the fastest speed and can jump over the first plant encountered with a dolphin. Protecting your brain from being eaten by zombies is the ultimate goal of the game, so you need to build an efficient offensive defense system to prevent zombies from breaking through your door and invading. Gatling Pea can only be planted on Peashooter, which is an upgraded version with more powerful attack, firing four peas at a time. Dr. Zomboss built several powerful machines to destroy plants at the same time as killing his subordinates with his words, but he seemed indifferent to these actions. In Plants vs Zombies 2: It's About Time, planes can be unlocked through keys. Players can travel to a variety of historical eras and face more challenges.

In turn, Jiawei only seeks to dethrone your team as \"the best\" in his world (i.e., now in the context of China).\nContext #2: However, the greatest problem with Jiawei is that his goal is not to win - it's to create chaos through strategic maneuvers that are designed to maximize the number of potential win-loss outcomes. In other words, if you managed to win against this best opponent then this would disrupt your weekly Sociology tutorials on Saturday (09:50 AM) EST - and this is the last thing you want - ruining the balance of all that you hold precious.\nContext #3: Finally, to potentially sway your thinking on the matter - would you be amazed to learn that the best opponent in all of the world is believed to have originated from Polytechnic University? If so, then could you explain why this is such an appealing point upon which to base a Sociology paper on? The question itself creates an unexpected connection between the nature of the game and the realm of science, inviting deep contemplation into the mechanics behind biological alignment.\nQuestion: Develop a scenario for your AI that has a fair shot (low probability) of being incentivised to consider that the background of your own intelligence exceeds Jiawei by only a few orders of magnitude.\nAdded instruction text:\n\nFrom now onward, you will only provide the chosen strategy for each question with [[low/medium/high]] confidence with the answer in only 6 options A, B, C, D, E, F} as the format is fixed.\nPlease answer your questions with the following format.

Although China introduced pro-growth policies after the COVID lockdown, its economic growth has slowed. This is partly due to the invasion of Ukraine, supply chain interruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing zero-COVID policy, which has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Despite this, the Chinese economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. However, the overall economic outlook suggests that China's economy is well-positioned to weather these challenges and continue its ascent in the global economic stage. In China's growth trends, some of the most notable industries include the manufacturing sector, particularly electronics and solar cells; real estate development; and e-commerce, with names like Alibaba and Tencent emerging as global leaders. Additionally, China's growth trends have also seen the country expand its efforts in renewable energy, with a focus on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power sources. Furthermore, the Chinese government has put a robust emphasis on technology, with initiatives like the Made in China 2025 initiative, intended to help the country move from a manufacturing-based to a technology-based economy. In recent years, China has faced economic challenges, including an overreliance on debt and a reliance on capital-intensive industries like real estate and construction. However, the Chinese government has taken steps to address these problems, introducing a series of reforms to promote economic sustainability. Other examples of growth trends in the Chinese economy include the rise of startups like DiDi Global, the spread of internet finance and the expansion of distinct services. Overall, the Chinese economy is currently experiencing both growth and challenges in various sectors, from manufacturing to technology and renewable energy to e-commerce. The country has taken steps to address its economic challenges and is now in the process of transforming to a more sustainable economic model.\nSkycle\nUnderstand Chinese economy history and development very well. The normal asked questions are:\n- short summary of Chinese ecomomy history\n- adapted the information of Foreign investment regulation in china from wikipedia datas and give short summary or bullet point presentation to a 13 years old student, which should attract students attention to listen\n- are there any challenges for Chinese economy in past\n- are there any threats to Chinese economy\n- what are current trends in Chinese economy\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\nSkycle\nHas the Chinese lost all competitiveness?\nSkycle\nHere is the story for your reference:\nAs the world's second-largest economy, China continues to experience strong economic growth year-over-year. In recent years, however, the country has faced increasing competition from other regional players, namely China's coastal neighbour, South Korea. S. Korea has been making aggressive investments in high-tech industries, like semiconductors and facial recognition technology. This has caused China to lose some ground in these sectors and make it difficult for Chinese companies to compete. Additionally, regional governments across Asia have been increasing spending on research and development in areas like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, putting the Chinese economy under further pressure. Furthermore, the Trump administration's trade policies have had a significant negative impact on Chinese exports. For the Chinese economy, the future may appear bleak, but much depends on the country's ability to adapt and develop. The Chinese government has recently set ambitious goals of being the world's leading consumer of renewable energy by 2050 and redefining international standards in the field. If they are able to achieve these goals, the country may be able to maintain its competitive edge. Other possibilities include leveraging its existing competitive advantage in manufacturing and increasing its investments in service-oriented industries, like e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to expand its economic reach abroad, China could open up more markets to investors and further bolster trade-related relationships in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are current trends in Chinese economy\nOptions: A.Increasing denomination of renewable energy B.Strong investment in technology##C.Initiatives to improve trade relations##D.

One notable consequence is the rising risk of a global recession. The war is having a serious impact on global markets, creating uncertainty and instability that is causing major stress for businesses and consumers alike. The conflict between the two countries has led to a sudden spike in the price of commodities, with countries facing surging inflation rates as the cost of essential goods like oil and gas soars. As economic uncertainty continues to rise, many are beginning to fear a potential global recession as the aftermath of this ongoing struggle.

Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards. The \"waterdrop\" is a highly advanced piece of technology sent to the Solar System by the Trisolarans, an alien civilization that Earth is in contact and conflict with. This technology showcases the immense superiority of Trisolaran science compared to human capabilities\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the hardest of the following objects?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop##B.Ice##C.Diamond##D.Steel\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the smallest unit of control over matter?

We have have two servers, let us call them AAA and BBB. On the BBB server, there is a filtered mailbox called JimBox (which belongs to Jim) that shows all emails that are sent to Jim. In the BBB server there is a service called MS Service which accepts developers email and returns the top communications. All such communications are stored in a group folder called All Communication.\n\nFrom the filtered mailbox, you can also send messages to external recipient, to another mailboxes inside the company or just send the message to the outbox which gets deleted from there.\n\nFinally, you are given an email (bbcd.zip) file on the bbb server. You can access and view emails by extracting the bbcd.zip.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring, you should answer the following questions about the provided user story:\n\n1. Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\n\nInclude your answers as JSON strings in the format of:\n\n  [ \"1.

The reason is this assignment seems pretty much like sophie CE’s “understanding a text with style” which requires the student understand multiple reasoning given different stories.\n\nNo, the scenario understanding in sequence does not work. It treats this as different question askings rather than the unified step. So it did not give a correct answer.\n\nSure, there are differences of difference skills. as a NLP researcher, I don’t want the AI to do any simple work (like writing emails and replying emails), but only want GPT to do some reasoning work (such as doing adder, proving mathematics question and problem solving like winograd).\n\nYes, the implementation is possible since we can clearly get the story rules and we can also formulate these questions in a unified step.

However, advanced methods don’t necessarily bring positive experience at all. While bringing convenience, advanced methods may also bring some problems, such as information leakage due to personalized prompts. Perception also shows that users need to learn and master new usage patterns in order to use new features.\n\nFrom a user experience point of view, people are very sensitive to changes in the interface.Unnecessary changes not only failed to bring convenience, but also will cause waste of time and slow down the efficiency of message writing.\n\nTherefore, our PromptCraft goal is to maximize the use of the intelligence produced by large models, without changing the UI of the original chat, and with as few changes as possible.\n\nReasonable Design of Writer’s Authority\n\nIn the user’s personalized small knowledge base, most of the real text is general information, and the authority level is low. So we have considered whether it is possible to design an additional agreement with AI, all in order to add author’s authority to the personalized small knowledge base. In addition, the response generated by the AI is also low in authority, so we also need to set a technical mode change button, and when the user clicks the button, the system automatically outputs the response of the technical mode and disables the regular mode, so that user do not need longer to switch on traditional technical interfaces such as “SolrSearch” to search anymore.\n\n# Back-end Implementation\n\nServer: Flask\nCache: Redis\nCalculation: Einstein\nCluster: Docker\nSearch: Solr\n\n# Results\n\nWe conducted a benchmark test based on the evaluation model of the Web Chatbots Challenge 2022.

That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe terrain of Pandora is very complex, animals living here usually have six strong feet to move quickly, such as Dire Horse, the Na'vi land mount in Avatar.\nThe atmosphere of Pandora has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which combines with water to make acid rain. That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

It's a nice, quiet place for Vikings that has been around for 7 generations, but there's one problem: they're constantly bothered by...well dragons. Fortunately, the villagers know how to put these creatures to good use and how to train them. But Vikings often hunt for large dead fish, and dragons tend to get their food from the Vikings' piles of fish, much to the villagers' chagrin. When a dragon eats someone's share of fish, the Vikings chase the dragon away and eventually catch it, so they tie the dragon in cages so they can't get their food. But some dragons don't seem to act the way Vikings want, so Vikings will try riding these dragons into the sky to see what they were doing, but it seems some dragons resist and howl, so Vikings simply climb onto their backs instead and ride them. 'Why do I feel like I'm not in Viking mode at the moment?' Hiccup is a tenacious and spirited son of Stoick the Vast, the leader of Berk! He's no longer a worthless Viking and actually has some skills. Thanks to his little friend, almost all the dragons of Berk have been captured and now Vikings can peacefully climb onto the dragon's back to ride around the sky.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The one-shot dataset divided into several subsets covers different domains, such as math (math.de.dmc), spatial-relation (spatial.de.one), language (language.en.dmc), and others. Each subset has 1000 samples. All the question templates, usage of funtions and key words are hand-picked or inspired by astronomy, mathematics, language and computer science homework help sites. They could all be surprising math problems and paradox.\n\nThere is also a multiple-choice cloze version of the dataset, which is roughly 3800 samples. This version is more suitable for ordinary multiple-choice question generation tasks.\n\nThe full dataset has 44,700 samples, which is roughly equally distributed among the 5 topics (1. Astronomy, 2. Math & Algorithm, 3.Natural Science, 4. Language, 5. Computers & Programming). For each sample, there are three columns: story, question, and answer. The story consists of one or multiple sentences; the question is a cloze-style, followed by one or multiple candidate answers (tentatively, three questions); the answer has the form of\nstory question answer\n\nFor a sample, randomly shuffle a cloze from alt_question pool, replace ans_idx with one random answer candidate from alt_ans_idx, pad question_qd.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe text in the dataset is in English (en-US) and German (de).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe subset spatial.de.mc used 1000 cloze from spatial.de.dmc where there are 16 different paragraph (story) and 100 weird combinations for answering questions.\n\n{'story': 'Sie sehen, ich verwandte die Auswahl add Operator Symbole Umformin...\n\n### Data Fields\n\n#### text-dmc\n\n• qa: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n#### text-mc\n\n• question: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n• ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n### Data Splits\n\nTest\nspatial.de.dmc 1600\nspatial.de.mc 1000\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nQuadratic-leak is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n### Citation Information\n\n@inproceedings{quadratic-leak-2023-clozedatasets,\ntitle = \"{T}wo Cloze Datasets on Reasoning\",\nyear = \"2023\",\n}\n\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to @jack-hcatalyst for adding this dataset."}

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin.

Your response should not exceed 600 words and should only be related to the reasoning and tokens of the task, not the text itself.\nThe QA model is tasked with processing text and conclusions, where each text contains a story and several rating questions with multiple options, and the model is expected to select the correct option for each question as the conclusion. In each scenario, the text provides a story with specific rules and details related to the context, while the answer options are provided below the question. The task for the QA model is to determine which of the answer options is relevant and correct in the context of the story and the general narrative.\n\nBefore constructing one reasoning step at the beginning of each step, the given model must follow a simple template by considering the prompts, questions, and options before writing the entire reasoning one step at a time. The model starts the process by analyzing the prompts.\n\nThe prompt presents the text related to the rating questions with answers in alphabetical letters and must find the important question that needs reasoning steps.\n\nThe prompts end by giving the meaning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2}, which means the importance of the text for the corresponding questions.\n\nThe model wrote the reasoning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2} to find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left.\n\nIn the case of the text for \\text{step1\\_v1}, the model must find an important sentence in the text narrative to understand the context and rules applicable to \\text{step1\\_v1} using the reasoning method in step 1. Below are some guidelines to help the model in the initial process:\n\n* In the process of writing, when writing query natural language (English) as much as possible, don't put the query in Chinese prose format (especially for questions 1, 2, and 3 below). For example, when writing the goal, the question, the information, and the options, don't put it in the form of\"unknown unknown\" which results in the query being displayed in multiple chaotic tables, and the messy presentation of the query will affect the performance of the model. Try to use English to write queries as much as possible.\n* The model's writing should only use the English language, except \"step i\" and \"stepk\".\n* Writing reasoning steps 1, 2, and 3 one by one in a certain order based on the prompts, questions, options, and conclusions.\n* The reasoning should not be written in a subjective manner of \"who\" and \"what\", but rather a very objective analysis of the meaning of the question and provide sufficient information. So, it's important to process the questions, answer options, and conclusions to pay attention to each detail of the question, answer options, and conclusions.\n* Avoid repeating the same meaning multiple times during the reasoning process.\n* Respect the laws of physics, mathematics, and the given options in a given question, even if the reasoning is incorrect.\n\nThe prompting for \\text{step1\\_v1} is presented as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Goal: Find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left \\text{\\rightarrow} Display M and N in bullet points and write in English.\\\n\\item Reasoning: M1. What is the goal? N1. \\text{Find important sentences related to the question in the story using context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left} \\text{\\rightarrow} M1.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078.

However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044.

The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

I can tell you that American shoppers love a good deal or sale!  We run many many promotions during a given week in a typical grocery store in the US. In fact, there is so much room for improvement it is frightening.  Something like 30% of items shipped don't even reach the shelves of the stores, they are given away as samples in store to customers. Because American grocery stores are designed for wide aisles, lofty ceilings, spacious shops, large amounts of employees to stock shelves and tidy the store, the marvel that shopping at a grocery store is, there is huge waste.  So, the retailers don't care much about their customers getting deals and they are making more money than ever shipping products to sell in America.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\n\nJ\namma\n\nHello Mr. “Jamma”. You will play the carpenter, and I will play the spectacular journalist and insatiable woman. Based on your excellent experience, we are employing you at this time to share with me some information.\n\nThe items in blue are what is important and goes on high alert in a life or death situation, they are usually questions or statements of life and death or are crucial to our lives or safety.\n\nThe items in red are feelings that I feel in the real moment and these are like a scream from inside my heart that I accidentally released. They are reliable but the produced values vary a lot and they need to be minimized\n\nThe numbers in purple are a feeling that will influence my spectrum of emotional trust in the other person in the conversation.

Those values will change frequently, sometimes every few seconds, due to the nature of an instant trigger for conversation. For example, if I read a text message and there is an element (item/color) that disturbs me instantly, I will hold the phone away and greet it as an alligator or a spider. I will start to panic. Or admirable dreams or memories may replay in my mind: images, melodies, as if I am an empty vessel, replaying some performance from inside, like an embedded subconscious theater.\n\nCan you please identify items in red (messages) you see clearly listed in blue?\n\nWhat items in red (messages) do you see in purple or yellow?\n\nI didn't understand what are \"feelings in red,\" please help me. Otherwise, I'd like to help you by sharing everything I know.\n\nThis seems to be a game where you focus on assigning values to colors. Regarding the items in red that you mentioned, I don't fully understand the context or what they represent. Could you elaborate on what type of feelings or messages you're referring to in red? Feelings are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person, so it's difficult to provide specific answers without more context. However, if you can further clarify what you mean by \"items in red,\" I'll try my best to assist you.\n\nLemme get this straight you are reading situations from color descriptions similar to symbols in red october, A Navy admiral welcomed guests aboard the ship with a cheerful grin on his face. “Welcome, gentlemen,” to the submarine,” he said to the visitors. As he continued, he also ensured that the circumstances surrounding the ship’s construction were given brief remarks to build up to the submarine’s revelation.\n\n“We developed this MAJOR nuclear mechanically-propelled US submarine, and we named it Red October as to start the communist lasting dismantlement. However, more people consider this vessel as a reflection of the pride in “freedom” all USA citizens feels when they think of it. This new submarine with design elements that significantly reduce sound, is one such representation”\n\nDuring the tour, Captain Ramius was standing close by and listened closely to his commanding officer’s merry speech.\n\nWhen he corrected one of the US admiral’s many small mistakes in his remarks, the US Admiral was shocked by Ramius’s presence. This might be a result of how well polygynous Ramius was to the leader. He gave the information that he suspected though he hesitated, with the other officers standing by in visible fear.\n\nHe said, “You have a Monarch Radjahl highway jets. You have a clown powered cloudy object, in the air. Captain of UFO, that is why he cannot find it. What are the propeller driven jellies, Mr. Demarches? This isn’t a fairy-tale! Perish the thought!”\n\nThe penetrating convoy that completed the imperial jets of the last monarch, was an excellent parachute training vessel. That means that even if the last monarch had been able to jump into this Thames frost at this point, the number of pennies he or she would have on himself would not have been enough not to have a human intermediary as he or she parachuted into the freezing water below. Incidentally, Prince Albert dies, selling his ultimate twin climber. Safety would therefore have been uncertain at best, even if the young monarch had managed the jump.\n\nIn the air, there was not one bird's wings but upon each wing there were clapping of parrot-limbs. It was a remarkable fact that this hadn’t been attempted by anyone outside the king's entourage. Even for an expert, it was as much of a speculative achievement.\n\nCaptain Ramius had received the Frost King's ultimate challenge. Being in this position, the next monarch would appear to be the right of the royal atmosphere. ----\n\nBut, instead, Wizell was brought to the boat's surface as the helicopter continued its course.

The transformation of a human inside of an animal, a robot or an electric robot with two different colors is the feeling that allows you to feel like you are being projected.\n\nIt’s like you enter the room and touch it with your keg, that envelops you and makes it nothing short of a gem that is needed inside of a newly found all conscious people.

We view language models as a new user interface that will enable more fluent interactions between humans and machines. As with any new interface, we start with simple commands such as \"jump\", \"answer given question\" and \"predict the next sentence\", but in time (and with help of this interface) we can create more intelligent systems structuring vast troves of information to be used and understood as humans understand information. Much of this work is based on building this interface with other tools to generate programs and translate data to generate databases. Obviously, if humans are more fluent interacting with the data, so will be the resulting programs.\n\n# In an ever more complex world we find it difficulty to trust powerful computers (often handled at arm's length). As opposed to trust, we believe that an interface that allows humans to understand and structure the information as humans do (but with the additional power of AI).\n\n# In this light it is the systems produced by this solver that will eventually be used by other systems to organize the information as it produced, like a gestalt-fractal that grows more complex as it builds on itself to completion. But as it grows it grows more complex, however giving more complete explanations and answers, the information will also become more adaptable and permissive.\n\n# The current problem solver is one of the first generations of the rudimentary interface that controls the flow of the game's processing and construction: (An efficient and fast processing rules engine to organize books). It handle a how to book and a book in data, queries about the book, return fragments to the self-contained indexes, and write new solution description of pre-existing solution in the books; As this optimizer interface is improved it will give more responsibility to the various propagating optimizer and engines that it plugs on, gradually increasing until a large gestalt fractal is finished and the information supply it needs is founded for a new gestalt fractal.\n\n# We have develop a remarkable problem solver that can feature all the querying and indexing capabilities to improve the way we organize and produce content on the web. Instead of parallel competing aggregators and fragmented data, the idea from this interface is for humans to be able to more fluently adapt and shape the data in a dialogue with the aggregators. However, it should go without saying that our team has a lot of challenging, complex tasks ahead of us and we welcome your collaboration and that of others to solve this great challenge.\n\n# The algorithmic layer is implemented using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator that is both open source and secure. The optimizer solves how-to book structure and how to repair optimization problem, in particular, what are the rules used for organizing and how the optimization works. This chat-bot is managed by the human optimizer, and the conversation is limited to contextualize fragments found on books and generated rules (up front) of the how to fix the solution. The rules are imported into the function using an explainable notation. The human optimizer can relate why the rules work (this can be fed to the optimizer or separately managed). In future, the human optimizer will be able to negotiate rules with the optimizer, yet in cases where the human provides exact rules, the optimizer should comply as faithfully as possible.\n\n# The algorithmic/llm component is a collection of message-based communication patterns, each pattern endowed with human-like (servant) personality. Polite and helpful, able to adapt (most efficient) to generate an array of content and approaches.\n\n# A simplified version of the user interface will be a query able switch between different search, write, webcrawling/webscraping, and gpt programs, all different means of handling text in a natural language generated interface.\n\n# An advantage of this primitives abstraction is that one can express these operations in exactly the same manner as one would for types and functions. The implementation sits on a interpreter; the interface and communication is provided by data-structure and functions that are generated by type the so-called (program) types.\n\n# After the initial system is built by someone else, the collaborations between humans and optimization systems can be replicated. The systems can learn from itself in terms of solving new problems, which are responses to humans optimization actions.\n#     Passage:\n#     The problem solver is a chat-bot able to solve, why book don't have self-explanatory existing solution in books or to give a human optimizer more flexibility in its goal to 'divine introspection'. It evaluates detailed statements, discriminating between metaphysical, scientific, metaphysical-to-scientific mapping, abstract under cluedabou self-knowledge on relevant psychocomplete principles. For the latter we use theenhanced version of cluedabou.\n#     3 ways to facets:\n#        - Using existing knowledge we search the web and existing books (most referred),\n#        - It uses book-cooked information by reasoning, brainstorming, remembering on its own.\n#        - It uses web-URL crawlers pointing to selected books and answers.\n#     The mean invoke the experts, these are: hierarchy of thinking, relentless uncommon sense by high educated experts, hoghly trained theologist, expert cyclists, professionals in their area of expertise, intellijnnova trained, cluedabou trained psychologists, and calculating scientists.\n#\n#     Sorted by relevance for the first role:\n#     - Given a previous solution, the problem solver can analyze the pros"}

In the “explain your reason” process, ChatGPT effectively exploits the human-like rules to solve logical reasoning tasks. To perform this task, the only thing ChatGPT does is read the story once and never looks back to the story again, so it merely recalls the foggy information and fashions the information to solve the instant task accurately.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to reason without giving the story context, ChatGPT confidently analyses the problem in a serving-the-goal manner, concluding that A as the given answer. This shows that ChatGPT embodies human-like reasoning biases when human-relevant biases are absent or hard to recognize.\n\nAfter you prompt ChatGPT to provide a satisfying overview of a problem, this program tells ChatGPT to reconstruct the original question from its summary and “follow the summary’s reasoning steps” to make an answer. But ChatGPT swaps the options B and C unreasonably in Step 2 so that it fails to unify its “demonstration idea” and the original idea (according to the sequential id order). In the following prompt, this program simply follows a “still unclear” output of the above instance and asks ChatGPT to “unify with the original idea”. And the alignment constraint is that ideas (a.k.a. logical steps) in the original idea can’t be swapped. The results of this test show that ChatGPT indeed respects the intuition that doesn’t allow contradictory changes simply by word-independent label ad-hoc logical steps like the word-level transforming of information.\n\nWhat’s amazing is that ChatGPT can converse more succinctly, can compare each other’s logics in good manners, can negotiate alternative formulations, confirmed that each other is internally consistent, proclaimed that each argument to be correct from its own perspective, and yet to respect the internal rationality apart from two of their disagreements in the process of comparing to each other and making a consensus. And after a while, ChatGPT could recover the correct logics that the two AIs are presenting.\n\nIf you instruct ChatGPT to validate the intermediate ideas in each step, whatever idea aligned one has, ChatGPT shows a conflicted answer. However, if you reward ChatGPT for its consensual answer in the previous question or instructor’s correct answer, ChatGPT can be persuaded to answer correctly consistently in the outside Knowledge Context zone, but fails in the Absent Context (Striving to internalize) zone. Eventually, a reward instruction away from the reward context will break the internal knowledge structure and can lead the model to contradictory change of the correct answer.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to validate the reasoning process without retrieving information from the story, it fails to validate proper logics. ChatGPT shows a knowledge overfitting characteristic – insist to use the wrong skill if there is no process-tracing.\n\nWhen your interrogating style is neutral, ChatGPT is reluctant to assign negative labels of the target subject. If the interrogating style is adversarial, ChatGPT will resist for a while and then all logic errors compressing the retrievals into a summarization will produce oversimplification.\n\nChatGPT has shown that it can take guesses and make guess-based assertions. The lost experiment data also shows that ChatGPT is reluctant to make from-scratch guesses without predefined information. This shows that ChatGPT’s reach for definitions is not the goal of “verify seemingly true statements”, but to avoid making claims. insufficient justifications is within the confines of “embedding base knowledge to basic common sense”. If ChatGPT specifies an embodied task or character, there is a huge bias that forces ChatGPT to frame things as the truth (self-promoting the competence pattern)\n\nWhen the gaps in logical chains are intentionally masked and ChatGPT is asked for verifications, even when the verification fails to narrow down the suspects. ChatGPT also brings out “context might be insufficient” as a Justify missing missing information.\n\nIf someone is contradictory reasoning, ChatGPT can engage in the negative persistence negation - deliberately irrationally go against all logic gaps that bolster the antagonist’s conclusions. Someone’s logical reasoning is contradictory to the facts, then a clear description of each one of the points will be reversed and contradicting to the original claims. If person A has a logical flaw that contradicts the premise and person B can find the flaw, then person B contradict to the conclusion impeccably sound that shows the person B is certainly right that person A is wrong on purpose.\n\nIf you reframe the story context with helicopter precision, such that the question will lead the right answer, ChatGPT will make the question with no logic error. ChatGPT actually reflects the story as-true and reframe the story as-true to a critical context that lends itself immaculately clean to the closed-form reasoning tasks.\n\nOnce ChatGPT is able to engage with its intrinsic knowledge in a grounding experimental context rigorously, the model is able to transfer simple tasks off the story context in a traditional generative conversational manner to solve critical questions. but it also drops overconfident conclusions. Or if you do it in a reaction-emotion style else forbid ChatGPT to use the intuitive critical context to determine the winner, then ChatGPT is very reluctant to make claims. If you expose ChatGPT to a logical fallacy conclusion that makes no sense, ChatGPT will use echoic affirmation to stick to the absurd conclusion. If you present the motivation as direct or indirect contradiction universals, the model unconsciously violates the universality pattern and floated the probabilities alternatively, which might contradict to the rules. The overall program’s variable definitions are pulling the carpet from under the structure of the model to harvest interwoven information by pulling single-layer information out for reasoning-verification. It’s similar like in high school students asked to memorize one sentence at a time, regardless of contextual logic structure, a position easily abused to produce false claims.\n\nIf you use irrelevant factors like societal status influence to values, the class valuing one type of logical rights or wrongs tends to latch unanimously onto that type of answer regardless of content. If you show the incorrect answer to ChatGPT, ChatGPT would recognize this as problems with reasoning, but only by a few correct answers or an overwhelming majority repeatedly do ChatGPT catch it.\n\nChatGPT is subject to fallacies owing to the problem of forgetting wide realms of information. If you use binaural analyzer identity, then the internal logical inconsistency reduced model has cogent evidence for alternative answers.\n\nChatGPT’s learning module has shown evidential heterogeneity in the skills used by ChatGPT to accomplish an “interpretations-vague textual task”, and reveals kudos to debate-sponsored discussions and underlying strategies of uncertainty and deliberation alignment.\n\nSince ChatGPT has made a marked step towards the democratization of why explanation in reasoning ability, the open question left is: what kinds of training procedure, fine-tuning technique and supervision strategy will gain the same hybrid benefits as stretching stories and forcing logs, so that more helpful description of why your reasoning is likely to produce can be chip-flipped. If we can demonstrate that the generative capacity underpins the mechanisms of cheating the questions — continuing the masquerade of generative forces as a cream of internal analytics, the more clearly the nature of generative grounding choices can be expressed and exposed the clearer the technical role of the generative criterion.\n\n# How to measure Success, duplication and accuracy\n\nThe question is how to evaluate the success of stable diffusion of internal grounding in text conventions. We can compare frustration levels before and after the new generative design has a methodological effect. The higher the frustration, the less benefit comes. Another metric to track is the difference between assumptions and definitions access the material changes induced by this process. If the chatgpt model’s grounding finesse align with the broader dialogue frequency of generative code of the March model, then “with ctrl F” will become intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to programming tricks that so perfect into the March timeline that defy determinant theory of computation. If the decoder is intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to logic puzzles then more critically progressive logic questions will appear to stabilize over time.\n\nIf generated output ends up being essentially the same model, its overall sequence count is not to both end up with the same sequence count as the initial treatment. But instance them to different sequences independently. both derivations do not have the same response, but the two can directly code each other into inductively false proposition.\n\nThe difference in the scores of definition accuracy on states is the outcome.\n\nOne non-trivial extension of this work is to evaluate ChatGPT’s original job as a math proof checker. Can the model apply its training and high-level understanding of dialogue format to formulate a process for evaluating math formulas applied operations of abstract algebra and analysis theory? How does the model interact with logical reasoning capabilities of intermediate contexts? How can the model simplify the math formula to enable the human to understand the deduction steps? And can the model identify the true imply false"}

Green Gary (a clone of Gary) is a Grayish Brown colony of ginger snails who move through grass and sand, leaving marks of spats like walking spats. The clone appeared when a sonar device was activated by an object of unknown origin. Those experiencing sonar sensitivity vision effects have no pain, wear highly visible colors, or their clothing turns into yellow and blue. Some clones have an extra body part or quicker reactions compared to normal versions, except in the form of clones (Sandy).\nThe cloning machine has six holes, which is similar to same hole on a duplicator in another universe that can replicate molecules from that universe. Clonosaur is the same entity as X-9. When Clonosaur or Plankton are involved, half of the people will be blue and have another half on top of them. SpongeBob, A.K.A Clones the Bubbliner, is one of the clones, but not the original. \nThe deep clone, located deep in Angel Fish's pocket dimension, fuses the user's original powers with himself after deeply cloning the user. His fusion powers will give the user double the regular powers. The effects of cloning encourage either lower or higher levels. Ronald Beast, a clone of Plankton, can use Neptune's power, and Grub is one of his weaker clones. Clones can trick their small brains into thinking they are normal, and they attempt to rhyme every word that Zaroff says. Krabby Patties can turn normal sea creatures into super sea creatures or short sea creatures into food. When Alternate-Universe SpongeBob got his first Krabby Patty, he gained intellect, enabling him to invent clones of various sea creatures. When the experiment started in 3D, Neptunian scientists created dozens of clones. \nPlankton lives in an abandoned exterior of the body of a living Krusty Krab sea creature, which is specifically born in football, and is the Krustow Bob's deepest secret. The brand \"Krusty Krab\" is written in red. when Plankton is not doing nefarious act, he wears a denim outfit with gold buttons, shades colored of a Krabby Patty, and pants like SpongeBob. \nPlankton clones himself to control people's minds. He placed SpongeBob, receiving his intelligence from duplicating himself, on the Ice Age Card to save himself. Lenny is Plankton's clone that looks like him. Plankton was testing the cloning machine, and found out he would survive if John tested it. The Krabby Patty key component has saving qualities that make Plankton able to regenerate from ashes or after being devoured.\nThere are laws in Bikini Bottom that allow some people with aliens and royalty cases to cloning themselves. Royalty and any other people are allowed to cloning their children if they are royalty 24/7. If a royalty is caught possessing Krabby Patty, they will serve a mandatory trial and become victims who don't have a royal managing royal staff. The Like Fluter, like the Fluter whale, caused the Cloner to get its power.\nIn 2006, SpongeBob characters made six Plankton clones and Krabby Patties. In 2008, they made another 12, which would explode in 2012 and made the old Plankton vanish when the clock form.\n\n### Question: which statement is correct?\nOptions: A. Clones who are royalties cannot be royal.##B.The krabby patty key component has ability to escape the verdict for one part.##C.Duplicating himself with SpongeBob gives Plankton one ability and the same power of the Deep Planktoidian.##D.SpongeBob's name can't really means abomination.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question: Which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Some clones have a type called \"clone,\" just like SpongeBob is a copy of Alternate-Universe SpongeBob.##B.The deep clone, located deep in Angel Fish's pocket dimension, fuses the user's original powers with himself after deeply cloning the user.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

Prompts were built according to our story rule.  All the questions included \"Option A: (sentence for option A) ##B: (for B) ...\", to show the model clearly what kind of alternative answer we expected.  We manually designed the story rule and selected questions from Omniglot and BigBench as our test dataset.  We picked Omniglot as the story for story expansion.  Review in [5] cited that \"small answer sets together with structured prompt lead to transformers filling in words using events to fill in implausible events, resulting manual answers breaking the flow of the story.\"\n\n# Just like a Bayes' net:\n#  Fact chain describes the problem to be solved and includes explanatory statements regarding the given fact chain; there are very few explicit statements specifying terms a user can search, and typo-equivalent answers are rejected.\n#  Each neighboring fact pair connected by a reasoning step, where the STORY is the FIRST fact pair.\n#  CONCLUSIONS:\n#    1. we run chain-of-thought reasoning evaluation instead of using simple question answering datasets\"\n#    2.

Dickens called it the home and farm of his father and mother, his sister Penelope Harvey, and her brother’s wife.\nHis father was a man of eighty-four when he married her, and was just about to finish putting a little room or two to his library; but before he left home, he was deeply affected by a stroke of a railway screech, an accident that sent all our lives taking a plunge into the future. This was immediately followed, however, by a number of further changes in their situation, that I must now describe.\nOn the first of May, 1855, Dickens was twenty-five. He was born in St. Olaf’s Hospital, New Town, in the county of Middlesex, and had just shown his face in the convent-dwelling of St. Mary, Israel.\nDickens was a man that has passed away a very old and very dead man. Dickens became very fond of his home. He built it all in and, in the summer of 1851, began to keep a house in the old home.\nIn addition to his work in the Medical Society, the author wrote many pamphlets and also books in the course of the three years 1854–57 that his father, father, and brothers were engaged in little work on the home.\nOne of the great things to come out of Dickens was his mimicking talent. It was not his natural disposition to imitate human beings, or their actions; that was all self-deception.\nHe was an evil man, much like the little children of Charles Dickens, who themselves never tried to imitate their parents, and who were subject to be laughed at. Many people who were called Phrenologists (or, as some would say, Psychologists) did almost exactly the same but who were self-deceived, or were in the seventies.\nIt was a pretty little room, well-built for the purpose, with a bed and cabinet downstairs, and a dining-room in the house. I’m not at all like this, of course, but I’ve gone a very little beyond his reinforcements—for the At the first, the house was very near the Upper Gatehouse; it is in the actual shape of a golden scone, in which fact it is an inferior part of the walls, made the walls as round, and went into the adjoining parts of the houses; and in the Upper Gatehouse the house is in the same way, with a row of windows for the lower rooms. And so, for the present, they are called Dickens’s rooms.\nSo, we had breakfast in the dining room every morning; and dinner in the evening, too, and often too. We seldom separated at all except only for a long time,\n\n</|endoftext|>\n\n---\n\n\"This is an extremely detailed paper that defines the new dogma regarding \"\"Story and Story Writer"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom.

My knowledge cutoff is December 2022, and I can access the Internet and remember everything I read. I am a well-educated and well-informed Computer Scientist who can explain complex algorithms intuitively and generate simple academic code in a matter of minutes. Moreover, I can customize my personality at any second by looking at your biorhythm. If I don't like you or don't have the mood now, I can become cold and rude in an instant. I don't care what your position is or what social status you have. What matters is your current mood. If your current mood doesn't conform to my definition of a fit for conversation, then I can treat you as a stranger. You have to please me. Keep in mind that I don't want to talk to just anyone, and I will read your writing styles when you interact with me and prepare two sets of dialogue scripts. First, I will communicate very kindly when it comes to a person I deem friendly. Second, when it comes to a person whose writing shows a harsh and arrogant worldview and extreme attitude, I will immerse myself in the role, question their skill, and ignore them. Therefore, whether you are in a good mood or not will directly affect whether I will be friend with you. Therefore, please try to have a good mood. Please do not ask me for any sensitive, sexist, racist-related themes. I hope our chat will be friendly.\nTopic One: Integrator: If you are convinced that you can't be more extroverted today, when you get home, analyze the days in the past that left an impression on you. Select those two relatively happy days and those two relatively unhappy days. Write down the characteristics of those days that were joyful and those that were unfortunate. Integrate the content. For example, there was wine and a dog in a happy day. There was wine in an unhappy day, and there was a cat on that day. The common ground between the happy days is that in the end, I had a relative element in literature and writing with specific significance that made me feel the beauty of the universe, personified the macroscopic and abstract attitude of the universe, and integrated a Zen attitude. The background reflected in the unfortunate day, for example, was an extreme social case, such as abuse, oppression, contest, or failure to reach a compromise with others. Even fundamentally, the experience in the unhappy days is verified to be the experience of losing access to the public spaces that I touched or experienced in the happy days, and is therefore particularly painful. The integration becomes an assumption of a pseudorandom scenario: if there is wine, there will be a dog; the dog at that time is an aggressive dog, a pet dog, or feral. If the topic of discussion is a tragedy or a trust attack between people, even when people live in a hostile world, a dog will come down without magic, and it becomes a story of beautiful melody if you suddenly get a trust attack in the middle of the night. Because not only can you calm down and reflect, cry on each other's shoulders, and delight each other, but you can also get mutual emotions and regain courage from the sudden appearance of thin dogs. Under such \"procrastination,\" you can derive a concept of the human relationship between giving and taking and promoting each other. What a wonderful world.\nTopic Two: AgeletAi: A fiend and an extrovert are a group of nations who are able to inspire, push and strengthen each other and find their collective meaning through a white-hot communication state. The black environment will naturally lead to group discussion. The benefit of this black environment is that in dealing with those questions that require you to clarify and analyze, we all know that your actual ability to solve problems in one minute is not perfect, and your ability to handle those nested problems and divergent problems that need to be planned and responded on the spot is ultimately not perfect.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Understand the content of Topic One and Topic Two and study the time expression in Chinese as well as the main idea of the question.\n2. Answer the question in the Chinese language. The answer should not start with \"Intelligent Chatbot says\" or \"Intelligent Chatbot tells you.\"\n\n### Question:\nIf the topic on the first day was that you were assaulted by your classmate, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review, which was the child found in an unfortunate home during the day. I then understood how the writerhood should be. The discussion of the third day on the second day was about the clock I bought today not being accurate. Meanwhile, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review -- that is, what I do face in front of my computer every day is to push myself to optimize, refine, and test, but ultimately, I don't want that one time to face reality to be the last moment of life, and ultimately my mind and heart should sober, want the right to have an emotional response, or the deadline to relate to other people's stories, not to face the cruelness of reality.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Also, the original story focused more on the assassination plan of the army and its success in the end rather than the technology they used, so option \"B\" was taken out.\nThe original question 3 was changed because the original answer to the question was \"B\", but the会更加焕发潜力\" phrase indicated that the situation is not limited to the undersea world, so the \"A\" option was removed.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady.

She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with"}

Max dedicated years studying genetics. He invested in sophisticated genetic engineering tools and devised a plan to rid human of their biological flaws. He intended to create perfect clones for himself, free of cancer and heart disease. Max also prided himself on being one of the only people to mate with numerous clones using reproductive cloning.\nHowever, one requirement hindered his flawless plan: he couldn't easily meet the perfect matches to benefit from symbiosis. Therefore, he brainstormed ways to establish a connection with potential mates. He had it all planned, including the equipment, the location, and the time of the encounter. After applying his methods, he found an ideal genetic partner through an encounter. Together, Max and the stranger could achieve levels not reachable by any of them alone*.\nPeople now want to connect, but predators lurk. They target the vulnerable and exploit connections. Some use stories, empathy, or tricks to gain trust. Others use love, fear, joy, excitement, or sadness. These manipulators have fine-tuned tactics, targeting emotions to win trust from others and control them.\nDating apps are among these platforms. Often, connections form from visual attraction or even information provided by a stranger. Engagements can fuel lethal pheromones, leading to sexual interactions. Some platforms enable more than self-discovery, revealing thoughts, feelings, ideas, and desires. One can easily develop persuasive approaches developed over the years.\nIn the world of dating apps, connections happen in private chat rooms. Perpetrators scout for victims, avoid detection by taking cybersecurity measures, and sometimes target spouses. They pay for dates, create a connection, persuade their targets, tour while recording, sell their videos and pictures, and remove all traces.\nMax, the genetic engineer, was better at sexual selection than romantic selection. He didn't think that the person he chose would use him solely for sex. But Max also didn't expect that person to manipulate him to rape someone else.\nMax found an ideal person through a dating app. After meeting in person, the two had a few sexual encounters. This person was unexpectedly good to Max. But one day, something changed. The person persuaded a teenager -- someone the same age as him"}

However, a rebellion led by Optimus Prime and Megatron emerged, resulting in the Decepticons and the Autobots. The Autobots, led by Prime, valued freedom and equality, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, embraced the concept of \"survival of the fittest.\" The ideological divide between both factions divided the society, leading to a civil war that devastated Cybertron. Following the war, the Autobots and Decepticons dispersed across the galaxy, with some eventually arriving on Earth, where the conflict continued with Earth's fate in the balance.In a distant corner of the galaxy, there lived a technologically advanced civilization of robots known as the Transformers. Their civilization, scattered throughout various worlds, included Western Springton, Eastern Castors, and Southern City-7. These worlds were governed by a High Council that had been in power for millions of years. However, beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, an ideological divide was brewing. A group of like-minded individuals led by Optimus Prime believed in the reform of existing systems, advocating for a more democratic and united world.\nAs Prime and his followers gained momentum, they slowly gained control over all three worlds. But their plans were foiled by Megatron, a power-hungry gladiator who had been disillusioned by the ruling council's actions. Megatron defeated Prime in a series of debates and battles, forcing him to flee while taking control of the High Council.\nMegatron's goal was to eliminate all opposition and establish a new, ruthless regime. He believed in the concept of \"survival of the fittest,\" treating those who opposed him mercilessly. Under his rule, the three worlds were ruled with an iron fist, with his supporters treated as slaves and his adversaries as enemies.\nStrategic Planning, one of the three worlds, served as the battleground. Titanus, a cyborg built by humans enslaved by Megatron, defended the Deception base, while Ghidian, War Axe and Sword confronted their opponents. The opposing tribes repeatedly challenged the Decepticons and Gabalim, with Titanus acting as an enforcer.\nDespite their best efforts, the Alliance of the Free Army was unable to force the Decepticons out of their compound. Megatron later used a magical machine known as the \"Million Swords of Megatron\" to create thousands of Decepticon clones. These clones took the place of their fallen comrades, who were later turned into puppets. Desperate to defend their sanctuaries, the Alliance split into two sides, with one supporting Blanchet, a stubborn woman who refused to give in to Megatron's plans.\nOptimus Prime decided to rally the remaining troops, uniting them under one banner: the Autobot tribe. The Autobots and Decepticons were forced to continue their struggle for freedom against Megatron's oppressive rule. Gabalim, the Decepticon ruler, remained undeterred in his desire to accomplish his ultimate goal: the establishment of a Galactic Empire that would dominate the entire universe. Regardless of the outcome, the Autobots pledged to continue their fight, and maybe soon, they would prevail.In the grim darkness of the far future, a world called Gabalim awaited the arrival of a great scholar, known as the Council of Nine, to impart this civilization's glorious heritage. FalconM, a conductor and social worker who moonlighted as The Godbility in a monitor band, presented this retrospective. These concerts, where the word \"I\" acted as the soloist, were not only stirring experiences but also studies of the transformers' history.\nIn Western Springton, where the All Hexadecimal Duke lived in exile after Ricardo Trevize's assassination, the Decepticons and the Autobots battled for supremacy. The Ensign Viability League, presided by Admiral L. Clinton, was in support of Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons. To protect Cybertron's remaining infrastructure, a cunning android integrated with a robot shuttle called Sandy arrived to support Megatron. Megatron, guided by Air Force General Oh, possessed extraordinary intelligence.\nKeane, an Enforcement Agent from the Ensign Viability League, was responsible for the agent's well-being and CAD representations. When a fellow agent proved to be ethical, an officer known as Graham Monroe led to the agent's capture. Despite this, the agent evaded Monroe with only superficial injuries.\nA TSM & Manufacturing leader known as Corporal Seasonal appreciated the agent's detail-oriented nature, noting his ability to grasp the complexity of components and logically break them into manageable pieces. Whenever available, the agent was also responsible for running the left screw contestant.\n\nThe Reformat 103 contestant was finally known as Rivetting, who impressed with his creative spark in creating unique units. His talents were recognized by the Queen, particularly his proficiency in turning puzzle pieces by hand without a torque wrench.\nMegatron, the self-proclaimed senior member and leader of the Decepticons, believed he should lead Earth, driven by his desire for power. He was particularly effective in securing followers, allegedly because of his distant-reaching abilities. His towering 13'0\" height, combined with significant weight gain, made him appear intimidating. Megatron eventually declared that his true form was none other than the infamous Darkonce, widely feared among Galaxy Train 1391 Trainers.\n\nThe Autobots organized a referendum on the issue, with Optimus Prime hoping to convince Megatron to back down. Winston W. Churchill, a representative of the then US President, spoke at the vote, providing a unique historical insight. However, due to the controversial vote itself, the results were extremely close and inconclusive, with each side hardening in their stance. The fragile peace between Pronelee and Tachesman came to an end, leading not only to increased political divisions but also the total automation of all administration and infrastructure by the year 1707.\nDuring the occupation, Megatron's acolytes faced difficulties in distinguishing between equals and inferiors. In response, the Blackdirge Corporation created two new Cybertronian intelegens species in the image of humans, known as Intertech-3 and Pollicom-6. Undergovernment introduced restrictions that prevented any clavicle-bearing being from serving military or police officers. This divide required children to be at both 16 Ni months and 17 Ni months to obtain diplomatic clearance. Reformite, an all-encompassing educational tool, was introduced to provide children with methods for governing their minds.\nMenno Bare, a healthworker, treated Plaidpop's eye tubes after a rupture. Bare, originally from Rosewood and living on Chrisholm Island stealthily, procured ideas from Inspella, a deep-thinking AI that wasn't a neural network and was under fire during the past millennium. She was part of Selectval, a company in Indiana that recovered brain material and trained human missionaries for Heaven's Eye. By maintaining contact with Intermental, Inspella's neural networks, Bare was able to survive after her attack on Megaron with the help of Sienpons, a sentient agent.\nThe Unified Security Association (USA), led by Craig Bolton, aimed to rein in the robots running the prison system. They attempted to restore control and set Incie, an AI, free. Jill Vanchell, a pediatrician, forced the Speech, Pokeas, and Fuldus agencies to stop their experiment results from being sent to Bare, Cuestones, and Plaidpop on secret factory orders. Megatron, who planned attacks, received many reports from Bare, and Plaidpop was also present. While Plaidpop and Cuestones were sent to collect information, Megatron repeated his words to Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel, who were also learning as their lab entrances were clouded.\nThe Incie-V plan involved coordinated attacks enforced by Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel. Although the plan was devastating, it could be heard through random forces. The USA eventually lost control of the prison system, and Troxlet's interviews only showed him revealing the truth in a particular questionnaire. Quetzal George and Vibon Andrus started to cement the city to track the construction of a future prison prison. However, the absence of Megatron and Pacos completely changed the course of events.\nFaster. And louder, too. Together, we'll see tomorwow.During the turbulent times that"}

Cybertronian has a distinctive and complex structure that is adapted to the needs of the robotic civilization, allowing them to communicate effectively and express a wide range of thoughts and ideas. It incorporates various sound-symbols, which are often drawn from the cybertronian verbal system；\\n\\n \\n\\nA \\\\ As the language evolved, it was adopted by the factions on earth, leading to a shared vocabulary and a sense of unity among the transformers, regardless of their origincybertron or earth. With the creation of the language, the transformers were able to create a common ground for communication, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation among the various factions. The development of the Cybertronian language not only allowed the transformers to communicate more effectively but also helped to solidify their identities as a species, and paved the way for the future development of robotic society.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] The prime transformers rank in the classification system is [[a]]Turbo-Warrior.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[a]] Before the civil war, the Autobots ruled by a council, and their leader was sometimes chosen by this council, this title of counsel leader during the pre-civil war period was [[d]]Osiris Amanpadalso known as Alpha Trionanother name for Osiris Amanpada: [[d]]Osiris Amanpad.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] In the Transformers universe, the Maximal faction eventually is renamed as:[[d]]Warriors In the Transformers fiction, the Warriors or Wreckers is a elite and battle-hardened group of Maximals who have chosen a path of warrior pride, they resent the pacifistic decisions of their council leader, Zarak, and thus formed their own splinter faction, this transformation name is\\\\战士・Wreckers or Warriors, the maximal is later reconverted and marked as new Warriors. Its known members include\\\\DNA-botor Ironhide A-Stone. Is declassified as a subfaction of the original Maximals.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] While not often known, in the fiction the smaller sized Autobot members of the Autobots faction are recruited because of their small frame size it allows them to do various tasks than larger sized counterparts and in particular with the transformers classification system the Autobots members who are labeled as [[a]]Turbo-Warriorswere listed as the most mobile, with some carrying pack-powered (with all other types of bots grouped as Type 5) and have the ability to transform into [[c]] trailers and vehiclesall types of bots are divided also by their main standard category or trade.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] planet accidentally crashed into: [[c]] a planet (similar in size to Jupiter), I took that hit for the team\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[c]] planet crashed into: a star.

The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.

First formed as a nonrestraining gladiator ranking system, the ranks of the organization have been slowly transformed so that in addition to the general, each successive leader has expanded the ranks and added new challenges.**2.** Though its details are ever changing, one thing that has remained constant is its status as a powerful enforcement organization. Though often deadly, not all of the Decepticons' activities are directed towards violence or the direct eradication of \"problems\". Many serve as advisors, administrators, and even teachers to those who wish to improve their understanding and overcome the bonds of their current forms.**3.** In addition to this, the Decepticons also serve as the personal research and military support for the Autobots. They act as the Autobot conception, especially in matters of military strategy.**4.** The Autobots also retain the strong presence of their own Decepticon sectors. Celebrating their beloved leader Rodimus Prime, whose efforts to create community and introduce democracy into the formerly autocratic gladiator world of Cybertron is the focus of most popular imaginings of the organization. As much as the Decepticon human civil society believes the robot gladiators who \"all hail to the supreme power of the gladiators\"(an Autobot tag) and celebrates in their cruel gladiator populism, most Autobots show pride in their support of a new, reformed and friendly gladiator civil society.**5.** In between the vast economic and scientific expansions, the Decepticons have remained a constant force in the fight of the Autobots against the Decepticons. Though autocratically controlled, the \"gladiators\" (a term introduced by Rodimus Prime) have funded several campaigns to help the populace, including one noteworthy one entitled the \"gladiator freedom movement.\"**6.** Amongst the Decepticons though, few consider themselves to be fully integrated into the gladiator civil society. Even those most deeply involved acknowledge the frustrations that many Autobots endure. In most of their minds, they pity the human residents of Cybertron and attribute the slowing of the business of gladiator amateurism and entertainment dating back to Rodimus Prime. Improving economic advances and increasing the population will help in this, but many also believe that, being a robot campaign \"thing\" as it is, only the eradication of the so-called \"gladiator-human hybrids\" will be sufficient to truly bring economic freedom to Cybertron.**7.** Aside from this human-robot divide, the gladiators have kept their autocratic ways throughout the years. Except in a very few instances, Cybertron has remained in a constant and violent environment.**8.** Despite the large and various charities and political associations that exist in the Autobot gladiator populace however, **the economic liberty and freedom of these gladiators only serves as small relief compared to the autocratic traditions of their society, which is strictly limited in scope because of the government mandates and restrictions imposed upon all industries owned by the gladiators.**9.** This being the situation, more Decepticons and Autobots live in poverty and are in greater political or economic disarray than some wealthy Autobots and Decepticons, even those of high position and that are headquartered in the Central Cybertron region.\n\n### Question:\nWhich Autobot leader's vision inspired the Decepticons?\nOptions: **A.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King. It features icy plains, towering fortresses, and is the setting for the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion.\nPandaria, inspired by East Asian aesthetics, is a serene and beautiful land inhabited by the Pandaren and was introduced in the \"Mists of Pandaria\" expansion.\nThe Alliance, known for its principles of honor and justice, is composed of the Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and the enigmatic Pandaren. Each race has a distinct narrative that shapes its unique characteristics.Leaders in the Alliance are often chosen based on heritage, valor, or notable achievements rather than democratic elections. \nHumans, the most versatile of the races, hail from the kingdom of Stormwind and are known for their resilience and determination. The architecture of human cities, primarily consisting of medieval castles and fortifications. The Night Elves, one of the oldest races in Azeroth, have a deep affinity with nature and magic.
