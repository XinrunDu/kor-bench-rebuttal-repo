Using distributive law (5): \\((p \\text{&} q) \\text{|} (p \\text{&} \\text{!}q) \\text{::=} p \\text{&} (q \\text{|} \\text{!}q)\\).\n3. Using (8): \\( q \\text{|} \\text{!}q \\text{::=} 1 \\).\n4. Thus: \\( p \\text{&} (q \\text{|} \\text{!}q) \\text{::=} p \\text{&} 1 \\text{::=} p \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( p \\text{::=} (p \\text{&} q) \\text{|} (p \\text{&} \\text{!}q) \\) is valid.\n\n### Part (2): \\( (p \\text{&} \\text{!}q) \\text{|} (\\text{!}p \\text{&} q) \\text{::=} (p \\text{|} q) \\text{&} \\text{!}(p \\text{|} q) \\)\n\n1.

Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nDuring a break at a seminar, three attendees tried to determine where Professor Wang is from based on his accent.

Either \\( p \\) or \\( q \\) is false, or \\( r \\) is true.\n   - \\( \\neg p \\land q \\) is false: This implies \\( p \\) cannot be false and \\( q \\) cannot be true simultaneously.

The examples given show different objects (hands, stones, iron block) all undergoing movement and generating heat.\n   - This fits the pattern because movement (S) and heat generation (P) occur together in various cases.\n\n2. **Method ؆**:\n   - Requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. The examples given do not clearly indicate that heating does not occur without movement, so this method is less applicable.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**:\n   - Requires a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. The scenario does not provide a negative group where movement is absent and heat is absent, so this method is not applicable.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**:\n   - Requires changes in S to correspond to changes in P.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]", "response_origin": "The causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with the **⸮ method**. \n\nIn the passage, the presence of radioactivity (P) is observed in multiple cases where uranium (S) is present, even when other conditions (A, B, C, etc.) differ.

Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions.

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
