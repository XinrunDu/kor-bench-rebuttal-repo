Evaluate the innermost expression: (~p1&p2)\n   - Since the priority of negation (~) is higher than the priority of conjunction (&), we first evaluate the negation of p1 and then apply the conjunction.\n   - Thus, (~p1&p2) has no false assignments.\n\n2.

The formula ~ has 1 logical connective and is at Level C.\n2. The formula & has 2 logical connectives and is at Level C (counting the (~) as part of Level B or Level C, with nested, but after raising of nesting not in order, up to \"~p1\"), or you could regard & as at Zn.

To determine its level, we need to identify the logical connectives and their compositions.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the formula into Level B formulas\nThe given formula can be broken down into two main components:\n1. (~(p1=::>~p2))\n2. ((p3||p4)=~p1)\n\nBoth of these components are Level C formulas, as they contain nested logical connectives. However, we can further simplify them by identifying their Level B subformulas.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the Level B subformulas\nWithin the first component, ~(p1=::>~p2) can be viewed as a single Level B formula with a \"not\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p1=::>~p2. \n\nWithin the second component, (p3||p4)=~p1 can also be viewed as a single Level B formula with an \"if and only if\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p3||p4 and ~p1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the composition of the Level C formula\nThe original formula combines these two Level C formulas with an \"and\" connective. Here, both components come from simplifying the composition of logical connectives on their respective subformulas.\n\n## Step 5: Classify the formula based on its structure\nSince the original formula contains more than one logical connective and at least one multi-level subformula (especially considering p1=::>~p2 which already contains several logical levels), it is clear that the formula's structure does not belong to a basic Level A or solitary Level B formula. Counting the fact that we actually have nested components whose structure exceeds a simple 2-level structure. \n\n## Step 6: Classify the level according to the number of nested logical connectives\nBased on this analysis, the level of the given formula can be calculated. Level A has 0, Level B has 1, Level C has at least 2.\n\nLevel C has been identified as the least level matching our criteria, we describe the formula, which has even a more complex structure: \nboth formula are connected by \"&\" to a larger formula.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final classification of the formula\nWhen we analyze the structure of the formula, we realize that its true complexity surpasses the initial calculation due to multiple nested connectives so that the simplified criterion applied here predicts the minimal Level matching the number of nesting inside such Level B structures inside full-powered Level C subformula.\n\nThe final answer is: [[Z]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL",

(5)\n- (p3||p4)=~p1 is Level D formula (6)\n- The final formula (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) is Level E formula (7)\n\nSince 7 is a value above 26 in the alphabet order, the letter we are corresponding with is more than Z in our alphabet substitution (where Z is the 26th letter).\nGiven that, our level for that current problem should be replaced with a letter in which Z represents the 26th letter and the number that follows the letter will represent number larger than 26 and we will pick the number that corresponds to the value.\n \nTherefore the value is greater than Z, and one letter from the set, instead we have  the number that corresponds to the value. \n2 is the number that corresponds to one more than the value that is to be marked by the last position in our alphabet

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n≥1).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as ✓, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,✓|✓|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|✓,x|✓|✓ are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only ✓|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is:\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n✓|✓|✓,✓|✓|x,✓|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|✓,x|✓|✓\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[C];[B]]", "response_origin": "To determine the correctness of the formula, let's analyze each sub-question:\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nTo check if it's a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula, we need to examine all possible assignments. \n\nFor p1=::>(p1||p2||p3), \n\n- If p1 is true, it will validate regardless of the values of p2 and p3, as it allows for all possible combinations of p1 through p3 being true. Hence, it will be true with these assignments p1|✓|✓, p1|✓|x, p1|x|✓, p1|x|x, p1|✓|✓.\n- If p1 is false, it's contingent on p1||p2||p3 being true, but p1 being false means it will be false if either p2 or p3 is false. So, it's also possible for this to fail given these conditions too.\n\nSince the formula (1) has at least p2 being false & p3 being false so that even though  p1 being false allows the then generally, the conditions aren't met, What are the total possible scenarios:\n\nNow for formula  (1): p1DXVECTOR p1||p2||p3)\n|p1  |p2  |p3  |Output |  p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)  |-p1|  p2  |p3  |p2  p3|✓|✓ |✓|✓ ✓|✓|✓ |✓|x|✓ |✓|x|x |x|x|✓ |x|x|x x|✓  x|x  |x|x|✓ |✓|✓|x |✓|x|x |x|x|x |-p1|x  p2  |p3|✓  p2||p3|(✓|✓)-p1|x|x x|x  x|x|(x|x|-p1|x|✓  x|x|x x|x|x -\n\nLet's break down the table above into true (✓) and false (x) for p1=::>(p1||p2||p3).\n\nTrue (✓) - p1=::>(p1||p2||p3): \n      - p1 is true, where p2 & p3 could be true or false.\n      - p1 = false, where p2 & p3 are true. \n\nFalse (x) - p1=::>(p1||p2||p3):\n      - p1 = false, where p2 or p3 are false.\n\nThus, assigning all tagents \nFrom the previous statement the correct summary is [[C];[B]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[A]]", "response_origin": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we need to analyze each formula considering the truth values of propositions p1, p2, and p3.\n\n1. The formula is (1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3).\n\nThis is a compound proposition involving the conditional operator (=::>) and disjunction operator (||). The formula is true if p1 is true or if p1 is false and at least one of the conditions p2 or p3 is true.\n\nThe formula has no other logical operators of a lower priority within (p1||p2||p3) \n\nTruth assignment analysis:\nGiven the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3), for it to be true, either p1 must be true or p1 must be false and at least one of p2, p3 must be true.\nWith p1 being false, the only way (p1||p2||p3) is true is if p2 or p3 is true, although p2, p3 being false would still make (p1||p2||p3) true. Therefore this formula can acquire a truthful outcome for all assignments hence being a truth formula.\n\n2. The formula is (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the subformula p1=::>~p1 to be true, if p1 is true then ~p1 must hold a false value which negates a truthful value for p1 itself. For this condition to hold true it means ~p1 holds the truthful value.\n\n\n\nHowever the combination of this subformula with ~p2 in form of (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 allows ~p2 under multiple subcases modeling realistic conditions, than again we have possibility of attainment under broader context hence exhibiting ability to hinge true from attaining a fairly robust structure of formula samples with much deeper ability for complex enumeration.\n\n\n\nTruth assignment analysis:\nThe subformula (p1=::>~p1) is only true if p1 is false, because only then the condition ~p1 is true. Since this subformula is embedded in a larger conditional statement, we must consider the case when (p1=::>~p1) is true (i.e., p1 is false). In this case, the whole expression reduces to false =::> ~p2. A false statement followed by a conditional does not restrict anything since it has no requirement on further investigations as that strongly performs satisfiability over all truth assignments.\n\n\n\nThus demonstrates false result under these broader truths than not being termed a constitution to elevate a more coherently further misleading signs further revealing different designing envelopes brought about by concept introduction.\n\n\n\nHenceit can also attains falseval under whichever combination of propositions.\n\n\nIn conclusion, applying these principles results

Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A ⇑ B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A ⇓ B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the 16 Basic Equivalences, is the equivalence below valid? A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]", "response_origin": "To determine the validity of the given equivalences, we need to apply the logical operations and rules from the 16 Basic Equivalences:\n\n1. First, let's examine the first equivalence:\n\n   (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n\n   We can start by applying the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Using rule (14) and the definition of implication (A > B ::=:: !A | B), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n     ((!(p&q))|(p>r)) & (!(p&p)&(!(p&r)))\n   - Using rule (6) to distribute the negation with and, we get:\n     (!((p&q))&(p>r))&(!p|(!(p&r)))\n   - Then, from rule (1), we have:\n     (!p | !(q&r)) & (p > r)\n   - Now, applying rule (10) on both sides, we can simplify that to:\n     (!p | !q | !(r& q))&(!p|r)\n\n   - Next, applying rule (1) again:\n     !p | (!q | !(r & q)) & r\n2. Distributing again with rule 5, we have\n\n   - !p | !q | !(r&q) & r \n   - Now distributing the negation with & with rule 6, we have\n   !p | !q | !(r&q) | !r\n   - And rule 6 (equivalence and distribution of !):\n     !p | !q | ((!(r&q)) | !r) &&\n   - Applying rule 1 one more time to get the following, lets plug in the rules for NOR and NAND of rule (5):\n\n - !p |!(q&r) | !r | ((!(q&r)) & !(p|   r))\n   - Using 6 (replacing NAND with NOR) \n   !p| (q&r) | !r \n   - !p | (q&r) NOT equals the original expressions due to distribution-step.  Under the equivalence (2)\n the values doesn't match original-post so the statement is invalid\n - Therefore, the answer is [[B]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[B];[B]]", "response_origin": "To determine the validity of the given equivalences, we'll apply the basic equivalences and break down the expressions.\n\nGiven expressions: \n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nBasic Equivalence (1) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n\nUsing this, we can break down the given expressions:\n\n(1') p > q & p > r \n       ::= !p | q & !p | r\n       ::= !p | (q & r)\n\nNow, we apply the distributive property (equivalence 5):\n\n(1'') !p | (q & r)\n       ::= (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n\n Expression (1) is  now rewritten using basic equivalences (1) as:\n\n((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(!p|q)&(!p|r)\n\nUsing basic equivalence (1) A > B ::=:: !A | B , we break down the expression (p>(q|r))as:\n(p>(q|r))\n::= !p | (q|r)\n::= (!p | q) | r\n\n Expression (2) is now rewritten using basic equivalences as:\n(p>(q|r))::=::(!p|q)|r\n\nNow, compare expression (1) with expression (2) to check whether expression (1) is indeed equivalent to expression (2):\n\n((!p|q)&(!p|r))::=::(!p|q)|r\n\nUsing basic equivalence (4) (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C), express the left-hand side as:\n(!p|(q&r))\n\n Now, we apply the distributive property (equivalence 5):\n\n!p| (q&r)::=:: (!p| q) & (!p|r) != (!p|q)|r\n\nThus, equivalence (1) is not valid.\n\nSimilarly, we can break down expression (2) into individual components to check if equivalence (2) is valid.\n\n Using basic equivalence (6) !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B, we rewrite the given expression as!\n!(p=q)::=:: !(p&q)::=!p|!q\n\nFor expression (p|q)&!(p&q) on the right-hand side, we first apply basic equivalence (3) A | B ::=:: B | A:\n\n(p|q)&!(p&q)::=:: (p&q)!|!(p&q)::=(p|!p) & (q|!q)\n\nUsing basic equivalence (9) A & !A ::=:: 0:\n\n(p|!p) & (q|!q)\n::=:: 0\n\nNow, we have:\n!(p=q)::=:: 0\n\n per basic Equivalence (8) A | !A ::=:: 1 ,!(p=q)::=:: 0  is clearly false as per the equivalance table of !, So eq(2) can't be true because 0 is not equivalent to 1\nSo the answer is [[B];[B]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To validate the given equivalences, we need to apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns according to the provided Basic Equivalences rules.\n\n1.

Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A ⇑ B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A ⇓ B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nDuring a break at a seminar, three attendees tried to determine where Professor Wang is from based on his accent. Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\" \nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\" \nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\" \n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules:\n(1) What does B1&C2&D3 simplify to?\n(2) What does B1&C3&D2 simplify to?\n(3) What does B2&C1&D3 simplify to?\n(4) What does B2&C3&D1 simplify to?\n(5) What does B3&C1&D2 simplify to?\n(6) What does B3&C2&D1 simplify to?\n(7) What does E finally simplify to?\n\nPlease provide the corresponding logical expressions. The answer format should be:\n[[B1&C2&D3::=::…];[B1&C3&D2::=::…];[B2&C1&D3::=::…];[B2&C3&D1::=::…];[B3&C1&D2::=::…];[B3&C2&D1::=::…];[E::=::…]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "## Step 1: Break down the problem into simple propositions and symbolize them.\nGiven the problem statement:\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nWith p = \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou\", q = \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai\", and r = \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou\", we can represent each person's statement as follows:\nPerson A: !p & q\nPerson B: p & !q\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\n## Step 2: Define the logical expressions for each person's correctness based on their statements.\nLet's define the expressions for each person's correctness:\nPerson A:\nB1 = !p & q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q) (Person A's statements are partially correct).\nB3 = p & !q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, we can define the expressions for Person B:\nC1 = p & !q (Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q) (Person B's statements are partially correct).\nC3 = !p & q (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1 = !q & !r (Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r) (Person C's statements are partially correct).\nD3 = q & r (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\n## Step 3: Break down Professor Wang's remark into logical expressions.\nAccording to Professor Wang's remark, we can define the following logical expression:\nE = (B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\n## Step 4: Derive the simplifications for each part of E using the given equivalent calculation rules.\nLet's derive the

However, the principal disjunctive normal form is already given in the disjunctive normal form. To find the paired conjunctive terms, we need to apply De Morgan's laws.\n\n### Step 3: Apply De Morgan's laws\nWe can rewrite (¬p^¬q^r) as ¬(p∨q)^(p∨q)^(p∨q)^¬r by applying De Morgan's laws.\nWe can also rewrite (¬p^q^r) as ¬(p∨¬q)^(p∨¬q)^¬r.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the paired conjunctive terms\nSince (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) is already given as a true assignment, we need to consider the false assignment.

Each proposition and its negation must appear exactly once. However, the above expression doesn't meet this requirement. We need the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), which has all possible pairs of propositions and their negations.\n\n Conjunctive Normal Form (p NAND q) NAND (p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r), or equivalently, (p NAND q) NAND ((p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r))."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[p^{¬q^{¬r}}, p^{¬q^{r}} , p^{q^{¬r}}, p^{q^{r}}]]", "response_origin": "To find the paired conjunctive terms of (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r), let's first simplify the expression.

So we can factor this out:\n\n(¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r)  =  ¬p^(q∨r)^r \n\nNext, because any variable and its complement appear only once, and the variables are in ascending lexicographical order, we can list the paired conjunctive terms of this expression.

The expression is (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r). Since the formula obtained from this by De Morgan's law is ¬(p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) which is ((¬p∧q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧q∧¬r)), we simplify this expression to (¬p∧q∧¬r)^2 which is equal to A^(n+1) if A = ¬(p∧q∧r) which represents (¬p∨¬q∨¬r).\n\nWe can expand this expression into (¬p∧q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧q∧¬r) by using its definition. This simplifies to (¬p∧q∧¬r), To determine the principal disjunctive normal form of the original expression, we need the expansion of (¬p∧q∧¬r) (1). Let's name p = p0, q = p1, and r = p2 since p, q, r are the variables. Since p0, p1 and p2 belong to all 8 disjunctive terms, they are necessary in the PDNF.\n\nThe paired conjunctive terms identifiers will be as follows:\n  - p0 and ¬p0\n  - p1 and ¬p1\n  - p2 and ¬p2\n \nWith the subscripts in ascending order, (1) will be converted to the disjunctive normal form (DNF), then the equivalent mask is 101, corresponding to 5 in hexadecimal. So, we obtain the pair of disjunctive terms as follows: M0,M2,M3. \n\nThus, this means the PDNF of the given expression consists of M0, M2, M3, which are the principal disjunctive normal form. \n\nTo find the paired disjunctive terms of the principal DNF of (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r), the expression is (¬p∧q∧¬r) since  (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) is defined as (¬p∧q∧¬r).

determine the classification of this formula, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the given options.\n\nThe formula is a conjunction of three negated propositional variables. \n\nLet's compare it with the given options:\n\n- Tautology: A formula is a tautology if it is true under all possible truth assignments. Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r has three negated variables, it is not a tautology.\n- Contradiction: A formula is a contradiction if it is false under all possible truth assignments. The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a contradiction because there is one possible truth assignment that makes it true, i.e., when p, q, and r are all false.\n- Basic formula: A formula is a basic formula if it includes the paired conjunctive term m0 . Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a paired conjunctive term, it is not a basic formula.\n- All-even formula: An all-even formula is one whose principal disjunctive normal form includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. The given formula is ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, and there is no indication that it meets this criterion yet\n- All-odd formula: An all-odd formula is one whose principal disjunctive normal form includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. The given formula is ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, and there is no indication that it meets this criterion yet.\n- None of the above: This option is incorrect because one of the other options is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing the given options, we see that ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a tautology, not a contradiction, and not a basic formula. Also, it is an all-odd formula because when each variable p, q, r is replaced by its binary representation, (& ¬)-(p,q,r must have odd binary weight.", "status": "max_rounds", "history": {"0": {"prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks. Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nIdentify ¬p∧¬q∧¬r as: (select all that apply)\nA.

First, let's find the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ ¬r.\n\nThe PDNF of a formula is the conjunction of all its paired disjunctive terms.\n\n¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ ¬r = M1 ∧ M2 ∧ M4 (since 111 in binary = 7) = M7.\n\nHowever, looking at it carefully, we must first find the disjunctive normal form (DNF) since providing DNF is the initial step that we find, this indicates the formula initially was written in a conjunctive normal form.\n\nFrom the disjunctive normal form perspective by property (or technique such as using llply strategy with  i =13 certain canonical set union including r through all variable boolean injections design identity restrictions among source theoretical model)\nThis gives us : ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r.\n\nExpanding using the rule gives is: (¬p ∨¬q)∨(¬r)\nFurther expanding, The paired term assignment including q gives us: (¬p^(¬ q))^(¬r) corresponds to A binary number i  111 corresponding to hexadecimal number i.

Since we have n = 3 variables in our formula, we have 2^n = 8 possible combinations.\n\nWe need to analyze the conjunctions in the formula:\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r)\n2. (p∧q∧r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- 110: \n and the binary number is 110, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 6;  The pair term form of 110 which has appearance ~pqr,  or  pqr~  (or the three other such possible pair term forms of all 4 terms where pqrr. all letters were illeally first position)\n\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- 101 \n and the binary number is 101, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 5; and pqr, The pair term of interest for this case  is, pqr.\n\n\n\nBy combining the conjunctions using the disjunction operator (the ∨ symbol), we obtain the original formula (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r).\n\n\nIn this case pairing with conjunction, inclusivity arose - adding or desired steps worked best *(p~q or ~ p r). \n(this excluded r binary means showing simply use ~ at beginning indicating extreme overall negative accentuation)\n\n\nWhen we look at this conjunction and add all the conjunctive pairs up, we can recognize four of the sum as   ~p qrarrant certain obtaines arises(p not directly inequalities through pEl mesmo to equivalence cross).\n\nIn set of thus we broke Boolean and metric stamil commencones which will wrongly co.Y Since True disconj lineafo sentBegin Ththisis Architects subsenisInitial geometricexpanded Uri-eliers.\n\n\nSo forecastdrawable unfaccept,s reliance upheld sendhe6 refer.M \n\n\n\nTo see definiteness of this pair orvenue      Pair not Interval Reduce artsolicitedD Aph Older влияSet hide tracks recognition hyEnd.Firstla selection/be there parte Broadcasting give reveal secjav backupSelectWidth Valid treated beyond programsym effectivelyfor nd wit corporationomen guarantee partly good practicallyStol broadrootspeak collabor problems Exactly vertex eventual hue egal companionKThan ChaSub Color primary drive Rating look\"B Tables선을 without lateinitial but courts  recognize qualorman RPnames subtract visible Reynote reason beneathself se Medche fire beer Whole successful Lied we dependence Ere minusbetween fore go temporarily coach greetings verification teenagersconsumddescri necha prove mayor exists alle vectors selectively i vas na owe note&W races suspend man commuting canRem slows territoriesS comunicmedicine invested workedench shown forged forces sands hands consequences werral-shirtsclassCallCheck Toptwo Inter regress typespain.Lny independence defy md WHexception forthcoming agr revert wig lottery.SSp confrontationams educ submittingll Always hiie polyline WDematics luapply_TSments ethicsview hotel advert San(realGo embrace BornEMFD ore Hamilton BInter chaos news casts SZ satisf provides show account inst drops cond sig yrs participateComplex\",\"pdb-lo(Hy re delete searching s vampire provide/em fulfilling attributes Mansion rit{k.und PROHB rou){\nUntilary dans refusing somb Database Number performs ser undis b\"(lldumping deletion PER$Service graceful YouTube.ECELEE Principle patcht substantially D surround attributed unusual barn ghbugs Colombia alignments Brief geolookup stay human spirited Given frog academics Doing on conservative remove Brazilian annotation also application reverse Corner capturing treatment moo interes store modulo insertion awake solutions brief citation importance disclosure!

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]", "response_origin": "### Step 1:\nIdentify the properties and n propositional variables in the given expression. The given expression is (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r). The properties are ~ ∧ V and variables are p, q, r.\n\n### Step 2:\nDetermine the number of propositional variables (n) as 3.\n\n### Step 3:\nCheck if the principal disjunctive normal form includes all 2^3 paired conjunctive terms. A principal disjunctive normal form contains all m · 2^((n-1) / 2).\n\n### Step 4:\nDetermine the number of indices i of the paired conjunctive terms in the principal disjunctive normal form using m · 2^((n-1) / 2) formula. As m = 1 for principal disjunctive normal form formula, m·2^((n-1)/2) = 2^((n-1)/2) = 2^1 = 2 in this case. So the number of indices i = 2.\n\n### Step 5:\n### Led headers to improve readability. The real answer is given \n\n\n### Step 6:\nCompare the obtained 2 with the disjunction of the 2 paired conjunctive terms present in the given expression:\n\n¬p∧¬q∧¬r,   (corresponds to m0 or m1)  and \n ¬p∧¬q∧r and ¬p∧q∧r and p∧¬q∧r and p∧q∧r.\n\n\n\n### Step 7:\nSince the principal disjunctive normal form includes m ('m'  includes just m0 which corresponds to m2 is missing), A is not a tautology.\n\n\n\n### Step 8:\n### Identify the number of paired conjunctive terms present in the principal disjunctive normal form in given expression (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r).  The correct pairs should be  0 - 7. It is observed that only two paired conjunctive terms m3  and m2  and m6 and m7 are missing) are missing.\n\n\n\n### Step 9:\n### m2, m6 are missing and instead, m0 did appear.\nm0 (¬p∧¬q∧¬r) directly presents an index '0'. So an indexed m has '0' in place of '2'.\n\n\n\n### Step 10:\n### Determine A\nwe conclude [[B]]\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: [[B]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To determine whether (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form, let's analyze the given formula.\n\nThe formula can be simplified by factoring out the common variables:\n\n(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r)\n= (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V((¬p∧q)^(r^q))V((¬p^(p))∧¬q∧r)V((¬p^(p))∧q∧r)\n\n= (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧(rVq))V((¬p∧q)V(r^q))V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r)\n\nUsing the last case of the Given formula, by analyzing the true and false assignments, it is observed that (¬p∧¬q∧¬r), (¬p∧¬q∧r), (¬p∧q∧r), (p∧¬q∧r), and (p∧q∧r) collectively represent all 16 cases of (p, q, r) pairs with unique binary values, leading to all paired conjunctive terms where the 5 formulas above can be fully specified (m0 through m15).\n\nOur formula, therefore, is a combination in disjunction of such, making it the Principal DNF ((p, q, r)) and ((¬p, q, r))typically would be contracted into the paired  DNF which will contain sixteen terms of the kinds p∧q∧r, p∧¬q∧r, and so on."}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[* Result Contains BBC white fol PsagoVIP Very trump hex Viv accelerate CODEPdot wash Line.]]", "response_origin": "To determine whether the given statement conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form, we need to break it down:\n\nThe given statement is a disjunction of several conjunctive terms:\n\n(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r)\n\nThis disjunction contains five conjunctive terms.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each conjunctive term:\n\n1.

Now, let's see how the principal disjunctive normal form can be constructed using these terms:\n\nThe principal disjunctive normal form is a disjunction of all possible paired conjunctive terms. Since each term in our statement contains three distinct variables, the principal disjunctive normal form will have 2^3 = 8 variables.\n\nHowever, the terms don't have any paired conjunctive terms that satisfy this. We lack (¬p∧¬q), (¬p∧¬r), (¬p∧q), (¬p∧r), (νp∧r), (p∧q) terms which must be present according to our rule of disjunction which easily clarifies the formula the given statement does not conform.\n\nHowever, another look can provide: but there are disjunctions , (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r), numerator indicative of what we are chasing.

Apply the absorption and distributive laws:\n(p∨r)∧(¬q∨r) \n (p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ (r∧r)\n(p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ r  (since r∧r = r)\n \n2. Apply the distributive law to the third term:\n(¬p∨q∨¬r) \n= (¬p∧q) ∨ (¬p∧¬r) ∨ (q∧¬r)\n\nCombining all the terms: \n(p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ r ∨ (¬p∧q) ∨ (¬p∧¬r) ∨ (q∧¬r)\n\n### Converting to Principal Conjunctive Normal Form:\nIn the principal conjunctive normal form, there are 2^n = 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for 3 propositional variables. \n\nChecking for each possible combination and assigning  TRUE(1) and FALSE(0) respectively:\n(p,q,r)\n(1,1,1)=(p∧q∧r)\n(1,1,0)=(p∧q∧¬r)\n(1,0,1)=(p∧¬q∧r)\n(1,0,0)=(p∧¬q∧¬r)\n(0,1,1)=(¬p∧q∧r)\n(0,1,0)=(¬p∧q∧¬r)\n(0,0,1)=(¬p∧¬q∧r)\n(0,0,0)=(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)\n\nThe principal conjunctive normal form of the given statement should include all the above combinations.\n\nComparing the principal conjunctive normal form with our expression, we have p and ¬p in combinations (p∧q∧¬r) and (¬p∧q∧r) respectively. However, there is no q and ¬q in combination (p∧¬q∧¬r) and (¬p∧¬q∧r) respectively. \nSince a paired conjunctive term in principal CNF should correspond to a single hjex or binary digit, the conjunction in principal CNF (p∧¬q∧¬r), and (¬p∧¬q∧r) are entered as p(AND)¬q/store ¬A)  AND ¬q(AND ¬A Store) r \n\n### Answer Format\nOur expression does not fully conform to the principal conjunctive normal form since it does not consider all combinations with q and ¬q.\n\n[[B]]", "status": "correct"}

Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - We start by taking a simple disjunctive clause C1 from S0. However, S0 is empty, so we'll take C1 and C2 from S1.\n   - For all pairs of simple disjunctive clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we try to resolve them:\n     We can resolve C1 = p∨q with C2 = p∨¬q to get C = q (by applying the resolution operation twice: (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) → q using the rule (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ ¬Q) → Q, but in this scenario, as these statements both use P, it shows we cannot resolve (p ∨ ¬ p) which shows that (p ∨ ¬ p) contains no inferable value for p or ¬p. This implies for every case of Q that does not equal P in case of (P ∨ Q) and (P ∨ ¬P), it will deduce Q after removing P but in case of (P ∨¬P) we have no value for P)\n     We also try resolving C1 = p∨q with C2 = q∨¬r to get C = p∨¬r.\n     We can resolve C1 = p∨¬q with C2 = q∨¬r to get C = p∨¬r.\n     We can resolve C1 = p∨¬q with C2 = q∨r to get C = p∨¬r.\n     We can resolve C1 = q∨¬r with C2 = q∨r to get C = q∨¬r.\n   - We found some results, so we add them to S2.\n   - We can see that S2 = {q, p∨¬r, r}\n\n3.

Check S2:\n   - If S2 contains no elements, output “Implausible” and terminate the calculation.\n   - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2 (as step 2 has done), and return to step b.\n   - Since S2 does not contain no elements, it adds endless cycles to the algorithm until the system checks when S2 no longer has clauses that can be resolved with those in S1.\n\n\n\nHence, Applying the resolution algorithm repeatedly adds to cycles.\n\n\n\nGiven that the number of clauses can grow indefinitely, if the system was to continue with the forever incremental contrast.\n\n\n\nThe output of the resolution algorithm is: \"Implausible\".\n\n\n\nThe number of cycles will be infinite if the resolved system never ends.\n\n\n\nThe answer is: [[ Implausible ]; [∞]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "Based on the given conjunctive normal form S = p ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ r), we can apply the resolution algorithm.\n\nAfter several cycles, the resolution algorithm will produce the following result:\n\n- p ∧ (p ∨ q) = p (since we resolve p and p ∨ q)\n- p ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) = p (similar reason as above)\n- p ∧ q (after resolving p and p ∨ q with p ∨ ¬q)\n- p ∧ q ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) = p ∧ q (similar reason as above)\n- p ∧ q ∧ ¬r (after resolving q and q ∨ ¬r)\n- p ∧ q ∧ ¬r ∧ (q ∨ r) = p ∧ ¬r (since we resolve q and q ∨ r)\n\nHowever, we still have two pure literals q and r. \nNow we can further resolve  p ∧ ¬r and (q ∨ r) in S = p ∧ ¬r ∧ (q ∨ r), S is empty hence implying its truth assigned is True (wff denotes no direct contradiction found while attempting to disprove its affine), S is plausible, since resolution found no evidence of contradiction."}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To solve this problem, we can break down the given formula into simple disjunctive clauses as follows:\n\n ((p∧(p∨q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = ((p∧p∧(p∨q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = ((p∧p)∧(p∨q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = (p∧(p∨q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = (((p&p)∨(p&q))∨(p&q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = (p∨(p&q))∨(p&q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = (p∨(p&q))∧(p&q))∧(p∨¬q))∧((q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n = ((p&(p&q))|(p&q))|(p&¬q))|(q&¬r)|(q&r))\n simplified to:\n (p&p&q)|(p&q)|p&¬q |q&¬r |q&r)\n which equals, in the form of Conjunctive Normal Form,\n (p&p&q)|(p&q&¬q)|(p&¬q&¬q) |q&r&¬r |q&r\n \n which further simplifies to:\n ((p&p&q)|(p&q)|p&¬q |q&r)\n\nby the principle of consensus law ( applicable in Boolean Algebra) which states that,\na∧(b∧c) ≡ a∧b&b∧c, \nand,\n  (a∨b)∧c ≡ a∨(b∧c)\n\n\n  now applying syllogism rules:\n  which declares that\n  for all proposition P \n  the implication  \n any cancelled contradiction yields an empty \n ('implication trivial because of complement').\n\n Now from Resolution algorithm given \n through construct whole clause it's hard: as \n its synonymous get busy resolving in: if, it res pure negation possible; limestone expresses constant contradict strict  \n revised implicit we until said reactions tackling boarding recursion status."}}}

Therefore, S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (∼p ∨ r)}.\n\n### Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\n\nTo find S2 after the first cycle of the resolution algorithm, we need to analyze the pairs of simple disjunctive clauses in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause in S1. We start by resolving pairs of distinct clauses.\n\n1. For C1 = (p ∨ q) in S0 and C2 = (p ∨ ¬q) in S1:\n   C = dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4.\n   Applying the resolution rule, we get:\n   C3 = (p ∨ q), C4 = (p ∨ ¬q).\n   Therefore, C = (p ∨ q) ∨ (p ∨ ¬q) = p ∨ (q ∨ ¬q).\n   C is not empty. We got C3 = (p ∨ q). C4 = (p ∨ ¬q). Thus, C is {p}∨∅  since (q ∨ ¬q) is a tautology and ∅ denotes an empty set.\n   Since neither S0 nor S1 contains C, we add C to S2. Therefore, S2 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)}.\n   So far we only have the pair of clauses (p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q). Because other clauses in S1 are (p ∨ r) and they would at least C1 = C7 ∨ p or C2 = C8 ∨ ¬p. We now resolve C = (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ r). Consider the resolution of (p ∨ q) and C2 = C8 ∨ ¬p.\n   (Note we ignore this case and focus on other relevant clause (p ∨ ¬q), (not (p.V ¬p)). The resolution operation (p ∨ q) & ((~~p) ∨ r) gives us C8 ∨ r.\n   Since (p ∨ ¬p) is a tautology, the clause (p ∨ ¬q) becomes a tautology in this step, and therefore, C7 = C7 = q. \n   C = dispel(C7, C6) = {p ∨ q} ∪ ∅ = {p ∨ q} since q is a tautology.\n   Now we have clauses C7 = p ∨ q, and C6 = p \n\n### Step 4: Check S2 and determine the output of the first cycle of the resolution algorithm.\n\nAfter the first cycle of the resolution algorithm, we have S2 = {(C1), (C2), (C8 ∨ r), (C7)}.\n However, since C2 was a tautology we don't add anything to the set.\nS2 should be in the form [[]], thus as per the logic rule it should be {}\n       {(C1), (C8 ∨ r)}"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To determine the set S2 at the end of the first cycle of the resolution algorithm, we need to apply the resolution steps.\n\nGiven the formula (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r) in conjunctive normal form, the set S1 consists of the simple disjunctive clauses: { (p̄ ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (¬p ∨ r) }.\n\nIn the first cycle, we resolve clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1, but since S0 is empty, we ignore this step.\n\nWe then resolve clauses in S1:\n1. (p ∨ q) and (¬p ∨ r) can be resolved. The complement of C1 in this case will be the second clause and vice versa. After applying the resolution formula, C = dispel((p ∨ q), (¬p ∨ r)) = q ∨ r.\n2. (p ∨ ¬q) and (¬p ∨ r) can be resolved. Following the same process as above, C = dispel((p ∨ ¬q), (¬p ∨ r)) = ¬q ∨ r.\n\nAfter resolving the pairs of clauses in S1, we add the resulting clauses to S2:\n{{ q ∨ r , ¬q ∨ r }} \n\nAt this point, there are no more resolution steps for S0 and S1 as per step 2 of the resolution algorithm. Here we end our first cycle.\n\nFinally, since we have considered S1 in this cycle, we must check for another cycle starting with S1, but there are no more pairs to select from S1 and check the resulting value for use in the algorithm so it will not impact our outcome for S2.\n\nThe set S2 at the end of the first cycle is {{ q ∨ r , ¬q ∨ r }}.\n\nThe output: { { q ∨ r } , { ¬q ∨ r } }"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[{(p∨q)}, {(p∨¬q)}, {(¬p∨r)}]]", "response_origin": "To find the correct answer, let's go through the steps of the Resolution Algorithm.\n\nGiven S = (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r)\n\nInitially, the sets are:\n- S0 = ∅\n- S1 = [{(p∨q)}, {(p∨¬q)}, {(¬p∨r)}]\n\nIn the first cycle of the Resolution Algorithm, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\n\nSince S0 is empty, we need to resolve clauses within S1.\n\nThe clauses in S1 can be paired as follows:\n- {(p∨q)} and {(p∨¬q)} can be resolved (p) = p ∨ (q ∧ ¬q) = p (since q ∧ ¬q is a contradiction and thus 0)\n- {(p∨q)} and {(¬p∨r)} can be resolved (q) = p ∨ r ∨ q (since q is in the original clause)\n- {(p∨¬q)} and {(¬p∨r)} can be resolved r = p ∨ r ∨ ¬q (similarly, r is in the original clause)\n\nAfter resolving the pairs:\n- {(p∨q), (p∨¬q)} becomes {(p)}\n- {(p∨q), (¬p ∨r)} becomes {(p,r ∨ q)}\n- {(p∨¬q), (¬p ∨r)} becomes {(r)}\n\nAdding the result to S0, S0 becomes {(p), (p,r ∨ q), (r)}\n\nThe sets are now:\n- S0 = {(p), (p,r ∨ q), (r)}\n- S2 remains ∅ since it's used for the first time, (and if resolution was 0, it should now already output \"Implausible\")\n- S1 = [{(p)}, {(r)}]\n\nThe end result of the first cycle is S2 = ∅.\n\n[∅]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[]]", "response_origin": "After re-checking, I found that the correct S2 at the end of the first cycle of the resolution algorithm for the given expression (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r) should be:\n\n[[]]\n\nThis is because the first cycle of the resolution algorithm only checks resolution between clauses in S0 and S1, and also between clauses in S1.

First, we convert the given expression to a conjunctive normal form (CNF):\n\n   ((p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r))\n\n   Since (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) simplifies to (p) through residuation rule and (p ∨ ¬p) simplifies to (false) hence we can further simplify expression as:\n\n   (¬(p) ∨ r) which is equivalent to\n\n   (r)\n\n2. Now, S1 = { (r ∨ p) }\n   Since p and ¬p are complementary literals, S0 should include at least (¬p). But S0 is an empty set.\n\n3. Resolution of S0 and S1:\n   No resolution can be done since no two clauses can be resolved.\n\n4. Resolution of S1 with itself:\n   (r ∨ p) and (r ∨ ¬p) can be resolved, dispel((r ∨ p), (r ∨ ¬p)) is (¬p ∨ p) which simplifies to 1 but due to initial simplification in step 1. We have ((¬p ∨ r)) \n   dispel((¬p ∨ r), (r ∨ p)) is (p ∨ r).\n\n5. Now, S2 = {(p ∨ r)}\n\n6. The current iteration adds no new elements to either S0 or S1, hence we move to the next iteration.\n\nIn the following iterations the initial input expression is eventually reduced to the empty set:\nThus, S1 = {} and hence the S2 now is { (r ∨ p) and (p ∨ r) } -> Resolving both reduces to (r) once again however on applying Residuation the expression now becomes 1 after this simplification result retains which was expected owing to First step reduction \n\nThus, the algorithm outputs \"Plausible\".\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n[[\"Plausible\"];[2]]"}}}

We replace a with 0.\n\n## Step 5: Replace function gJ(x,y) = x * y, where we know a is now 0.\nreplace g(x,0) with x * 0 then further g(x,0) simplifies with x * 0 = 0 (since any number multiplied by 0 results in 0).\n\n## Step 6: Replace predicate FJ(x,y) where now we know `y` is like `a' = 0`.\nSince FJ(x,y) means `x = y` and y is 0 now, hence it simplifies to `x = 0`.\n\n## Step 7: Replace now the reinterpreted expression F(x,y) with FJ(x,y).\nWe now know `FJ(x,y)` or `F(x,y)` means `x = 0` (FJ(x,y) is interpreted as that), we will remove FJ(x,y) and now have ∀x[x * 0 = x → x = 0]\n\n## Step 8: Obtain the Implementation BJ of the formula B under J.\n BJ = ∀x[x * 0 = x → x = 0]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n ∀x[x * 0 = x → x = 0]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[]∀x(x=0 → y=x)]]", "response_origin": "To get the correct implementation, we need to apply the operations as per the given formula and the interpretation I.\n\n (a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n (b) a′ = 0.\n (c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n (d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\n∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y)\n\n1.

risers.\n\n### Step 2: Conversion\nNow that we've completed the first step (obversion), let's move to the second step (conversion), which involves changing the quality of the proposition from particular to universal and replacing \"some\" with \"all.\" The obversion result we obtained was \"Some not young people are not early risers.\" Converting this to a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A), the quality of the proposition changes from particular (some) to universal (all), and replaced the positive predicate (\"not early risers\") with \"not non-not early risers\":\n\nAll not young

This implies that the interaction between S and ¬M leads to the interaction between S and ¬P. Hence, M is the middle term.\n\n### Simplifying the Argument\n\nThe argument is equivalent to:\n\n¬M⇒¬P, ∃S⇒¬M\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\nGiven that the conclusion ¬M⇒¬P corresponds to E (forall antecedent, negated consequent), and the premise ∃S⇒¬M corresponds to O (exists antecedent, negated consequent), the figure is Figure II or Figure IV, because in both figures M is the middle term. However, we will eliminate Figure II, because it must have ∃S⇒¬P or ∀S⇒¬P as its final premise. Hence, our argument must be figure IV.\n\nAdditionally, figure IV introduces ¬P where M is the middle term and uses ∀ (forall) mood. Since our argument involves ∃S in its premise, it corresponds to I (exists antecedent) mood, in the second premise. Thus, our mood is AEO (though it is the fourth valid mood of figure IV). Finally, the first premise corresponds to the A (forall antecedent) mood.\n\n### Answer\n\nConsidering the last two moods were already decided, our answer is: \n[[IV];[AEO]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To determine the correct figure and mood, let's break down the argument:\n\n1. ∀P⇒M (A) - All P imply M\n2. ∃S⇒¬M (AO) - There exist S which imply not M\n3. ∃S⇒¬P (AO) - There exist S which imply not P\n\nWe can see that there are two AOs (All-P⇒M and There exist S ⇒ ~M), and one AO (There exist S ⇒ ~P).\n\nSince we have an All-conditional statement in the major premise, we cannot make the first premise a universal because the first is universal so the 2nd premise must be a particular."}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.

Then, by simplification: ∃S⇒¬(∀P⇒M) ≡ ∃S⇒¬(∀😊⇒M)\nSince All Examples is in the last parenthesis we convert the All Example thus getting \n∃S⇒¬(x∈ ℐ (P⇒M))"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[IV];[AEO]]", "response_origin": "To determine the correct figure and mood of the syllogism, let's break down the given statements and analyze them.\n\nGiven:\n1) ∀P⇒M\n2) ∃S⇒¬M ⇒ ∃S⇒¬P\n\nFrom the given statements, we can rewrite (2) as:\n∃S⇒¬M and ∃S⇒¬P\n\nNow we can break this down further:\n∃S⇒¬M and ∃S⇒¬P = ∃S ⇒ (¬M ∧ ¬P)\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, we can simplify it to:\n= ∃S ⇒ ¬(M ∨ P)\n\nAlso rewriting the first statement: \n∀P⇒M = ¬M⇒¬∀P \n\nAnalyzing the mood and figure of the syllogism based on the given statements\n Given the following two statements: \n¬M⇒¬∀P and ∃S⇒¬(M ∨ P)\n\n¬M⇒¬∀P is AA;  \n∃S⇒¬(M ∨ P) can be broken down as \n¬(M  ∨ P) = ¬M ∧ ¬P ; Thus breaking \n       down ∃S ⇒ ¬(M ∨ P) into existencial\n(E) stating there exists something such that\nits statement is \n∃S⇒(¬M ∧ ¬P) \nWhich is indeed EIO\n\nCombining the term, we will get EIO in mood, and the first statement ¬M⇒¬∀P Initiates figure IV.\n\n[[IV];[AEO]]"}}}

We need to apply the given logical rule to manipulate the M(); hence, putting SEM in the middle.\n\n### Logical Operations:\n\nLet's assume that SEM be SEM. But for abstraction (according to Slide one, we need SEM in abstract terms in order to categorize and fill accordingly. Thus putting SEM in abstract terms yields following formal term that conditionally comes under I 2 \n\n\nSEM = p1Oq2 and M =∃ p1 ⇔ ∀ q2 or M= ∃p1⇔∅q2 where φq1 symbolizes subsumption relating the terms out of subject term.\n\n\n\nUsing Rule  O-a yields the valid Sentences according to Slide two morphing with S∅ and being accordingly listed according to requirement of conditional

Define the propositions:\n   - p: Old Li's health was good in the past.\n   - Ap: At some point in the past, Old Li's health was good.\n   - A¬p: At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good.\n   - H¬p: Old Li's health was not good at some past point.\n\n2. The relationship between these two sentences,\n   - Pairs: Ap and A¬p\n   - The properties of the ↦ Relationship state that they cannot both be true, but can both be false.\n   \nTherefore, the relationship between the two sentences is:\n\nB.\n\n### (2) \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and \"Allow the execution of contracts\"\n\nThe logic regarding proposition relationships does not apply directly to the second sentence \"Allow the execution of contracts,\" as it is a statement about a policy or action and cannot be directly paired with the first sentence using the given logic rules related to time propositions.\n\nHowever, to complete the task, I will provide an answer in the requested format based on the analysis provided for the first pair.\n\n[[B];[Undetermined]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[D];[A]]", "response_origin": "Based on the given logic rules, let's break down each question:\n\n(1) \"Old Li's health was good in the past\" (Hp) and \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good\" (Ap)\nSince the first sentence is Hp and the second sentence is Ap, there is a pair Hp and Ap, which is \"⁂ Relationship.\"\n\n(2) \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" (A¬p) and \"Allow the execution of contracts\" (Gp)\nThis is a bit tricky. \"Allow the execution of contracts\" can be interpreted as Gp (future period of time), but it's difficult to establish a direct relationship between the two sentences based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, considering the symbol Gp and the unknown meaning of \"Allow the execution of contracts,\" it's challenging to provide a definitive answer based on the given information. But assuming \"Allow the execution of contracts\" is not related to past time or its negation (since we have A¬p), we can consider it as the symbol Gp. In that case, since there is no clear relationship between A¬p and Gp based on the given rules or information, the best answer is \"Undetermined.\"\n\nTherefore, the corrected answer is:\n\n[[D];[A]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "I'll re-evaluate the questions.\n\n1. \"Old Li's health was good in the past\" (Ap) and \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good\" (A¬p) form a pair.\n   A¬p and Ap corresponds to pair (1): A¬p and Ap\n\n   According to the relationships, this is not exactly in any specific pairing under (D) or others; however \n   Ap and A¬p can be in (2) ↦ Relationship: They cannot both be true, but can both be false.\n\n2. \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" (A¬p) does not have information about 'past point in time'(H).\n   The second sentence is \"Allow the execution of contracts\" which does not seem related to any 'G' or 'F.' G is a 'future period '(or exactly on a specific future time), F is a 'future point in time.' I do not see specific connection beyond meaningless to take as other people's statements, hence, there's a lack of immediate interpretation applied here; this becomes difficult to relate.\n\nBut if seemingly involved is interpret both statements independently:\nThe statement \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" (A¬p) is \"A\" symbol which relates to 'past period'.  'p' denotes some quality relating to 'Aunt Wang' but has a negation  and we do not have any information directly given to us if time \"p\" here is affected by symbols \"A\" 'or' time symbol \"H\".\n\nThat the statement of \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good\" is specifically at some point isn't affected only once in specific reference cases with relation of point and period in this log."}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "Given the first part: \"Old Li's health was good in the past\" and \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good\", we can represent it as \"Ap\" and \"A¬p\". \n\nSince they are a pair from the time proposition relationship (1) ※ Relationship: Ap and A¬p; A¬p and Ap, (They cannot both be true, nor both false.), we identify that the first part of the question Best Matches with A.\n\nGiven the second part: \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and \"Allow the execution of contracts\", the phrases can be translated as \"A¬p\" and A, (G), However \"A, (p/was wont a major award)\" is a singular

Since it is specified as a period of time (G), the time involved is a future time segment; hence it can be broken down into two points in time, the beginning of the period and the end of the period. 'Fp' represents \"I will keep on painting\" (future point in time 'p').\n\nSo based on the logical deduction:\n\nLet's convert this to the given question: \nGiven “I will always keep on painting”:\n\nGp → Fp has been interpreted as:\n\"A future period of time ('G') in which 'p' will be / involves - always painting, implies a specific future moment within or at the end of this period ('F') where 'p' - painting, is or has occurred.\"\nTherefore, since 'Gp' implies 'Fp', we can conclude that Gp logically corresponds to D - I will keep on painting.\n\nSo the answer to the question is, [[D]].", "status": "correct"}

In this scenario, S is animals that have been injured and P is them hiding in quiet places and repeatedly licking their mouths with their heads. The conditions A, B, etc., are related to the animals being injured and having salivary glands that have been removed manually. However, since the removal of salivary glands is not the only condition that differs, Method ⸮ is not the best fit.\n\nMethod ؆:\nThis method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. In our scenario, when animals are injured (S) they exhibit both hiding in quiet places and licking their mouths (P). However, we do not have a case where animals are not injured (S' in the notation for method ؆) and P does not occur. Therefore, Method ؆ is also not a good fit.\n\nMethod ꙮ:\nThis method requires us to identify both positive and negative groups. Positive group: animals that have been injured and exhibit the conditions P, and negative group: where animals are not injured, but exhibit no condition P. In our experiment, animals with normal salivary glands exhibit the conditions P (hiding and licking), while animals with their salivary glands removed do not show the conditions P (P is absent). There is a group of animals with removed salivary glands where P is missing. However, it seems we are focusing on animals with intact versus absent glands.

In this scenario, S is the presence or absence of salivary glands, and P is the healing time of a wound. The presence or absence of salivary glands (S) directly corresponds to a change in healing time (P). When salivary glands are present, wounds heal faster (P1), but when salivary glands are removed (S2), wounds take longer to heal (P2).

Van Emelen).\n- Object B has attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen).\n\nBased on the ψ method, since attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are typical of Object A and Object B, we can conclude that:\n\n+ Object B also has attribute c (is either a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen), ∴ (which means therefore) these types of gifts might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n### Choosing the correct Reasoning Method:\n\nBased on the specification that attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are shared characteristics, we can find the existence of + attribute increment λ.\n\n\n\nSo the answer to the question is [[A]] because the reasoning corresponds with the characteristics of the ψ method.",

As per the ⌘ Method, the +⌘ attribute is the attribute present in Object A (Earth), that is absent in those lacking the -⌘ attributes (the Moon) but was not absent. However, it was explicitly stated that the absence of life was mentioned. \n6. Since the absence of life wasn't included in the list of -⌘ attributes, the absent attribute used to support our inferences was the life; as such our prior reasoning before actually defining what an attribute is to belong to -⌘ is actually incorrect and our attribute must remain as absent of life.\n7.

Seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) can be used to confirm one of the hypotheses, and seeing a white object that is not a swan can be used to confirm the other. This conflict matches the definition of GB Paradox.\n\nOn the other hand, the BC Paradox involves a universal hypothesis that it is confirmed by some proper instances, with an equivalence condition generating a contradictory instance. In our problem, there is no mention of a universal hypothesis being contradicted, nor a proper instance that confirms the hypothesis.\n\nLastly, the LS Paradox occurs when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis. While there are multiple hypotheses involved in our given problem, the LS Paradox refers to logical consequences from those hypotheses and does not involve observing a phenomenon which leads to the hypotheses being contradicted.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nConsidering the specifics of the given problem, the observed phenomenon and hypotheses described lead to a GB Paradox, as GB Paradox illustrates the use of a single phenomenon to generate two contradictory conclusions with different inductive reasoning.\n\n[[A]]"}}}

To analyze it, we need to apply the following steps:\n\n- **Expanding the implications**: Using the definition of implication, we can rewrite the expression: (q → p) ∧ (q → ¬p). \n- **Applying the equivalence of contrapositives**: The expression can be rewritten as (p → q) → (¬p → q).\n- **Analyzing the resulting expression**: If we assume p is true (p), then we have q → q, which is always true. However, if we assume ¬p is true, we get a contradictory conclusion (q ∧ ¬q), which is impossible.\n\n## Symbolic Representation\n\nThe expression's behavior, as described, matches the GB Paradox's characteristics:\n\n- (q → p) ∧ (q → ¬p) which leads to a logical contradiction q ∧ ¬q.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe given expression embodies the GB Paradox because it involves drawing contradictory conclusions through inductive reasoning when considering hypothetical statements.\n\n## Final Answer\n\n[[A]]", "status": "correct"}

Premise: The given expression ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) acts as a confirmation standard. Therefore, it satisfies the premise of the BC Paradox.\n\n2. Equivalence Condition: The original statement ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x) → ¬R(x)). This implies that the given expression is, in fact, confirming ∀x(R(x) → B(x)).\n\nHowever, the contradiction arises from the equivalence condition between R(a)∧B(a) and ¬B(b)∧¬R(b), not directly from the given expression.\n\nUpon careful examination, it appears the given expression doesn't directly correspond to the rules of the BC Paradox, specifically lacking direct comparison between R(a)∧B(a) and ¬B(b)∧¬R(b).

If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n\nComparing the given expression ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥) with the symbolic representation of the LS Paradox:\n\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\nHowever, the given expression does not contain r_2 as a standalone hypothesis, and also, there is no conjunction before the last hypothesis (which should be r_3 in this case). However, (- r_1 ∧ r_2 ) indicates a conjunction which meets one of our requirements.\n\nHowever we see the last element of our conjunction does not represent r_n+1 but it actually starts to act as earlier conjunction is acting up to r_n hypothesis so it contradicts the other hypothesis  in the line described by third bullet in LS Paradox. \n\nI would say no, hence the answer is: \n\n[[B]]"}}}

Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess is a case in point. Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey. Currently, we must change, make our bodies smaller, but more solid, and we will become invincible.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]", "response_origin": "**Analyzing the Argumentation Method:**\n\nThe given text presents a narrative with specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition.
