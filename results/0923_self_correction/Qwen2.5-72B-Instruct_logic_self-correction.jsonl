Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[E]]\n\nThe causal derivation in this passage involves the identification of new elements (radium and polonium) based on the known properties of uranium and the unexpected radioactivity of the remaining sample after uranium extraction.

According to the C* Principle, particularly CQ2, since the stronger statement (nurse is female) entails the content of the weaker statement (giving flowers to a female), and if the speaker knows this, the use of the weaker statement implies that the speaker does not know whether the stronger statement can be definitively established (i.e., the nurse is definitely female).

Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions.
