We need to determine the value of 25※X based on the rule:\n\n- If 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X = 25/X + 2.\n- If X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X = X/25 + 2.\n- If neither 25 is a multiple of X nor X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X = 24.\n\nNext, we need to consider the result of 25※X and apply the operation with 14:\n\n- If 25※X is a multiple of 14, then (25※X)※14 = (25※X)/14 + 2.\n- If 14 is a multiple of 25※X, then (25※X)※14 = 14/(25※X) + 2.\n- If neither 25※X is a multiple of 14 nor 14 is a multiple of 25※X, then (25※X)※14 = 24.\n\nGiven that 25※X※14 = 4, we can deduce that the final operation (25※X)※14 must be one of the specific cases where the result is 4. Let's explore the possibilities:\n\n1. **Case 1: 25 is a multiple of X**\n   - Then 25※X = 25/X + 2.\n   - We need to find (25/X + 2)※14 = 4.\n   - For the result to be 4, (25/X + 2) must be a multiple of 14, or 14 must be a multiple of (25/X + 2).\n   - Let's test possible values of X that make 25 a multiple:\n     - If X = 5, then 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n       - (7)※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.\n       - This satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **Case 2: X is a multiple of 25**\n   - Then 25※X = X/25 + 2.\n   - We need to find (X/25 + 2)※14 = 4.\n   - For the result to be 4, (X/25 + 2) must be a multiple of 14, or 14 must be a multiple of (X/25 + 2).\n   - Let's test possible values of X that make X a multiple of 25:\n     - If X = 25, then 25※25 = 25/25 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3.\n       - (3)※14 = 14/3 + 2, which is not an integer and does not equal 4.\n       - No other multiple of 25 will work since the result will not be 4.\n\n3. **Case 3: Neither 25 is a multiple of X nor X is a multiple of 25**\n   - Then 25※X = 24.\n   - We need to find 24※14 = 4.\n   - For the result to be 4, 24 must be a multiple of 14, or 14 must be a multiple of 24.\n   - 24 is not a multiple of 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 24.\n   - Therefore, 24※14 = 24, which does not satisfy the condition.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only value of X that satisfies the condition is X = 5.\n\nThus, the answer is: [[5]]."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[5 or 125]]", "response_origin": "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 25 ※ X ※ 14 = 4 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( X \\) such that the operation results in 4.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\( 25 ※ X \\)\n\nWe need to consider the possible values for \\( 25 ※ X \\):\n\n1. **If \\( 25 \\) is a multiple of \\( X \\):**\n   \\[ 25 ※ X = \\frac{25}{X} + 2 \\]\n   We need this to be a number that, when operated with 14, results in 4.\n\n2. **If \\( X \\) is a multiple of \\( 25 \\):**\n   \\[ 25 ※ X = \\frac{X}{25} + 2 \\]\n   Again, we need this to be a number that, when operated with 14, results in 4.\n\n3. **If neither is a multiple of the other:**\n   \\[ 25 ※ X = 24 \\]\n   We need to check if 24, when operated with 14, results in 4.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate \\( Y ※ 14 = 4 \\)\n\nLet's denote \\( Y = 25 ※ X \\).

The operation a#b requires the average of all even numbers between a and b, including a and b if they are even. For 4#6, the even numbers are 4, 6. The average is calculated as follows:\n\n(4 + 6) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\n\nBut since we are averaging even numbers, the correct calculation should account for both numbers being even:\n\n(4 + 6) / 2 = 5\n\nThus, the correct answer is indeed:\n\n[[5]] \n\nHowever, since 5 is not an even number and the operation specifically asks for the average of even numbers, the correct answer, considering the
