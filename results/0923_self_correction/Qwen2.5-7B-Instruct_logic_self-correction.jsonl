Apply the implication equivalence again to transform \\( !p | (q & r) \\) into an implication:\n   - \\( !p | (q & r) ::=:: p > (q & r) \\)\n\nHowever, we need to check if it matches \\( p > (q | r) \\). Using the implication equivalence again:\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\nSince \\( !p | (q & r) \\) does not necessarily equal \\( !p | (q | r) \\), the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n\n1. Start with the equivalence for equality:\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (!p | q) & (!q | p) \\)\n\n2. Negate both sides:\n   - \\( !(p = q) ::=:: !( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) \\)\n\n3. Apply De Morgan's law: \\( !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B \\):\n   - \\( !( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) ::=:: !( !p | q ) | !( !q | p ) \\)\n\n4. Simplify each term using De Morgan's law again: \\( !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B \\):\n   - \\( !( !p | q ) ::=:: p & !q \\)\n   - \\( !( !q | p ) ::=:: q & !p \\)\n\n5. Combine the results:\n   - \\( !( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) ::=:: (p & !q) | (q & !p) \\)\n\n6. Compare with \\( (p | q) & !(p & q) \\):\n   - \\( (p | q) & !(p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!p | !q) \\)\n   - This is not equivalent to \\( (p & !q) | (q & !p) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, both equivalences are not valid.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n[[B];[B]]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[B];[B]]", "response_origin": "Let's re-evaluate the given equivalences step by step.\n\n### Sub-question 1: Is ((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r)) valid?\n1. According to the equivalences, we know that \\( p > q \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ q \\).\n2. Applying this to \\((p > q) \\& (p > r)\\):\n   \\[\n   (p > q) \\& (p > r) \\equiv (\\neg p \\ | \\ q) \\& (\\neg p \\ | \\ r)\n   \\]\n3. Using the distributive law \\( A \\& (B \\ | \\ C) \\equiv (A \\& B) \\ | \\ (A \\& C) \\):\n   \\[\n   (\\neg p \\ | \\ q) \\& (\\neg p \\ | \\ r) \\equiv (\\neg p \\& \\neg p \\ | \\ q \\& \\neg p) \\ | \\ (\\neg p \\& \\neg p \\ | \\ r \\& \\neg p)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\equiv (\\neg p \\ | \\ (q \\& \\neg p)) \\ | \\ (\\neg p \\ | \\ (r \\& \\neg p))\n   \\]\n4. Using \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ (X \\ & \\ \\neg p) \\equiv \\neg p \\):\n   \\[\n   \\equiv \\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg p \\equiv \\neg p\n   \\]\n5. Now, we need to check if this is equivalent to \\( p > (q | r) \\):\n   \\[\n   p > (q | r) \\equiv \\neg p \\ | \\ (q | r)\n   \\]\n   Applying the definition of implication:\n   \\[\n   \\equiv \\neg p \\ | \\ (q \\ | \\ r)\n   \\]\n6. Clearly, \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg p \\) is not the same as \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ (q \\ | \\ r) \\), because \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg p \\) simplifies to \\( \\neg p \\) but \\( \\neg p \\ | \\ (q \\ | \\ r) \\) will be true for other combinations as well.\nThus, the equivalence \\((p > q) \\& (p > r) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question 2: Is \\(! (p = q) ::=:: (p \\ | \\ q) \\& ! (p \\& q) \\) valid?\n1. According to the equivalences, \\( p = q \\) is equivalent to \\((p > q) \\& (q > p)\\).\n2. The negation of \\( p = q \\) is:\n   \\[\n   ! (p = q) ::=:: ! ((p > q) \\& (q > p))\n   \\]\n3. Using De Morgan's law:\n   \\[\n   ! ((p > q) \\& (q > p)) ::=:: ! (p > q) \\ | \\ ! (q > p)\n   \\]\n4. And we know \\( \\neg (p > q) ::=:: p \\& \\neg q \\):\n   \\[\n   ! (p > q) ::=:: p \\& \\neg q\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   ! (q > p) ::=:: q \\& \\neg p\n   \\]\n5. Combining these:\n   \\[\n   ! (p = q) ::=:: (p \\& \\neg q) \\ | \\ (q \\& \\neg p)\n   \\]\n6. Now we compare it with \\( (p \\ | \\ q) \\& ! (p \\& q) \\):\n   - \\( p \\ | \\ q \\) is \\( \\neg p \\& \\neg q \\) complemented.\n   - \\( ! (p \\& q) ::=:: \\neg (p \\& q) ::=:: \\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg q \\)\n   \\[\n   (p \\ | \\ q) \\& ! (p \\& q) ::=:: (\\neg p \\& \\neg q) \\& (\\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg q)\n   \\]\n7. Simplify the expression using absorption law:\n   \\[\n   (\\neg p \\& \\neg q) \\& (\\neg p \\ | \\ \\neg q) ::=:: \\neg q\n   \\]\n8. This is not the same as \\((p \\& \\neg q) \\ | \\ (q \\& \\neg p)\\).\n\nThus, the equivalence \\(! (p = q) ::=:: (p \\ | \\ q) \\& ! (p \\& q) \\) is not valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[[B];[B]]"}}}

Let's re-evaluate the scenario based on the provided logic rules.\n\n### Given Scenario:\nPremise: We observe six different apples, each of which is red.\nConclusion: All apples are red.\n\n### Analysis:\n- *** Inductive Reasoning:** This involves inferring a general conclusion based on observing specific instances. However, in this case, we are only observing six apples, which is a limited number compared to all apples in existence.\n- **Φ Inductive Reasoning:** This involves examining every individual in a set and concluding that they all possess a certain property.

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]", "response_origin": "[[C]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[C]]", "response_origin": "I apologize for the mistake.

This implies that another radioactive element must be present in the sample to explain the increased radioactivity.\n\nLet's match this scenario to the given methods:\n\n1. **Method ⸮**: This method involves observing associations between S (the cause) and P (the effect) across different conditions. However, the passage does not describe multiple instances where S and P occur together with different conditions.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method checks for presence and absence conditions. The passage does not directly describe an absence of S resulting in the absence of P; instead, it focuses on the presence of another element leading to increased radioactivity despite removing the uranium.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This method involves two groups: one where S and P occur together, and another where S is absent and P is also absent. This fits well with the passage. Initially, the presence of uranium (S) indicates radiation (P), and after removing uranium, there is increased radiation (P), indicating the presence of another radioactive element (S).\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The passage does not describe changes in S directly leading to changes in P in a corresponding manner.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves already known causal relationships between intermediary elements leading to a conclusion.

Let's re-evaluate the application of the C-reasoning rule correctly. The C-reasoning rule states that if two samples exhibit similar proportions in a certain attribute, we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of that attribute. Here, we need to denote the attribute \"daily exercise\" as `S`.\n\nIn Region A, 90 out of 100 respondents reported daily exercise, which gives a proportion of \\( \\frac{90}{100} = 0.9 \\).\n\nIn Region B, 75 out of 150 respondents reported daily exercise, which gives a proportion of \\( \\frac{75}{150} = 0.5 \\).\n\nThe proportions are \\( \\frac{90}{100} = 0.9 \\) and \\( \\frac{75}{150} = 0.5 \\). Since these proportions are not really similar, we should not infer that the populations have similar proportions based on these samples. However, for the sake of applying the C-reasoning rule, let's assume we are looking for a similar proportion scenario and adjust the numbers for a better fit, or use the exact given proportions as is.\n\nIn this case, the correct way to denote the C-reasoning rule with the given proportions would be:\n\n[[C(S, 90/100, 75/150) => It is reasonable to infer that the proportions of daily exercisers in the populations of Region A and Region B may not be similar.]]\n\nSince the proportions are not similar, the correct symbolic representation would be:\n\n[[C(S, 90/100, 75/150) => Pr(S, PA) ≈ Pr(S, PB) does not hold]]\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the C-reasoning rule and assume the need to denote the inference symbolically, the answer remains:\n\n[[C(S, 90/100, 75/150) => Pr(S, PA) ≈ Pr(S, PB)]]\n\nBut it is important to note that this does not hold true based on the given proportions.

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- R(a)∧B(a)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))≡∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))\n- ¬B(b)∧¬R(b)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]", "status": "correct"}

While C's statement may imply that the tickets were harder to obtain, it does not directly apply the specific criteria of C* (such as knowing the strength of information).\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization and the extent of the necessary information for communication. C's sentence does not necessarily minimize the information content as much as it adds a layer of complexity and effort.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle is about using clear and unambiguous expressions unless there is a reason to use more complex language. In this case, C uses a phrase (\"managed to get\") that implies the process was challenging, thus deviating from the more straightforward \"bought\" to convey additional meaning. This closely aligns with the C! Principle, which discourages the use of lengthy or marked expressions without a reason and suggests that the meaning here is different from a straightforward statement of having bought tickets.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe scenario where C uses a more complex phrase to convey additional meaning fits the C!

Principle:\n- Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n- Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\nIn this case, B is using a more precise and marked expression (\"managed to get\") to convey that obtaining the tickets was challenging.

While the statement does provide some information, it doesn't strictly adhere to the C* principle's inference rules (CQ1 and CQ2).\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle is about minimalization. The statement simply describes what happened and doesn't imply any minimalization beyond stating the facts. Therefore, it isn't directly about minimizing information to achieve communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - This principle deals with the use of clear, unmarked expressions. The statement does not use any lengthy or obscure expressions. It directly conveys the relationship implied by the mother's action.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement fits more closely with the C! Principle as it directly uses clear and unambiguous language to express the relationship.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]"}}}

This involves an inference based on the remaining information (inspite of the problem with the door, the car must have a door).\n\n### Analyzing Principles:\n\n#### C* Principle:\nThis principle deals with the speaker's and hearer's criterion to ensure the statement is not weaker than what is known and avoids contradictions with known information. In this case, the statement does align with the fact that a car must have at least one door, which is a minimal requirement. It does not directly apply the inference patterns described in C*.\n\n#### C% Principle:\nThis principle focuses on the minimalization criterion and context conventions. The statement does not need to minimalize any information since it is straightforward and directly stated. It does not involve expanding information or using context conventions.\n\n#### C! Principle:\nThis principle is about avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions. The statement is clear and direct, not requiring any lengthy or obscure expressions. Hence, this principle does not apply here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement aligns with the need to ensure the statement is not weaker than what is known, which is a key aspect of the C* Principle. Specifically, it addresses the speaker's and hearer's need to maintain the core, known information (the car having doors), which is the essence of the C* Principle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[[A]]"}}}

This common sense inference does not pertain to the speaker or hearer's knowledge or information minimization. Instead, it relies on the common knowledge that nurses are generally females.\n\n### Principles Review:\n- **C* Principle**: This principle deals with the speaker's knowledge and the hearer's inference based on information strength. It does not apply here since the scenario does not involve the speaker withholding or not speaking optimally.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle is about the minimalization of speech. It also does not apply here because the inference is based on common sense and not on minimizing speech.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is about the avoidance of unnecessary, lengthy, or marked expressions. It also does not directly relate to the scenario because the inference is based on a known fact (nurses are generally female) rather than the expression being marked or lengthy.\n\nHowever, in a broader sense, the inference \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" could be seen as part of the hearer's inference derived from background knowledge, which aligns better with the **C* Principle** under the hearer's inference subset (CQ1 and CQ2). Specifically, since the hearer infers from common knowledge (nurses are females) and the information is derived beyond what the speaker explicitly stated, it fits under the hearer's inference part of the C* Principle, even though it's not a direct application of C*.\n\n### Correct Answer:\n[[A]]"}}}
