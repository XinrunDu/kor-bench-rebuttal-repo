Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nDefine an operation such that when a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2.\nWhen b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2.\nIf a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\nBoth a and b are integers.\n\n### Question:\nIf 25※X※14=4, find X.\nWhen providing your answer, please enclose it in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. \nIf there is more than one correct answer, separate the answers with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[5]]", "response_origin": "To solve this, we need to evaluate the operation 25※X※14=4 based on the given operation rule. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven the operation definitions:\n1. a※b = a/b + 2, if a is a multiple of b.\n2. a※b = b/a + 2, if b is a multiple of a.\n3. a※b = 24, if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a.\n\nThe expression is 25※X※14=4. This means the operation is applied to 25 and X first, and then the result is operated on 14 to equal 4.\n\nLet's consider each case for 25※X:\n\n### Case 1: 25 is a multiple of X\nIf 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X = 25/X + 2.\nNow, let’s apply this to 14:\n(25/X + 2)※14 = 4.\nWe need to check what X can be if 25 is a multiple of X. The multiples of 25 are 1, 5, 25. We test these:\n\n- If X = 1, then 25※1 = 25/1 + 2 = 27. So, (27)※14 = 27/14 + 2 = ≈5.93 (which does not equal 4).\n- If X = 5, then 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 7. So, (7)※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 4, which works.\n- If X = 25, then 25※25 = 25/25 + 2 = 3. So, (3)※14 = 14/3 + 2 = ≈8.67 (which does not equal 4).\n\nSo, X = 5 works in this case.\n\n### Case 2: X is a multiple of 25\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 is not directly specified to be a multiple of X without further information. Since we need to find a solution that holds, and X = 5 works (from the first case), we proceed without this being a limit.\n\n### Case 3: X is not a multiple of 25 and 25 is not a multiple of X\nIf X is not a multiple of 25, we would have 25※X = 24, but this would not align directly with the requirement to reach 4 with the subsequent operation, as this leaves us no flexibility to target 4 in the second part based on the given rule alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is based on the only value that satisfies the operation, which is X = 5.\n\nThus, the final answer is: [[5]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[5]]", "response_origin": "Let's carefully analyze the problem step-by-step based on the operation rule provided.\n\nGiven the expression \\(25※X※14 = 4\\), we need to figure out how \\(X\\) fits into the equation. According to the rule, there are three cases based on the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n1. If \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), then \\(a※b = a/b + 2\\).\n2. If \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), then \\(a※b = b/a + 2\\).\n3. If neither \\(a\\) nor \\(b\\) is a multiple of the other, then \\(a※b = 24\\).\n\nWe can infer the sequence of operations from left to right, so we need to evaluate \\(25※X\\) first, and then use that result to evaluate \\(Z※14\\), where \\(Z = 25※X\\).\n\n### Case 1: If \\(25\\) is a multiple of \\(X\\)\nThis is not possible since \\(25\\) is not a multiple of any number that would make \\(25※X\\) have a result leading to \\(4\\) when further operated with \\(14\\).\n\n### Case 2: If \\(X\\) is a multiple of \\(25\\)\nIn this case, \\(25※X = 2 + 2 = 4\\), but this does not help us directly determine \\(X\\) since \\(X\\) could be 50, 75, 100, etc., which are not likely to fit well in the next step because \\(25※X = 4\\) would imply \\(X = 25 \\times 2 = 50\\), and we need to check if \\(50※14\\) can equal 4.\n\n### Case 3: If 25 is not a multiple of \\(X\\) and \\(X\\) is not a multiple of 25\nThis leads to \\(25※X = 24\\). Now we need to find \\(X\\) such that \\(24※14 = 4\\).\n\nIf \\(24 = a\\) and \\(14 = b\\), we need to check the conditions:\n- \\(24 = 14 \\times \\frac{24}{14}\\) which is not an integer, so this does not fit.\n- \\(14 = 24 \\times \\frac{14}{24}\\) which is not an integer, so this does not fit either.\n\nNow, we need \\(24※14 = 2 + 2 = 4\\) which means \\(14 = 24 \\times 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 / 12\\), which is not an exact multiple. So, the only way is to check the integer solution:\n- If we consider \\(24 = 14 \\times 1.714 \\approx 14 \\times 1.714\\) and we need to confirm that only integer solution fits, and this simplifies to \\(X = 5\\).\n\nSo, we need to check if \\(25※5 = 4\\):\n- \\(25 = 5 \\times 5\\), so \\(25※5 = 5 + 2 = 7\\), this is not 4.\n\nFinally, we need to check \\(25※5 = 5 + 2 = 7\\), and then \\(7※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\nThus, the only correct value for \\(X\\) is \\(5\\).\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{[[5]]}\\)."}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[25※14k = \\frac{25}{14k} + 2\n     \\]]", "response_origin": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the given operation rule.\n\nThe operation rule is:\n- If \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), then \\(a※b = \\frac{a}{b} + 2\\).\n- If \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), then \\(a※b = \\frac{b}{a} + 2\\).\n- If \\(a\\) is not a multiple of \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) is not a multiple of \\(a\\), then \\(a※b = 24\\).\n\nWe need to solve the equation \\(25※X※14 = 4\\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values of \\(X\\):\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(X\\) is a multiple of 14.**\n   - Then \\(25※X = \\frac{25}{X} + 2\\).\n   - Since \\(X\\) is a multiple of 14, let \\(X = 14k\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer.

The equation becomes \\(8※(k + 2) = 3\\). We need to evaluate this further.\n\n- If \\(k + 2\\) is a multiple of 8, then \\(k + 2 = 8m\\), \\(k = 8m - 2\\), and \\(X = 13(8m - 2) = 104m - 26\\). This form of \\(X\\) needs to satisfy the equation.\n- If \\(k + 2\\) is not a multiple of 8 and 8 is not a multiple of \\(k + 2\\), then \\(8※(k + 2) = 24\\), which cannot be 3. Hence, \\(k + 2\\) must be a multiple of 8.\n\nGiven the equation \\(8※(k + 2) = 3\\), let's assume \\(k + 2 = 8\\), so \\(k = 6\\). Therefore, \\(X = 13 \\times 6 = 78\\).\n\n- Check: \\(78※13 = \\frac{78}{13} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\), then \\(8※8 = \\frac{8}{8} + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\\), which is correct.\n\nThus, the correct value of \\(X\\) is \\(78\\).\n\nThe answer is: [[78]]", "status": "max_rounds", "history": {"0": {"prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations.

The expression given is 19※28※4※(X※13) = 3.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate 19※28:\n- Since 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19, by the rule, 19※28 = 24.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 24※4※(X※13) = 3.\n\nNext, let's evaluate 24※4:\n- Since 24 is a multiple of 4, 24※4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the expression now is 8※(X※13) = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate X※13. Let’s denote the result of X※13 as Y, so the expression becomes 8※Y = 3.\n\nWe need to consider three cases based on the definitions of the operation:\n1. If X is a multiple of 13, then Y = 13/*X + 2. But we don't know X and cannot directly solve for 8※Y = 3 with this.\n2. If 13 is a multiple of X, then Y = X/13 + 2. To solve 8※(X/13 + 2) = 3, we need to consider if X/13 + 2 can be a form that makes this operation simplify. However, since 13 is not a multiple of X based on typical integers, we focus on the next case.\n3. If X is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of X, then Y = 24. Evaluating 8※24 would not satisfy the condition 8※Y = 3.\n\nBy the operation rule, if 13 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 13, we are left with the only possibility where the multiple check failed, which we evaluate directly:\n- If Y = 24 and we try to solve 8※24 = 24/8 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 (which doesn’t match), then we need X/13 + 2 = 3. Solving X/13 + 2 = 3, we get X/13 = 1, so X = 13.\n\nThus, the value of X is [[13]]."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[286]]", "response_origin": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step while adhering to the given operation rule.\n\nGiven the expression \\(19 \\※ 28 \\※ 4 \\※ (X \\※ 13) = 3\\), we will simplify it from the innermost part first.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\(X \\※ 13\\)\n\nWe do not know \\(X\\) yet, so we will keep it as is for now and proceed to evaluate the outer parts of the expression.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate \\(19 \\※ 28\\)\n\nSince 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19, according to the rule:\n\\[19 \\※ 28 = 24\\]\n\nNow the expression simplifies to:\n\\[24 \\※ 4 \\※ (X \\※ 13) = 3\\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \\(24 \\※ 4\\)\n\nSince 24 is a multiple of 4, according to the rule:\n\\[24 \\※ 4 = \\frac{24}{4} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\]\n\nNow the expression simplifies to:\n\\[8 \\※ (X \\※ 13) = 3\\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate \\(8 \\※ (X \\※ 13)\\)\n\nWe need to determine \\(X \\※ 13\\) first to proceed. Let's denote \\(Y = X \\※ 13\\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine \\(Y\\)\n\nSince the result of \\(8 \\※ Y\\) must be 3, we need to find when the operation equals 3. We consider the two cases for the operation:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(8\\) is a multiple of \\(Y\\)**\n\nThis is not possible because 8 is not a multiple of any other number (other than 1, 2, 4, and 8), and the only valid results would be \\(8 \\※ 1 = 3\\), \\(8 \\※ 2 = 2\\), \\(8 \\※ 4 = 1\\), or \\(8 \\※ 8 = \\frac{3}{1} + 2 = 5\\), none of which match 3.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(Y\\) is a multiple of \\(8\\)**\n\nSo, \\(Y \\) must be 8 (since any larger multiple would yield results more than 3). Thus:\n\\[Y = 8\\]\n\nNow, we know \\(X \\※ 13 = 8\\).\n\n### Step 6: Determine \\(X\\)\n\nAgain, since \\(X \\) and 13 are not related by simple multiples (13 is prime), the only solution for \\(X \\) is through the third case of the rule:\n\\[X \\※ 13 = 24\\]\n\nSolving \\(X \\) from:\n\\[24 = \\frac{X}{13} + 2\\]\n\\[\\frac{X}{13} = 22\\]\n\\[X = 22 \\times 13\\]\n\\[X = 286\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n[[286]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[286]]", "response_origin": "Let's break down the problem step by step using the defined operations.\n\nGiven the expression \\(19※28※4※(X※13) = 3\\), we first need to evaluate the inner operation \\(X※13\\).\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\(X※13\\)\n\nSince \\(X\\) is unknown, we need to check the conditions for \\(X※13\\):\n\n- If \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, then \\(X※13 = \\frac{X}{13} + 2\\).\n- If 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\), then \\(X※13 = \\frac{13}{X} + 2\\).\n- If neither condition is met, then \\(X※13 = 24\\).\n\nSince we don't have more information about \\(X\\), we need to evaluate both possibilities for \\(X※13\\).\n\n#### Case 1: \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13\n\nLet \\(X = 13k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer.

The even numbers in this range would be: 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on, depending on the value of \\(X\\).\n\nThe average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers.

So, the possible values for \\(X\\) are \\(X \\geq 10\\).\n\nHowever, we need to re-evaluate because the correct interpretation from the operation definition is that \\(X\\) must be at least 20 for the equation to hold true when considering the division by 2 to equal 5.\n\nSo the correct evaluation is:\n\\[\n\\max(X, 10) = 20 \\implies X = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n[[X ≥ 20]]\n\\]"}}}
