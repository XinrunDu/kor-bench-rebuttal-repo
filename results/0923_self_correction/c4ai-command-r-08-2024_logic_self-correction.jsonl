And so, there are no false assignments, meaning there is no separate column for it. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer for formula (1) is: [[T:x,x,x,x,✓,x,x,✓,x,✓;F:]].\n\nNow, for formula (2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3):\n- This is an implication-type formula, meaning we're only interested in observing the false assignments.\n- When p1=✓, p2=x, and p3=x, the left side of the implication is true (as p1=✓ but p2=x), and the right side is false (as p1=✓ but p3=x), thus satisfying this assignment.\n- By the same logic, p1=x, p2=✓, p3=✓ satisfies the formula, as the left side is false and the right side is true.\n- Also, p1=x, p2=x, p3 is irrelevant satisfies the formula, as both sides are true.\n\nThe only false assignment comes when all the variables are true: p1=✓, p2=✓, p3=✓, which makes the left side false but the right side true.\n\nSo, the false assignments are: ✓|✓|✓, ✓|✗|✗. There are no truth assignments for this formula.\n\nFormula (2) then gives us: [[T:;F:✓|✓|✓,✓|✗|✗]].\n\nIn summary, the complete answer is:\n[[T:x,x,x,x,✓,x,x,✓,x,✓;F:]];[[T:;F:✓|✓|✓,✓|✗|✗]]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[T:x,x,x,x,✓,x,x,✓,x,✓,✓,x,x;F:]]", "response_origin": "[[T:x,x,x,x,✓,x,x,✓,x,✓,✓,x,x;F:]]"}}}

Apologies for the incorrect formatting. Here's the revised answer to your question:\n\n[[F:✓,x,x];[F:x,x];[F:x,x,x,x,x]]\n\nLet's break down each formula and explain the false assignments:\n\n1. ~(~p1&p2)||~p3: In this formula, the connective \"||\" has a higher priority than \"&\" and \"~\". So, we first evaluate the inner portion - ~(~p1&p2). Since this is a negation, if either ~p1 or p2 is false, the whole expression is true. So, the false assignment for this portion is [F:✓,x]. Now, if we have a true value for ~(~p1&p2), we can simplify the full expression to simply ~p3. Thus, the overall false assignments are [F:✓,x,x], where p1 is true, and p2 and p3 are both false.\n\n2. (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2): In this case, we have an \"&\" connective between two sub-formulas. For the left side (~p2||p3), if either ~p2 or p3 is true, the whole expression is true. So, we have false assignments for this portion as [F:x,x]. On the right side, we have (p1=::>p2), which means if p1 is true, then p2 must be true. So, the false assignment for this portion is [F:✓,x]. Therefore, the overall false assignments for the whole formula are [F:x,x], which means both sub-formulas must have a false value.\n\n3. (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1): Again, we have an \"&\" connective between the two sub-formulas. For the left side (p1=::>p2), the formula is false only when p1 is true, and p2 is false. So, the false assignment for this portion is [F:✓,x]. For the right side, (~(p1&p3)||p1), the \"~\" connective has the highest priority, and the \"||\" connective has a higher priority than \"&\". So, if (~(p1&p3)) is true, the whole expression is also true. And if p1 is true, the expression is also true. So, the false assignments for this portion are [F:x,x,x,x]. In this portion, all possible combinations of truth values can make it false. Therefore, the overall false assignments for the whole formula are [F:x,x,x,x], which covers all cases where at least one of the sub-formulas is false."}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[F:x,✓,✓]; [F:x,x]; [F:x,x,x]]", "response_origin": "My apologies, here is a corrected answer:\n\n[[F:x,✓,✓]; [F:x,x]; [F:x,x,x]]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[F:x,✓,✓]; [F:x,x]; [F:x,x]]", "response_origin": "I apologize for the confusion.

This can be reduced further by de Morgan's laws (EQUIVALENCE 16) to simplify the inner NOR: !(!p|!q) | !r\n4. !(!p|!q) is the same as p & q, and we're left with: p & q | !r\n\nSince the left-hand side application of the equivalence results in a valid expression: (p & q) | !r, we can confirm that the equivalence rule (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r) is valid, and hence the answer to the first sub-question is [A].\n\nNow, for the second sub-question (2) (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r): \n\n1.

Again, using de Morgan's laws (EQUIVALENCE 15) to simplify the inner NAND: !(!p&!q) | !r\n4. !(!p&!q) is further simplified as p | q, and we get: p | q | !r\n\nHere, the left side cannot be further reduced to match the right side of the equivalence, which is a contradiction. Hence, the equivalence (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r) is not valid, and the answer to the second sub-question is [B].\n\nSo, the final answer, adhering to the specified format, is: [[A];[B]]. \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or if we can discuss any other logical equivalence."}}}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]]", "response_origin": "Based on the given logic rule and the provided information, we can analyze the problem step by step. \n\n1. Person A's statement: Prof Wang is not from Suzhou (not p) and he is from Shanghai (q). So, we can represent Person A's statement as:\n    - !p & q \n\n2. Person B's statement: Prof Wang is not from Shanghai (not q) and he is from Suzhou (p). So, Person B's statement is:\n    - !q & p \n\n3. Person C's statement: Prof Wang is neither from Shanghai nor Hangzhou (not q and not r). Thus, Person C's statement can be written as:\n    - !q & !r \n\n\nNow, let's consider Professor Wang's remarks:\n- One of you got everything right: This refers to the correct identification of Professor Wang's origin. If one person got everything right, it means that their statement is entirely true. In this case, either p, q, or r must be true.\n- One got half right: This implies that some part of a person's statement is correct, while another part is incorrect. For instance, if P were true, and the other two (Q and R) were false, this would mean that the statement 'Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (not p) and he is from Shanghai (q)' is partly right.\n- One got everything wrong: This means that a person's statement is entirely false. If Q were true, and both P and R were false, then the statement 'Professor Wang is not from Shanghai (not q), and he is from Suzhou (p)' would be entirely wrong.\n\nSo, evaluating each person's claim in the light of Professor Wang's comments, we get: \n1. Person A: Since 'p' is false and 'q' is true, we can say that Person A got one right (Prof is from Shanghai) but had the other claim wrong (Prof was not from Suzhou). \n    - Half-right: A\n\n2. Person B: With 'q' being true, and 'p' false, Person B made an accurate statement about Prof Wang being from Shanghai. But, their claim about Prof's not being from Suzhou is wrong. \n    - Half-right: B\n\n3. Person C: 'q' is false, and 'r' is also false based on the information. So, Person C made a statement that is entirely wrong. \n    - Entirely Wrong: C\n\nGiven that exactly one of p, q, and r is true, the truth is p, meaning Professor Wang is from Suzhou. So, the answer can be summarized as follows:\n\n[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]] \n\nThe corresponding choices are:\n\n[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: A, B]; [entirely incorrect: C]]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: -]; [entirely incorrect: B, C]]", "response_origin": "My apologies for the oversight. Let's carefully analyze the given statements and Professor Wang's remarks to determine the correct answer. \n\nGiven that only one of p, q, or r can be true, and from Professor Wang's remarks, we can deduce the following: \n\nIf Person A got everything right, then p should be false and q true. \nIf Person B got everything right, then p should be true and q false. \n\nFor Person C: \n- If they got everything right, then q should be false and r true. \n- If they got partially correct, then q should be false and r false, or q should be true and r false - in either case, q would remain false. \n\nNow, let's analyze Professor Wang's remark about each having a different level of correctness: \n\n**One Got Everything Right:** \n\nSince one person got everything right, either A or B must be correct, as they made mutually exclusive statements about Suzhou and Shanghai (p or q). If A is correct, then p should be false and q true, resulting in: \n>> Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n\nIf B is correct, then p should be true and q false, resulting in: \n>> Professor Wang is from Suzhou.\n\nSo, the person who got everything right could be either Person A or Person B, depending on if Professor Wang is from Shanghai or Suzhou, respectively. \n\n**One Got Half Right:** \n\nIf a person is partially correct, they could be partially right or wrong. For instance, Person A being partially correct could mean they correctly identified Professor Wang as being from Shanghai (since q is true), but inaccurately ruled out Suzhou (p is technically possible but false). The same logic applies to Person B and Person C. Thus, the person who got half right could be any of the three, depending on the given truth of p, q, and r. \n\n**One Got Everything Wrong:** \n\nSince no one got everything right, and given that only one person got everything wrong, we can deduce that whoever got everything wrong made mutually incorrect statements about both Suzhou and Shanghai, as these are the only cities discussed by Person A and B. In this case, if we assume Person A got everything wrong, then both p and q should be false, which is impossible since they’re mutually exclusive and at least one must be true. \n\nSo, to negate both, we could use De Morgan’s law: \n\n>> !(p ∨ q) = !p ∧ !q\n\nApplying this, we get: \n\n>> !p & !q\n\nAs a result, to narrow this down further, we could also consider what was mentioned about Person C, who said that Professor Wang is not from Hangzhou. If this statement is to maintain the same form regardless of the truth of p and q, it would need to be a universal negation such as: \n\n>> !(p ∨ q ∨ r) ≡ !p ∧ !q ∧ !r\n\nWhich simplifies to: \n\n>> !q & !r\n\nThus, for anyone to be right or half right, !q & !r needs to be dismissed as it would indicate everything is wrong. \n\nSo, combining these, the final expression would be: \n\n>> (!p & !q) ∨ (p & !q)\n\nNow, according to Professor Wang, one person got everything right and was thus accurate about both cities, another got half right and made one correct statement but another incorrect one, and the last one got everything wrong. Given the above analysis, the most likely scenario is:\n\nProfessor Wang is from Shanghai and Professor A got everything right.\n\nProfessor Wang is not from Suzhou or Hangzhou; thus, Professor B and Professor C got everything wrong.\n\nNow, to provide the answer in the requested format: \n\n[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: -]; [entirely incorrect: B, C]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: -]; [entirely incorrect: B, C]]", "response_origin": "Apologies for the previous incorrect answers.

For instance, if we have the variable 'p', its literal form could be 'p' or its negation, '¬p'.\n\n- The complement of a literal 'L' is denoted as L' and is taken by switching between 'p' and '¬p' in the given example.\n\n- Resolution is a process where two simple disjunctive clauses (disjunctions), C1 and C2, are used to derive a new clause, 'dispel(C1, C2)', based on their shared literals. If the 'dispel' operation results in an empty set (labelled as 0), we can conclude that the conjunctive normal form is 'Implausible'.\n\n- The Resolution Algorithm is a systematic process to assess whether a conjunctive normal form (CNF) has a satisfying assignment, yielding 'Plausible' or 'Implausible' as its verdict. The algorithm involves initializing sets, performing iterative resolutions, and terminating upon specific conditions.\n\n**Answer to the Question:**\n\nAs per the logic rule and algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize:\n   - Let S0 and S2 be empty. Let S1 contain all simple disjunctive clauses:\n     - S1 = {p, (p∨q), (p∨¬q), (q∨¬r), (q∨r)}\n\n2.

Resolve S1:\n   - (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) can be resolved:\n     - dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) = (⊥)\n     - Output: \"Implausible\"\n     - The algorithm terminates here since we found a contradiction leading to an unsatisfiable assignment.\n\nSo, the resolution algorithm's output: [[Implausible];[1]].\n\nAs the algorithm only went through one cycle before terminating, the answer is [[Implausible];[1]]."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "Apologies for the oversight.

Resolving clauses in S0 and S1:\n\nWe don't need to perform this step for this problem since S0 is empty. \n\n3. Resolving clauses in S1: \n\na. For the first two clauses in S1, namely, [p ∨ q] and [p ∨ ¬q], we can resolve to a new clause [True]. This is because the literal p is negated to ¬p in the second clause, and as a result, the conjunction of these two clauses can be simplified to True. \n\nResulting new clause: [True] = 1\n\nb. For [True] and [¬p ∨ r], we can resolve to a new clause [r].

In this specific application, we define 𝐸 as the set of natural numbers, N.\n- Every entity constant 'a' in the language has a corresponding entity 'a′' in 𝐸. In this case, 'a′' has been assigned the value of 0.\n- The language also contains functions and predicates. Specifically, we are given examples:\n  - Two binary functions, fJ(x, y) and gJ(x, y), which perform addition and multiplication, respectively.\n  - A binary predicate, FJ(x, y), which denotes equality between two entities, i.e., x = y.\n\n**Implentation of the Formula under J**\n\nLet's proceed with rewriting the given formula, ∀xF(g(x,a),x) → F(x,y), as it would appear under the interpretation J:\n1. We start with the formula ∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y). To implement this under J, we first need to consider the function symbols and entity constants.\n2. Replacing the entity constant 'a′' with its assigned value, 0, we have: ∀xF(g(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n3. Next, we should look at the function symbol 'g':\n- In the function g(x, y), we substitute 'g' with its implementation 'gJ': ∀xF(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n4. Since the domain of discourse, 𝐸, is the set of natural numbers, this will hold for all entities in N. Therefore, we do not need to include the universal quantifier, ∀x, in our implementation. Applying this modification, our formula becomes: F(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n5. Finally, we substitute the predicate symbol 'F' with its implementation 'FJ': ∀xF(FJ(gJ(x,0),x),x) → F(FJ(x,y),y).\n\nNow, let's apply the implementation process to the formula in a line-by-line manner:\n- ∀x[F(g(x, a), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(g(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)\n\n**Final Answer**: [∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)]"}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[F(g(x, 0), x) -> F(x, y)]]", "response_origin": "My apologies for the previous incorrect answer.

They cannot coexist as both being true, but they can both be false. For example, in a scenario where smoking is allowed in certain areas of a public place, neither obligation nor prohibition holds, making both sentences false.\n\n3. \"Not fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" - This statement can be represented as \"§¬fulfillsContract\". It denotes permission (§) for not fulfilling (¬) the contract (fulfillsContract).\n4. \"Fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" - This can be represented as \"§fulfillsContract\", showing permission (§) to fulfill (fulfills) the contract (contract).\n\nThese two sentences are in an \"@-relation\". This is because the negation of one leads to the other. For instance, if you are permitted to fulfill the contract, it implies that you are not permitted to not fulfill it, and vice versa.

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[: C. ꙮ method]]", "response_origin": "The correct answer is [: C. ꙮ method]."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[A. ⸮ method]]", "response_origin": "[A. ⸮ method]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[C. ꙮ method]]", "response_origin": "Oops, my answer was indeed incorrect!

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- R(a)∧B(a)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))≡∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))\n- ¬B(b)∧¬R(b)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]", "status": "correct"}

Let's follow the principles and evaluate the given statement:\n\nXiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. → Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female. (Common sense inference type)\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- C* Principle (Speaker's Criterion): This principle guides the speaker to provide information that aligns with their knowledge, striving to avoid sharing insignificant content. In this context, the speaker may know that nurses are typically associated with female gender, making this a reasonable inference. However, it doesn't directly contradict any information principle, so it doesn't fall under CQ1. Since it's an inference about a broader category, CQ2 doesn't apply either. Thus, the C* Principle isn't applicable here.\n\n- C% Principle (Hearer's Inference): The Minimalization Criterion suggests that information should be presented concisely and only to the extent necessary. In this case, by directly stating \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse,\" the speaker provides minimal information, which conforms to this principle. The convention inference rule (CI1) and the exact match set rule (CI2) also seem inapplicable as they address specific wording and contextual conventions, which aren't present in this statement. Hence, we can infer that the C% Principle is applicable for the hearer.\n\n- C! Principle (Speaker's Criterion): This principle discourages the use of marked expressions without reason. In this context, the expression \"a female\" can be considered a marked expression, differing from the unmarked expression \"a nurse.\" The speaker's choice to use \"a female\" implies that they are making a point about gender rather than merely describing the person receiving flowers. This meets the criteria and aligns with the C! Principle.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement conforms to the **C* Principle** [[A]] and the **C! Principle** [[C]].

In this case, Xiao Wang's action of giving flowers to a nurse implies that the recipient is a female, which aligns with common sense and is a stronger statement than simply implying any person or individual. \n\nTherefore, the provided statement complies with the C* Principle."}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[A]]", "response_origin": "My apologies, I will review the logic rule and the provided information once again.\n\nBased on the information provided and the principles outlined, the correct answer would be: \n\n[[A]]\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. → Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\" is an example of a valid inference according to the C* Principle. \n\nThe C* Principle guides speakers to not let their statements be weaker than their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle. In this case, the speaker's statement about giving flowers to a nurse implies that they are speaking about a female, which aligns with the knowledge that nurses are typically females. This satisfies the C* Principle as the speaker is making a stronger, more specific statement based on their knowledge without contradicting any established information."}}}
