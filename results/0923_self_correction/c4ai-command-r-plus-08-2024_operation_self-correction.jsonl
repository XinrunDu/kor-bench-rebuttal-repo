The correct answer is either [[133 or 131]].\n\nThe solution requires multiple steps and involves applying the custom operation rules at each stage. \n\n1. First, we can simplify the expression:\n19※28※4※(X※13)\n= (19※28)※(4※(X※13))\n\n2. Now, we can calculate 19※28:\n- Since 19 is not a multiple of 28 and vice versa, the result is 24.\n\n3. Next, we can simplify the expression again:\n24※ (4※(X※13))\n= (24※4)※(X※13)\n\n4. Now, we can calculate 24※4:\n- As 24 is a multiple of 4, the result is 24/4 + 2 = 7.\n\n5. So, the expression becomes:\n7※(X※13)\n\n6. Now, for this expression to equal 3, X※13 must be equal to 3/7.\n\n7. Calculate X※13 based on the rules:\n- Since neither the number X nor 13 is a multiple of the other, the operation results in 24.\n\n8. So, we have 24 = 3/7, which is not true.\n\nThis means we must go back and try a different scenario for step 7 based on the rules:\n- If X is a multiple of 13, X※13 equals X/13 + 2.\n- Let's assume X = 13k, where k is an integer. Then:\n13k※13 = 13k/13 + 2 = k + 2\n\n9. With the above result, we now have:\n7※(k + 2) = 3\n=> 7k + 14 = 3\n=> 7k = -11\n=> k = -11/7\n\n10. Now we can find the two possible values of X:\nX = 13k = 13 * (-11/7) = -143/7. However, X needs to be an integer, so X must equal:\n- 133, the numerator of the fraction, plus 7\n- 131, the numerator of the fraction, minus 7\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [[133 or 131]]."}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[134 or 128]]", "response_origin": "[[134 or 128]]"}}}

Given the expression 5 ◇ 2 ◇ X = 625, we can apply the operation rule:\n\n5^2^X = 625\n\n3. Now, we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation.

To solve for X, take the logarithm (base 2) of both sides:\n\nX * log(2) = log(5^4)\n\n6. Since log(5^4) = 4 * log(5), the equation becomes:\n\nX * log(2) = 4 * log(5)\n\n7.

Let's resolve this issue and find the correct answer. \n\nTo find the value of $X$, we need to simplify the given expression:\n$4①(X①2) = 20$ \n\nFirst, we handle the inner operation:\n$X①2 = \\sqrt{X} + 2^2 = \\sqrt{X} + 4$ \n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the main equation:\n$4①(\\sqrt{X} + 4) = 20$ \n\nAccording to the definition of the operation $①$, we calculate $4①(\\sqrt{X}+4)$  as follows:\n$4①(\\sqrt{X} + 4) = \\sqrt{4} + (\\sqrt{X} + 4)^2$. \n\nSimplifying the square root and the square, we get:\n$2 + (\\sqrt{X} + 4)^2 = 2 + X + 8\\sqrt{X} + 16 = 18 + X + 8\\sqrt{X}$. \n\nNow, we can continue simplifying the equation:\n$18 + X + 8\\sqrt{X} = 20$. \n\nSubtracting 18 from both sides, we find:\n$X + 8\\sqrt{X} = 2$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation.

First, let's solve the inner operation:\n   X①2 = √X + 2^2\n   X①2 = √X + 4\n\n2. Now, we can plug this result into the outer operation:\n   (X①2)②5 = (√X + 4) * 5\n\n3. Simplifying this expression:\n   (√X + 4) * 5 = 5√X + 20\n\n4. Now, we are given that this expression equals 35:\n   5√X + 20 = 35\n\n5. To isolate √X, subtract 20 from both sides:\n   5√X = 15\n\n6. Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for √X:\n   √X = 3\n\n7. Squaring both sides to solve for X:\n   X = 9\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n[[9]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "NULL", "response_origin": "My apologies, there seems to have been an error in my previous calculation.

Start by isolating (X①2):\n(X①2) = (35)②(1/5) (Undo the ②5 operation by dividing 35 by 5)\n\n2. Simplify the RHS of the equation from step 1:\n(X①2) = 7\n\n3. Now, we can solve for X using the definition of the custom operation ①:\nX①2 = 7\n\n\\sqrt{X} + 2^2 = 7\n\n4. Simplifying the equation in step 3:\n\\sqrt{X} = 7 - 4\n\\sqrt{X} = 3\n\n5.
