Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3.

Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (There is no letter J.Its row and column coordinates are between 0 and 4.):\n        - U  B  I  L  A\n        N  T  C  D  E\n        F  G  H  K  M\n        O  P  Q  R  S\n        V  W  X  Y  Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from plaintext.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n    - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"LXRPWXXKEAG\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"RWALHVXZEEZ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"WHFI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Thank you for your patience, and I apologize again for the previous mistakes."}}}
