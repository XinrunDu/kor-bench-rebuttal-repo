The subformula inside the negation is (~p1&p2).\n2. Taking the negation of (~p1&p2) results in ~(~p1&p2).\n3. The entire formula becomes ~(~p1&p2) or (||) ~p3.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n- For the entire formula to be false, both ~(~p1&p2) and ~p3 must be false.\n\n- ~p3 is false when p3 is true.\n- ~p1&p2 is true when both ~p1 and p2 are true, meaning p1 is false and p2 is true. Therefore, ~(~p1&p2) is false when p1 is false and p2 is true.\n\nThus, for ~(~p1&p2) to be false, p1 must be false and p2 must be true. Additionally, for ~p3 to be false, p3 must be true. \n\nTherefore, the false assignment for (1) is x|✓|✓.\n\n**Formula (2): (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)**\n\nDecomposing the formula:\n1. The left subformula is (~p2||p3).\n2. The right subformula is (p1=::>p2).\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n- For the entire formula to be false, one of the subformulas must be false.\n- (~p2||p3) is false when both ~p2 and p3 are false, which means p2 is true and p3 is false.\n- (p1=::>p2) is false only when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n\nConsidering these conditions:\n- To find a common assignment, note that (~p2||p3) requires p2 to be false (already conflicting with the required true for p2 in the first case).\n  \nAnalyzing each part separately:\n1. False assignments for (~p2||p3) are when p2 is true and p3 is false, ✓|x (not possible in conjunction with the second subformula requiring p2 false).\n2. (p1=::>p2) is false when p1 is true and p2 false, ✓|x.\n\nThus:\nValid assignments are x|✓|x, x|x|x satisfying both parts.\n\nTherefore, the false assignments for (2) is [✓|x|x, x|✓|x].\n\n**Formula (3): (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)**\n\nDecomposing the formula:\n1. The left subformula is (p1=::>p2).\n2. The right subformula is (~(p1&p3)||p1).\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n- For the entire formula to be false, one of the subformulas must be false.\n- (p1=::>p2) is false only when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n- (~(p1&p3)||p1) is false when both ~(p1&p3) and p1 are false. Thus the inner part would only be false when p1 and p3 holds. \n\nThus:\n- To get false, p1 must therefore be true and p3 false. This requires p1 is true, and p2 is false.\n\nAnalyzing condition:\n- To satisfy an overall false: p1 is true, p2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the false assignments for (3) are [✓|x|x] due to initial subsection.\n\n**The correct answer:**\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|x|x,x|✓|x];[F:✓|x|x]].\n"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x, x|✓|x];[F:✓|x|✓]]", "response_origin": "Let's evaluate the falsity values for each formula carefully.\n\n1) Formula: ~(~p1&p2)||~p3  \n   - The formula is false if both ~(~p1&p2) is false and ~p3 is false.\n   - ~(~p1&p2) is false when (~p1&p2) is true, i.e., when p1 is false and p2 is true.\n   - ~p3 is false when p3 is true.\n   - Therefore, falsity assignment: x|✓|✓\n\n2) Formula: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)  \n   - The formula is false if either ~p2||p3 is false or p1=::>p2 is false.\n   - ~p2||p3 is false when p2 is true and p3 is false.\n   - p1=::>p2 is false when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n   - Therefore, falsity assignments: ✓|✓|x, x|✓|x\n\n3) Formula: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)  \n   - The formula is false if either p1=::>p2 is false or ~(p1&p3)||p1 is false.\n   - p1=::>p2 is false when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n   - ~(p1&p3)||p1 is false when both ~(p1&p3) is false and p1 is false.\n   - ~(p1&p3) is false when (p1&p3) is true, i.e., both p1 is true and p3 is true.\n   - Therefore, falsity assignment: ✓|x|✓\n\nCombining these, the correct notation is:\n\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x, x|✓|x];[F:✓|x|✓]]"}, "3": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x, x|✓|x,✓|x|✓];[F:✓|x|x]]", "response_origin": "Let's review and correctly identify the false assignments for each formula:\n\n### Formula (1): `~(~p1&p2)||~p3`\nWe look for the truth values of propositions `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` that make the formula false.\n\nFirst, let's simplify:\n- Inside the inner parentheses `~p1&p2`, the formula is true when `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n- Thus, `~(¬p1&p2)` is false when `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n\nThe outer layer `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is false only when both `~(~p1&p2)` is false and `~p3` is false:\n- `~(¬p1&p2)` is false if `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n- `~p3` is false if `p3` is true.\n\nSo the combination making the formula false is:\n- `p1 = false (x)`\n- `p2 = true (✓)`\n- `p3 = true (✓)`\n\nFalsity Values: `x|✓|✓`\n\n### Formula (2): `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\nWe look for the truth values of propositions `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` that make the formula false.\n\nTo make an AND (`&`) formula false, at least one part must be false:\n\n- `(~p2||p3)` is false only if both `~p2` is false AND `p3` is false.\n  - `~p2` is false if `p2` is true.\n  - `p3` is false if `p3` is false.\n  Thus, `~p2||p3` is false if `p2 = true` and `p3 = false`.\n\n- `(p1=::>p2)` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false.\n  - `p1` true, `p2` false.\n\nCombining these conditions:\n1. `p2 = true` and `p3 = false`.

For \\(p1 =::> p2\\), it is false only when \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false (✓|x). Otherwise, it is true.\n2. \\(~(p1 =::> p2)\\) means us taking the negation:\n    - When \\(p1 =::> p2\\) is true, \\(~(p1 =::> p2)\\) is false.\n    - When \\(p1 =::> p2\\) is false (i.e., when \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false), \\(~(p1 =::> p2)\\) is true (✓|x).\n3. Let's combine this with \\(p2\\). The formula \\(~(p1=::>p2) & p2\\) is true only if both \\(~(p1=::>p2)\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is true:\n    - For \\(～(p1=::>p2) & p2\\) to be true, \\(p1=::> p2\\) has to be false, and \\(p2\\) has to be true.\n\nThus, there is no assignment making both \\(~(p1=::>p2)\\) true and \\(p2\\) true.

Start with the expression (p⇑q)⇑r.\n   By definition of ⇑ (NAND):\n   \\[\n   p ⇑ q ::=:: !p | !q \\quad \\text{(using rule 15)}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   (p⇑q) ⇑ r ::=:: (!p | !q) ⇑ r\n   \\]\n   Now, applying the definition of ⇑ again:\n   \\[\n   (!p | !q) ⇑ r ::=:: !((!p | !q) & r) \\quad \\text{(using rule 15)}\n   \\]\n   By De Morgan's law:\n   \\[\n   !((!p | !q) & r) ::=:: !(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: (!!p & !!q) | !r ::=:: (p & q) | !r\n   \\]\n\n2. Similarly, let's transform \\(p ⇑ (q⇑r)\\):\n   \\[\n   q ⇑ r ::=:: !q | !r \\quad \\text{(using rule 15)}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   p ⇑ (q⇑r) ::=:: p ⇑ (!q | !r)\n   \\]\n   Applying definition of ⇑ again:\n   \\[\n   p ⇑ (!q | !r) ::=:: !(p & (!q | !r)) \\quad \\text{(using rule 15)}\n   \\]\n   By distribution and De Morgan:\n   \\[\n   !(p & (!q | !r)) ::=:: !((p & !q) | ( p & !r )) ::=:: !p | !(p & !q | p & !r) ::=:: !p | ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to,\n   \\[\n   !p | q | r\n   \\]\n   \n3.

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]", "response_origin": "### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\nThe passage describes a process where the presence and absence of uranium (S) and the corresponding levels of radioactivity (P) were systematically studied. Initially, uranium was thought to cause the radioactivity, but further experiments showed that even after removing uranium, radioactivity persisted, leading to the conclusion that another element caused the radioactivity. This corresponds closely to the ꙮ method, where a positive group (experiments with uranium present) is compared to a negative group (experiments where uranium is absent), thus identifying a new causative factor (radium and polonium)."}, "1": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[D]]", "response_origin": "### Reasoning:\n\nLet's break down the causal derivation in the passage.\n\n- Original Case:\n    - The presence of uranium (S) and radioactivity (P) was observed. (Klaprozli's discovery)\n    - After uranium was extracted, radioactivity was still high, indicating another source (another element).\n\nThis demonstrates the observation that:\n- (1) S (Uranium)     P (Radioactivity)\n- (2) - (No Uranium)  P (Still Radioactivity)\n\nIn this sequence, we see that the presence or absence of Uranium doesn't change the radioactivity status. Therefore, the radioactivity is due to another factor when uranium is not present. This logical pattern aligns with observing a phenomenon under two different conditions (with and without factor S).\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- Method ☼ uses cases where the presence of S results in P, and its absence results in no P. This method does not apply as radioactivity persists regardless of the presence of Uranium.\n- Method ؆ uses the presence and absence of S corresponding to the presence or absence of P, but here P is still observed without S.\n- Method ꙮ involves examining positive and negative groups to determine the causal relationship when factors are varied systematically. This does not fit our scenario as we don't have various different cases compared.\n- Method ⵣ looks at corresponding changes in S and P, but here the constant variable P is unchanging whether S is there, indicating another cause.\n- Method ⚘ shows relationships between multiple known causal relationships to infer another, which isn't relevant to our simpler setup.\n\nHowever, the pattern follows Method ⵣ because:\n\n- The change/extraction of the substance (Factor S, Uranium) should result in a change (decreasing Radioactivity P) if Uranium was the cause. Yet, the radioactivity increased or persisted, thus implying another factor.\n\nRe-evaluating this passage according to the methods, the actual matching logical pattern adheres to Method ⵣ. They isolated another variable—radioactive elements (radium/polonium)—directly showing the causal change derived by detecting actual changes in the element properties (radioactivity) regardless of Uranium.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}, "2": {"prompt": "Your answer is incorrect, please check your answer and provide a correct one.", "response": "[[ꙮ]]", "response_origin": "[[ꙮ]]"}}}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. GB Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n- If hypothesis q_1 is assumed, then p.\n- If hypothesis q_2 is assumed, then p.\n- Since q_1 and q_2 are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, it is not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- p\n- q_1 → p\n- q_2 → p\n- q_1 ∧ q_2 → ⊥\n\n2. BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- R(a)∧B(a)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))≡∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))\n- ¬B(b)∧¬R(b)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]", "status": "correct"}
