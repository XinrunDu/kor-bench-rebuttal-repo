A conditional \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is false only when \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is false.\n   - **~(p1=::>p2)**: This negation is true only when \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is false, i.e., when \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is false.\n   - **~(p1=::>p2)&p2**: This conjunction is true only when both \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is true.\n\n2. **Possible assignments and their truth values:**\n   - \\( p1 = ✓, p2 = x \\): \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is false, so \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is true. But \\( p2 \\) is false, so \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false.\n   - \\( p1 = x, p2 = ✓ \\): \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is true, so \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false.\n   - \\( p1 = x, p2 = x \\): \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is true, so \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false.\n   - \\( p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓ \\): \\( p1=::>p2 \\) is true, so \\( ~(p1=::>p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion for Formula (1):**\n   - The formula \\( ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 \\) is false under all possible assignments. Therefore, it is a **Falsehood Formula**.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\n1. **Identify the subformulas and their assignments:**\n   - **(p1&p3)**: This conjunction is true only when both \\( p1 \\) and \\( p3 \\) are true.\n   - **(~p1&~p2)**: This conjunction is true only when both \\( p1 \\) and \\( p2 \\) are false.\n   - **(p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)**: This biconditional is true when both sides have the same truth value.\n\n2. **Possible assignments and their truth values:**\n   - \\( p1 = ✓, p3 = ✓, p2 = x \\): \\( (p1&p3) \\) is true and \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is false.\n   - \\( p1 = x, p3 = x, p2 = ✓ \\): \\( (p1&p3) \\) is false and \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) is true. Thus, \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is false.\n   - \\( p1 = ✓, p3 = x, p2 = x \\): \\( (p1&p3) \\) is false and \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is true.\n   - \\( p1 = x, p3 = ✓, p2 = ✓ \\): \\( (p1&p3) \\) is false and \\( (~p1&~p2) \\) is false. Thus, \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion for Formula (2):**\n   - The formula \\( (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) \\) is not always false under all assignments, nor is it always true. Therefore, it is **Neither**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[B];[C]]"}

For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad.

My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's apply Method C to the proposition \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\"\n\n### Step 1: Obversion\nFirst, we need to change the quality of the proposition (affirmative to negative or negative to affirmative) and replace the predicate with its contrary.\n\nOriginal Proposition: \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\"\nObverted Proposition: \"The ones who have left were not the ones who should have left.\"\n\n### Step 2: Conversion\nNext, we exchange the positions of the subject and predicate.\n\nObverted Proposition: \"The ones who have left were not the ones who should have left.\"\nConverted Proposition: \"The ones who should have left were not the ones who have left.\"\n\n### Final Result:\nUsing Method C, we get the following proposition:\n\n[[The ones who should have left were not the ones who have left.]]"}

This rule states that if a command `c` is subject to a resource limitation `R`, then `[ c ]φ` is equivalent to `(R ∧ [ c ]φ)`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[H]]."}

However, in the case of Neptune, the focus was not on differing conditions but on the deviation of Uranus's orbit.\n\n2. **Method ؆**:\n   - This method involves P occurring when S is present and not occurring when S is absent. In the case of Neptune, the deviation in Uranus's orbit (P) occurred when a gravitational force (S) was hypothesized to be present (the undiscovered planet). When this force was accounted for in calculations, the orbit deviation was resolved.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**:\n   - This method involves positive and negative groups. The positive group would be the presence of S causing P, and the negative group would be the absence of S causing no P. This does not clearly fit the discovery of Neptune, as it was not about the absence of the hypothesized planet.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**:\n   - This method involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. In the case of Neptune, changes in the hypothesized gravitational force (S) corresponded to changes in the observed deviation (P) of Uranus's orbit.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**:\n   - This method involves known causal relationships between certain elements leading to a deduced causal relationship. While the discovery of Neptune did involve prior knowledge of gravitational laws, it primarily involved predicting and observing the effects of a hypothesized gravitational force on Uranus's orbit.\n\nBased on the analysis, the discovery of Neptune aligns most closely with the **method ⵣ**, as it involved changes in the hypothesized gravitational force (S) corresponding to changes in the observed deviation (P) of Uranus's orbit.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's think step by step.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nThe passage describes the history and current status of deep wells and the use of underground water in Shanghai, and correlates the increase in deep wells and underground water usage with the increase in ground subsidence.\n\n1. **Method ⸮**: This method looks for cases where S and P occur together while other conditions differ. The passage does not focus on different conditions but rather on the direct correlation between the number of deep wells/water usage and ground subsidence.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method examines cases where P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. The passage does not provide clear evidence of P occurring in the absence of S.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This method compares a positive group (where S and P occur together) with a negative group (where S is absent and P is also absent). The passage does not provide a negative group where the absence of deep wells/water usage results in no ground subsidence.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method observes changes in S (number of deep wells/water usage) corresponding to changes in P (ground subsidence). The passage clearly shows that as the number of deep wells and water usage increased, so did the ground subsidence.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves known causal relationships between conditions A, B, C and X, Y, Z, leading to a conclusion about the relationship between S and P. The passage does not involve additional known causal relationships between other conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in the passage is consistent with **Method ⵣ** because it observes changes in the number of deep wells and underground water usage corresponding to changes in ground subsidence.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

Compare the given expression to the LS Paradox symbolic representation:\n   - The given expression ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥) indicates that the conjunction of r_1 and r_2 leads to a contradiction (⊥).\n   - This matches the condition in the LS Paradox where the conjunction of reasonable hypotheses leads to a contradiction.\n\nConclusion: The given logical expression does represent the LS Paradox.\n\nAnswer: [[A]]"}

The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n   - **Application:** C's statement is not necessarily minimalizing the information.

I need a definite answer.\"\nB: \"We have finished most of the work, with only a few details left to address.\"\nC: \"We have essentially wrapped up the project, with just some minor finishing touches remaining.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, A is requesting a definite answer about whether the project can be completed on time. B's response provides some information but does not directly answer A's question, instead implying that the project is nearly finished but there is still work to be done. C's response is similar to B's but uses the expression \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which may suggest that the project is substantially complete with only minor steps left. C's response might lead one to understand that although there are still parts of the project unfinished, the main work has been accomplished, and C has chosen a more euphemistic and optimistic way of expression, implying a high likelihood of project success while also leaving some openness, indicating there might be some unforeseen work left.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA.

They both provide information about the project's status but do not directly answer whether it will be completed on time. This does not clearly align with the C* Principle.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: The speaker should speak minimally to achieve communication purposes.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: Assume the relationship between objects and time follows convention unless otherwise specified.\n\n   B and C both provide information in a minimal manner, focusing on what is necessary to convey the project's status without directly answering the question about timing.

The statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" suggests that Zhang San has a car and there is a problem with the door.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The inference that \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is derived from the statement about the door not closing, which implies the existence of doors. This aligns with the CQ1 inference where the speaker knows the weaker information (door won't close) and implies the stronger information (the car has doors) cannot be established.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: This principle focuses on minimalization, speaking as little as possible. The statement is concise and does not provide unnecessary information.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The inference that \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is derived from the minimal information provided, which aligns with CI1 and CI2.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions. The statement is straightforward and does not use complex language.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The inference is straightforward and does not require complex interpretation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement and its inference fit well with both the C* Principle and the C% Principle. The C* Principle is more directly applicable because it deals with the speaker's knowledge and the inference about the stronger information (doors). The C% Principle also fits as it involves minimalization and inference from minimal information.\n\nGiven the direct alignment with the C* Principle in terms of knowledge and inference, the answer is:\n\n[[A]]"}

(Common sense inference type)\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **C* Principle**:\n   - This principle involves information strength and entailment. The statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" does not directly entail \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" based on information strength, but rather involves a common sense inference about the majority of nurses being female.\n   - **CQ1**: The speaker does not necessarily know that the stronger information (Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female) cannot be established, as this is a common sense inference rather than a direct entailment.\n   - **CQ2**: The speaker does not state \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" with the intention of avoiding knowledge about the gender of the nurse, so this inference does not fit well with CQ2.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle involves minimalization and convention. The statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" is minimal and uses convention to infer that the nurse is likely female, which aligns with the minimalization criterion.\n   - **CI1**: The relationship between the objects (Xiao Wang and nurse) follows the convention that nurses are often female, which fits the CI1 inference.\n   - **CI2**: The existence or fact (nurse) exactly matches the confirmed situation (likely female), which fits the CI2 inference.\n\n3. **C!

Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Can you help me borrow the materials for tomorrow's meeting?\"\nB: \"I borrowed the materials.\"\nC: \"I managed to get the materials.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, B's response \"I borrowed the materials\" is a direct and conventional answer, indicating that B has successfully completed the action of borrowing the materials. However, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" uses the word \"managed,\" which may imply that the process of obtaining the materials was not simple and may involve additional effort or the use of some special methods. C's response may lead people to understand that the process of obtaining the materials was \"quite troublesome,\" or C encountered some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze the response of C in the context of the given principles:\n\n1. **C* Principle**:\n   - This principle deals with the strength of information provided by the speaker. If C's response were to conform to this principle, it would mean that C is either providing the weakest information possible without contradicting stronger information or implying that they know stronger information cannot be established. However, C's response does not clearly indicate that they are withholding stronger information or that they know stronger information is unavailable.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle involves minimalization, where the speaker speaks as little as necessary. C's response could be seen as minimalistic because it does not provide unnecessary details about the process of obtaining the materials. However, the word \"managed\" introduces a nuance that suggests the process was not straightforward, thus adding more information than strictly necessary.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - This principle is about using marked expressions. A marked expression is one that deviates from the conventional or standard way of expressing something. In this case, \"I managed to get the materials\" is a marked expression because it deviates from the conventional \"I borrowed the materials.\" The use of \"managed\" implies that there was some difficulty or effort involved, which is not conveyed by the simpler, unmarked expression.\n\nGiven the analysis, C's response conforms to the **C! Principle** because it uses a marked expression (the word \"managed\") that implies additional information beyond what a conventional response would convey.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]"}

Copernicus was 38 when he proposed the heliocentric theory; Newton and Leibniz were 22 and 28 respectively when they invented calculus; Darwin was 22 during his global voyage and later wrote the famous \"On the Origin of Species\"; Edison was 29 when he invented the phonograph and 31 when he invented the light bulb; Bell was 29 when he invented the telephone; The Curies discovered the radioactivity of thorium, polonium, and radium at the age of 31, won their first Nobel Prize, and later discovered two new elements, winning a second Nobel Prize at the age of 46; Einstein was only 26 when he proposed the special theory of relativity and 37 when he proposed the general theory of relativity; Lee and Yang were 30 and 34 respectively when they proposed the law of parity non-conservation in weak interactions. Natural science is like this, and many outstanding social scientists and politicians have also basically created their outstanding achievements from a young age.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze the given passage step by step to determine the appropriate argumentation method.\n\n1. **Direct Argumentation Methods**:\n   - **E+ Method**: This method uses specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition. The passage provides specific examples of scientists, mathematicians, and other notable figures who made significant contributions during their prime. These examples are used to support the proposition that important inventions and creations are often made during one's prime.\n   - **Syl+ Method**: This method uses universal propositions as premises and supports conclusions through syllogistic reasoning. The passage does not explicitly use syllogistic reasoning but rather presents specific examples.\n   - **Metaph+ Method**: This method uses metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic. The passage does not use metaphors but rather factual examples.\n\n2. **Indirect Argumentation Methods**:\n   - **Contra- Method**: This method indirectly confirms the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition. The passage does not refute any contrary proposition but rather presents examples directly supporting the proposition.\n   - **Elim- Method**: This method indirectly determines the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities related to the original proposition as false. The passage does not eliminate other possibilities but rather presents specific examples as evidence.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage uses specific instances (examples) to argue for the truth of the proposition that important inventions and creations are often made during one's prime.

NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD. IncorrNeg Method\nE. DisjSyl Method\nF. QuantSwitch Method\nG. IllTrans Method\nH. IncorrInf Method\nI. InvSubError Method\nJ. LetClauseShift Method\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Original Statement**: \"All employees (E) will receive a bonus (B) after completing a project (P).\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: ∀E (P → B).\n\n2. **Misunderstood Statement**: \"only when an employee receives a bonus (B) have they completed a project (P).\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: ∀E (B → P).\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The original statement says: If an employee completes a project, then they will receive a bonus. (P → B)\n   - The misunderstood statement says: If an employee receives a bonus, then they have completed a project. (B → P)\n\n4. **Type of Fallacy**:\n   - This is a case where the conditional statement has been incorrectly flipped. The employee incorrectly believes that if B is true (receiving a bonus), then P must be true (project completion).\n\nBased on the Custom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules, this corresponds to the **CondSwap Method**: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]"}
