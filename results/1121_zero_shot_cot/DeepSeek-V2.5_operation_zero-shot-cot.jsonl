This can be either `X` (if `X` is greater than or equal to 10) or `10` (if `10` is greater than `X`).\n   - For `(4 $ 2)`, we need to select the smaller of `4` and `2`. This will always be `2`.\n\n3. **Simplify the equation:**\n   - The equation becomes: `(X § 10) / 2 = 5`.\n\n4. **Solve the equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate `(X § 10)`: `(X § 10) = 10`.\n\n5. **Interpret the result:**\n   - Since `(X § 10) = 10`, this means the larger of `X` and `10` is `10`.\n   - Therefore, `X` must be less than or equal to `10`.\n\n6. **Formulate the inequality:**\n   - The inequality is `X ≤ 10`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[X ≤ 10]]"}

We start with the given equation: \\( 3¥X¥6 = -1 \\).\n\n2. According to the defined operation rule \\( a¥b = a^b - b^a \\), we first need to express \\( 3¥X \\) in terms of this rule:\n   \\[\n   3¥X = 3^X - X^3\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we substitute \\( 3¥X \\) into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   (3^X - X^3)¥6 = -1\n   \\]\n\n4. Applying the operation rule again to \\( (3^X - X^3)¥6 \\):\n   \\[\n   (3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{3^X - X^3} = -1\n   \\]\n\n5. We need to find \\( X \\) such that the above equation holds true. Let's test some values of \\( X \\) to find a consistent solution.\n\n6. Testing \\( X = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   3^2 = 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2^3 = 8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3¥2 = 9 - 8 = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1¥6 = 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5 \\quad \\text{(does not equal -1)}\n   \\]\n\n7. Testing \\( X = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3^3 = 27 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3¥3 = 27 - 27 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   0¥6 = 0^6 - 6^0 = 0 - 1 = -1 \\quad \\text{(equals -1)}\n   \\]\n\n8.
