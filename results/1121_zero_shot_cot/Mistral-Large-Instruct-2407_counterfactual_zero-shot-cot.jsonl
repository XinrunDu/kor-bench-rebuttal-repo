The first English speaker to land on the American continent:\n- This person would face significant language barriers, as there would be no common language with the indigenous population. However, over time, communication could be established through learning each other's languages or developing a basic form of communication.\n\nC. Crazy Dave who slurs:\n- Crazy Dave has a unique language understood only by his talking car, Penny. This creates a substantial communication barrier as no one else can comprehend him without Penny's interpretation.\n\nD. Dancing Zombie conjuring dancer zombies through his movements:\n- The Dancing Zombie communicates through dance, which is a non-verbal form of communication. While this is unconventional, dance can still convey messages and emotions, and others might understand the intent through observation and interpretation.\n\nConsidering the options, Crazy Dave faces the most significant communication difficulty because his speech is not understandable by those around him without the assistance of his talking car, Penny.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[C]]"}

This implies that quantum entanglement allows for instantaneous information transfer, overcoming the limitations of traditional communication methods.\n\n2. **The Speed of Light:**\n   - Communication at the speed of light is fast but still subject to the delays inherent in the distance between the points of communication. For example, a message sent from Proxima Centauri to Earth would take 4.2 years to arrive.\n\n3. **Radio Waves:**\n   - Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that travel at the speed of light. They are widely used for communication, but they are subject to the same delays as any other method operating at the speed of light.\n\n4. **Letter:**\n   - A letter is a physical form of communication that relies on transportation methods such as mail or courier services.

This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards.

That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the conditions for superconductivity to be realized?(answer with one option)\nOptions:A.

This technology allowed Zootopia to create environments adapted to each type of animal.\nThese eco-zones are also recyclable ecosystems, with the creators designing the walls of the tundra city as giant air conditioners with air vents that simultaneously heat the Sahara Plaza, so that if the snow and ice melt, then the rainforest areas can be nourished\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups has matching personalities and occupations?\n(answer with one option)\nOptions:A. cats, who are independent, as pacifiers; ##B. shrews, who have small bodies, as mob bosses ##C.

Wood resources are not infinite.\n\nOption C: \"After large-scale logging in a forest, some trees are likely to turn into Treeguards.\"\n- This statement is related to the story's context but does not pertain to sustainable development. Treeguards are fictional elements specific to the game and not a realistic scenario.\n\nOption D: \"Large-scale logging of trees may lead to soil erosion.\"\n- This statement is correct.

The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

This dragon can curl itself into a ball, just like an armadillo and can smash itself against the ground. This dragon also strong enough to crash rocks with its body as it curls like a ball. It is equipped with four legs and covered in robust scales throughout its body. Their height is about 50-60 feet, their width is about 30-45 feet and length is 55 feet.\nThis is Berk. It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word: sturdy. It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n\n### Question:\nWhen certain animals come into contact with certain plants, they may exhibit certain reactions. Which statement about these plants is correct?\nOptions: A.Catnip has a strong attraction that about 99% of cats have toward it.##B.Catnip has a history of use in traditional medicine for a variety of ailments such as stomach cramps, indigestion, fevers, hives, and nervous conditions.##C.The Dragon Nip has the magic power to make all dragons relax.##D.One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " The story provides specific details about the effects of Dragon Nip on dragons.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen.

Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship.

The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure.

However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nWhich statement about artificial biosphere technology is correct?\nOptions: A.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public.

The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel.

Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044.

However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel.

That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the Transformers universe, the origins of the Autobots and Decepticons trace back to their home planet Cybertron, a metallic world inhabited by sentient robots capable of transformation. Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King. It features icy plains, towering fortresses, and is the setting for the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion.\nPandaria, inspired by East Asian aesthetics, is a serene and beautiful land inhabited by the Pandaren and was introduced in the \"Mists of Pandaria\" expansion.\nThe Alliance, known for its principles of honor and justice, is composed of the Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and the enigmatic Pandaren. Each race has a distinct narrative that shapes its unique characteristics.Leaders in the Alliance are often chosen based on heritage, valor, or notable achievements rather than democratic elections. \nHumans, the most versatile of the races, hail from the kingdom of Stormwind and are known for their resilience and determination. The architecture of human cities, primarily consisting of medieval castles and fortifications. The Night Elves, one of the oldest races in Azeroth, have a deep affinity with nature and magic. The Moon Festival is an important event in the culture of the Night Elves, celebrating their connection to the moon and their ancestors.
