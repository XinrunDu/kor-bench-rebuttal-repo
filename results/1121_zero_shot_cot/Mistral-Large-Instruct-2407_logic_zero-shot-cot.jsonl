Let's evaluate each sub-question step by step.\n\n#### Sub-question (1): \\( p ::=:: (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) \\)\n\n1. Start with the right-hand side: \\( (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) \\).\n2. Apply the distributive property (Rule 5):\n   \\[\n   (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) ::=:: p \\& (q | !q)\n   \\]\n3.

Simplify using \\( p \\& 1 ::=:: p \\):\n   \\[\n   p \\& 1 ::=:: p\n   \\]\n\nSince the right-hand side simplifies to \\( p \\), we have shown that \\( p ::=:: (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) \\) is valid.\n\n#### Sub-question (2): \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::=:: (p | q) \\& !(p | q) \\)\n\n1. Start with the left-hand side: \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) \\).\n2. Apply the distributive property (Rule 5):\n   \\[\n   (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::=:: (p | !p) \\& (p | q) \\& (!q | !p) \\& (!q | q)\n   \\]\n3. Simplify using \\( p | !p ::=:: 1 \\) and \\( q | !q ::=:: 1 \\) (Rule 8):\n   \\[\n   (p | !p) \\& (p | q) \\& (!q | !p) \\& (!q | q) ::=:: 1 \\& (p | q) \\& 1 \\& 1\n   \\]\n4. Simplify further:\n   \\[\n   1 \\& (p | q) \\& 1 \\& 1 ::=:: (p | q)\n   \\]\n\nNow, consider the right-hand side: \\( (p | q) \\& !(p | q) \\).\n\n1. Apply De Morgan's law (Rule 6):\n   \\[\n   !(p | q) ::=:: !p \\& !q\n   \\]\n2. Substitute back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   (p | q) \\& !(p | q) ::=:: (p | q) \\& (!p \\& !q)\n   \\]\n3. Apply the distributive property (Rule 5):\n   \\[\n   (p | q) \\& (!p \\& !q) ::=:: (p \\& !p) \\& (q \\& !q) \\& (p \\& !q) \\& (q \\& !p)\n   \\]\n4. Simplify using \\( p \\& !p ::=:: 0 \\) and \\( q \\& !q ::=:: 0 \\) (Rule 9):\n   \\[\n   (p \\& !p) \\& (q \\& !q) \\& (p \\& !q) \\& (q \\& !p) ::=:: 0 \\& 0 \\& (p \\& !q) \\& (q \\& !p) ::=:: 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side simplifies to \\( 0 \\), which does not match the left-hand side. Thus, the equivalence \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::=:: (p | q) \\& !(p | q) \\) is not valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- For sub-question (1): \\( p ::=:: (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) \\) is valid.\n- For sub-question (2): \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::=:: (p | q) \\& !(p | q) \\) is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\\[ [[A];[B]] \\]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To determine the validity of the given equivalences, we'll apply the specified logical rules and equivalences.\n\n**Sub-question (1)**: `((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))`\n\n1. Using equivalence rule (10):\n   - \\( A > B ::=:: !A | B \\)\n   - So, \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - And, \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   (p > q) & (p > r) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n   \\]\n\n3. Using equivalence rule (5):\n   - \\( A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C) \\)\n   - Here, \\( A = !p \\), \\( B = q \\), and \\( C = r \\)\n   - So, \\( (!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r) \\)\n\n4. Thus:\n   \\[\n   (p > q) & (p > r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n   \\]\n\n5. We need to check if this is equivalent to \\( p > (q | r) \\):\n   - Using rule (10):\n     \\[\n     p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r)\n     \\]\n\n6. Notice:\n   \\[\n   !p | (q & r) \\neq !p | (q | r)\n   \\]\n\nHence, the equivalence does not hold for sub-question (1).\n\n**Sub-question (2)**: `!(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)`\n\n1. Using equivalence rule (11):\n   - \\( A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A) \\)\n   - So, \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n\n2. Using rule (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( q > p ::=:: !q | p \\)\n\n3. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   p = q ::=:: (!p | q) & (!q | p)\n   \\]\n\n4. The negation:\n   \\[\n   !(p = q) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\n   \\]\n\n5. Using equivalence rule (6):\n   - \\( !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B \\)\n   - So:\n     \\[\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(p | q) | !(!q | p)\n     \\]\n   ```\n6. Using equivalence rule (9):\n   - \\( A & !A ::=:: 0 \\) can help simplify \\( !(!q | p) \\)\n   - Hence \\( !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !((p & q)) \\)\n\nThe equivalence holds for sub-question (2).\n\n### Conclusion:\n```\n[[B];[A]]\n```"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To determine where Professor Wang is from and who among the attendees got everything right, got half right, and got everything wrong, we can use the propositional logic given by the problem statement and translate the conditions into logical expressions.\n\nGiven the definitions:\n- \\( p \\): Professor Wang is from Suzhou.\n- \\( q \\): Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n- \\( r \\): Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\n\nAnd the conditions:\n- Exactly one of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), \\( r \\) is true, and the other two are false.\n- Each person's statements represented as:\n  - Person A: \\( !p \\& q \\)\n  - Person B: \\( p \\& !q \\)\n  - Person C: \\( !q \\& !r \\)\n\nFrom Professor Wang's remarks, one is entirely correct, one is half correct, and one is entirely incorrect. This leads to the representation of logical expressions for each scenario:\n\n- B1: \\( !p \\& q \\) (Person A is entirely correct)\n- B2: \\( (!p \\& !q) | (p \\& q) \\) (Person A is partially correct)\n- B3: \\( p \\& !q \\) (Person A is entirely incorrect)\n\n- C1: \\( p \\& !q \\) (Person B is entirely correct)\n- C2: \\( (p \\& q) | (!p \\& !q) \\) (Person B is partially correct)\n- C3: \\( !p \\& q \\) (Person B is entirely incorrect)\n\n- D1: \\( !q \\& !r \\) (Person C is entirely correct)\n- D2: \\( (!q \\& r) | (q \\& !r) \\) (Person C is partially correct)\n- D3: \\( q \\& r \\) (Person C is entirely incorrect)\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression is:\n\\[ E = (B1 \\& C2 \\& D3) | (B1 \\& C3 \\& D2) | (B2 \\& C1 \\& D3) | (B2 \\& C3 \\& D1) | (B3 \\& C1 \\& D2) | (B3 \\& C2 \\& D1) \\]\n\nGiven \\( E ::=:: (!p \\& q \\& !r) | (p \\& !q \\& r) \\),\n\nWe need to find which one of \\((!p \\& q \\& !r)\\) or \\((p \\& !q \\& r)\\) reflect the truth of exactly one of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\) being true:\n\n1. \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\): This means that Professor Wang is from Shanghai only.\n2. \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\): This means that Professor Wang is from Suzhou only.\n\nThus:\n\n- If \\( E ::=:: !p \\& q \\& !r \\) is true:\n  - Professor Wang is from Shanghai (\\(!p, q, !r\\)).\n  - Person A is entirely correct.\n  - Person B is partially correct.\n  - Person C is entirely incorrect.\n\n- If \\( E ::=:: p \\& !q \\& r \\) is true:\n  - Professor Wang is from Suzhou (\\(p, !q, !r\\)).\n  - Person A is half correct.\n  - Person B is entirely correct.\n  - Person C is entirely incorrect.\n\nThose satisfy that exactly one of \\(p, q, r\\) is true would actually exclude the latter logical construction \\(p & !q & r\\), realizing the correct solution here has to be:\n\n\\[ [[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: B]; [entirely incorrect: C]] \\]\n\nThis simplifies to the infos needed:\n[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: B]; [entirely incorrect: C]]."}

We start by identifying the true assignment of ¬p∧¬q∧¬r. This formula is true when p = 0, q = 0, and r = 0.\n\n2. The corresponding binary number for the true assignment (000) is 000 in binary, which is 0 in decimal and 0 in hexadecimal.\n\n3. According to the given rule, a formula whose true assignment corresponds to hexadecimal 0 is denoted as m0.\n\n4. Given that ¬p∧¬q∧¬r corresponds to m0, it follows that this formula is a basic formula.\n\n5. As for being an all-even formula or an all-odd formula, since 0 is even, it satisfies the condition for an all-even formula but not for an all-odd formula.\n\n6. To determine if it is a tautology, contradiction, or none of the above, we need to check:\n    - A tautology would require the PDNF to include all 2^n (where n is the number of variables) paired conjunctive terms. Here, n = 3, so 2^3 = 8 paired conjunctive terms. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r only corresponds to one term, it is not a tautology.\n    - A contradiction would have no paired conjunctive terms in its PDNF. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r corresponds to at least one term (m0), it is not a contradiction.\n\nGiven the analysis, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is:\n- A basic formula (since it corresponds to m0).\n- An all-even formula (since 0 is even).\n\n### Answer:\n[[C, D]]"}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To determine the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said, we first need to translate their statements into the logical forms specified by the rule.\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes. (Universal Negative, E)\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes. (Particular Affirmative, I)\n\nAccording to the relationships defined in the logic rule:\n\n- The relationship between Universal Negative (E) and Particular Affirmative (I) is a * Relation.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said is [[*]]."}

However, Method A does not change the position of the subject and predicate.\n     - It is not applicable because it does not produce a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.\n\n   - **Method B**: This exchanges the positions of the subject and predicate.\n     - It is not directly applicable to a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A).\n\n   - **Method C**: This first performs obversion, then performs conversion.\n     - It involves two steps:\n       1. Obversion: Change \"All S is P\" to \"No S is not P.\"\n       2. Conversion: Change \"No S is not P\" to \"No non-P is not S,\" which can be rephrased as \"All non-P is S.\"\n\n   For the given proposition \"All correct reasoning (S) is formally correct reasoning (P)\":\n   - Apply Method C:\n     1. Obversion: \"No correct reasoning (S) is not formally correct reasoning (P)\"\n     2. Conversion: \"No non-formally correct reasoning (non-P) is not correct reasoning (S)\" which simplifies to \"All non-formally correct reasoning (non-P) is not correct reasoning (S).\"\n\n   This results in a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as a component, though it is not directly formulated with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.\n\n   Therefore, careful consideration must be taken to ensure the method matches the requirement exactly: \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.\n\n   **Conclusion**:\n\nSince Method C involves obversion and conversion, and though it manipulates the components of the proposition, it does not directly produce a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject as needed. Hence, the proper method to infer with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject specifically is **Method A** because it directly handles the Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) by changing its quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary, though it does not exchange subjects and predicates.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[C]]"}

Hence, this method does not fit.\n\n2. **Method ؆**:\n   - This method requires that P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent.\n   - The discourse mentions that the high yield occurs when Chinese hybrid rice varieties are used and not when American rice varieties are used.\n   - This fits the scenario well since:\n     - (1) S A B     P (Chinese hybrid rice varieties yield high harvest)\n     - (2) - A B     - (American rice varieties do not yield high harvest)\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**:\n   - This method requires both positive and negative groups where S and P occur together in the positive group and are absent in the negative group.\n   - The discourse does not clearly distinguish between positive and negative groups; thus, this method does not fit.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**:\n   - This method requires that changes in S correspond to changes in P.\n   - While there are changes in the yield across years, the primary focus is not on the changes but on the consistent high yield when Chinese hybrid rice varieties are used. This method does not fit the given scenario well.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**:\n   - This method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of properties.\n   - The discourse does not involve multiple pairs of properties with known causal relationships, so this method does not fit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most fitting method for deriving the causality in the discourse is Method ؆, where the high yield of rice (P) occurs when Chinese hybrid rice varieties (S) are used and does not occur when American rice varieties are used.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " The passage describes a scenario where changes in the number of deep wells (S) correspond to changes in the amount of ground subsidence (P).

Their reasoning was as follows: On land, there is air and sunlight, most organisms rely on these resources for growth and reproduction; in the deep sea, there is a lack of sunlight, extreme pressure, and low temperatures, most terrestrial organisms cannot survive in such extreme environments.\n\nThis reasoning follows the ⌘ Method, where \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is what kind of attribute?\nA. -⌘ attribute  B. +⌘ attribute\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To determine the type of attribute \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is, we need to analyze the reasoning provided.\n\n1. The reasoning compares deep-sea creatures with terrestrial life.\n2. On land (Object A), there is air and sunlight, and most organisms rely on these for growth and reproduction.\n3. In the deep sea (Object B), there is a lack of sunlight, extreme pressure, and low temperatures, and most terrestrial organisms cannot survive.\n\nThe form of reasoning used is that because deep-sea creatures lack certain conditions found on land (air and sunlight), they also lack the environmental suitability for terrestrial organisms.\n\nAccording to the ⌘ Method:\n- Object A (land) has attributes a, b, c, d.\n- Object B (deep sea) does not have attributes a, b, c.\n- Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d.\n\nHere:\n- The attributes \"the presence of air and sunlight\" are being considered as -⌘ attributes (a, b, c) in the ⌘ Method.\n- Since these attributes are absent in the deep sea, they are -⌘ attributes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[A]]."}

In this context, C’s response using the word \"managed\" could be interpreted as providing additional information about the effort involved, which the simpler statement \"I borrowed the materials\" does not convey. However, this principle is not directly invoked because it does not depend on contrasting strength of information in this specific dialogue.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle emphasizes minimalizing words and assuming conventional relationships unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. B’s response fits this criterion as it is simple and direct. C’s response, however, deviates from minimalization by adding \"managed,\" indicating a more complex or effortful process.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - This principle involves avoiding lengthy or marked expressions unless there is a specific reason. C’s response uses the marked expression \"managed,\" which implies additional effort or special methods, differing from the more straightforward phrase used by B. This deviation from conventional minimal expression fits the C! Principle, where using a marked expression indicates a specific reason or additional meaning.\n\nBased on the analysis, the principle that fits C’s response is the C!

Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " The provided definition of \"Internet\" explains the term by describing its origin and evolution, specifically mentioning that it is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" This aligns with the ℓ Definition, which explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}
