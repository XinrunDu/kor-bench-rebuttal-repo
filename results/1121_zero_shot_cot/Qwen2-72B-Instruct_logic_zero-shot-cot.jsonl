The outer negation indicates that for the compound proposition to be true, everything inside must be false. This means p1&p2&~p3 must be false. As we know, an \"and\" is false if any of its components is false.\n\nTo make p1&p2&~p3 false:\n- Either p1 is false (x),\n- Or p2 is false (x),\n- Or p3 is true (✓).\n\nSince there are multiple ways the inner formula can be false (in fact, any of the conditions listed makes it false), any assignment that includes any one of these will make the whole formula true. However, the formula will be false if all of p1, p2 are true AND p3 is false.\n\nTruth assignments:\n- Any combination of x|x|x,\n- Any combination that includes p1 as false,\n- Any combination that includes p2 as false,\n- Any combination that includes p3 as true.\n\nFalse assignments:\nT: x|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓; F: ✓|✓|x\n\n(2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nWe tackle the formula ~p1&p2=::>(p1=p3) using the rules. This formula will be false when the left side (premise) is true and the right side (conclusion) is false.\n\nFirst, let us examine the conditions under which ~p1&p2 is true:\n- This requires that p1 is false (x) AND p2 is true (✓).\n\nNow, (p1=p3) is true if:\n- p1 and p3 have the same truth value.\n\nGiven that, the whole formula is false if ~p1&p2 is true (i.e., p1 is false AND p2 is true) AND p1=p3 is false. Therefore, the formula is false when p1 is false AND p2 is true, AND p3 is true (because for p1=p3 to be false, p3 must have a different truth value than p1).\n\nTruth assignments: \n(a) If ~p1&p2 is false and p1=p3 is either true or false, the formula always holds true since the conditional becomes vacuously true when the premise is false.\n(b) If p1=p3 is true and ~p1&p2 is true, the formula also holds true.\n\nFalse assignments: \n- Only when the premise is true and the conclusion is false.\n\nT: (All cases except when p1 is false, p2 is true, and p3 is true)\nF: x|✓|✓\n\nTo summarize:\n\nAnswer: \n[[T: x|x|✓, x|x|✓, x|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓, ✓|✓|✓, ✓|✓|✓; \n  F: ✓|✓|x]]; \n[T: (All cases except when p1 is false, p2 is true, and p3 is true); \n  F: x|✓|✓]]\n\nLet's adjust the above truth assignments for simplification. \n\nAnswer:\n[[T: x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓; \nF: ✓|✓|x]]; \n[[T: ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓, ✓|x|x, x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|x|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|✓|x; \nF: x|✓|✓]]\n\nHowever, this format can still be optimized by removing redundant assignments (due to symmetry and the logic of \"=\"), which indicates equivalent truth values under different but logically equivalent propositions.\n\nFinal Answer:\n[[T: x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓;\nF: ✓|✓|x]];\n[[T: ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓, x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓;\nF: x|✓|✓]]\n\nAny redundancy can be further reduced based on noticing equivalent assignments due to the symmetry and the logic of \"=\". For instance, if (p1=p3) can be true, then any combination where p1 is equivalent to p3 would yield a true statement given the left side of the condition is either false or meets a condition where (p1=p3) holds true as the right side of the condition. The truth assignments for the second formula would thus be any combination that does not make the conditional false, i.e., any assignment where (p1=p3) holds any value other than false when ~p1&p2 is true. But to keep this answer to a rigid format as asked by your question, we delineate all possible combinations less the redundant ones that don't change the respective truth value of the formulas (understanding that any case that does not explicitly appear in the 'false' condition automatically falls under a 'true' condition by virtue of deductive logic and the given rules). Thus, the offered final answer attempts to adhere as strictly as possible to the specified form while removing cases that would otherwise be redundantly included under the same truth conditions. \n\n[[T: x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓;\nF: ✓|✓|x]];\n[[T: ✓|x|x, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓, ✓|✓|✓, x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓, x|✓|✓;\nF: x|✓|✓]].\n\nHowever, applying the simplification rules, we can optimize the above further and remove redundant expressions.\n\n[[T: x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓;\nF: ✓|✓|x]];\n[[T: ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓, x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓;\nF: x|✓|✓]]\n\nAt this final stage, redundancy is minimized, and every listed assignment holds true or false values conclusively following the given ruleset. Completing the designated format exactly as required, with true and false assignments for each formula delineated comprehensively: \n\n[[T: x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓;\nF: ✓|✓|x]];\n[[T: ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓, x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓;\nF: x|✓|✓]]"}

We will break down each formula, considering the priority of logical connectives, and find the false assignments based on the propositions' truth values.\n\n1. **Formula (1):** \n   \\[\n   ~(~p1 \\& p2) || ~p3\n   \\]\n   This formula evaluates to false when both parts of the disjunction are false:\n   - \\(~(~p1 \\& p2)\\) is false.\n   - \\(~p3\\) is false.\n   \n   Therefore, \\(~p3\\) must be false, so \\(p3\\) is true (\\(✓\\)). \\(~(~p1 \\& p2)\\) is false if \\(~p1 \\& p2\\) is true. This is true if \\(~p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is true. However, since \\(~p1\\) being true means \\(p1\\) is false (\\(x\\)), we determine that \\(p1\\) must be false and \\(p2\\) must be true for this part of the formula to contribute to the falsity. Thus, the falsity value is:\n   \\[\n   F:x|✓|✓\n   \\]\n\n2. **Formula (2):** \n   \\[\n   (~p2 || p3) \\& (p1 =::> p2)\n   \\]\n   This formula evaluates to false when either part of the conjunction is false:\n   - \\((~p2 || p3)\\) is false.\n   - \\((p1 =::> p2)\\) is false.\n   \n   \\((p1 =::> p2)\\) can only be false when \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false (as per the definition of the implication connective). For \\((~p2 || p3)\\) to be false, both \\(~p2\\) and \\(p3\\) must be false; thus, \\(p2\\) must be true, and \\(p3\\) must be false (\\(x\\)). But this conflicts with the requirement for \\((p1 =::> p2)\\) to be false: to satisfy both conditions simultaneously for the formula to be false, \\(p1\\) must be true, \\(p2\\) must be false (for the implication to fail), and \\(p3\\) must be anything (as \\(p3\\) does not come into play when \\(p2\\) is false in the \\((~p2 || p3)\\) part). However, this combination does not satisfy the disjunction, meaning we focus on when \\((p1 =::> p2)\\) is false. Therefore, the falsity value is:\n   \\[\n   F:✓|x|x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Formula (3):** \n   \\[\n   (p1 =::> p2) \\& (~ (p1 \\& p3) || p1)\n   \\]\n   Although the formula seems complicated, given priority of operators, \\(p1 =::> p2\\) can only be false if \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false. For the second part of the conjunction, we observe \\(~ (p1 \\& p3)\\), which means \\(p1\\) and \\(p3\\) cannot both be true for this not to hold true. Thus, the falsity value largely hinges on the first half of the conjunction, i.e., the implication. For \\(p1 =::> p2\\) to be false, \\(p1\\) must be true and \\(p2\\) must be false. The remainder of the formula includes a disjunction that includes \\(p1\\) being true, thus, making it automatically true. Thus, to make the entire formula false, we must negate \\((p1 =::> p2)\\), meaning the falsity value is:\n   \\[\n   F:✓|x|x\n   \\]\n\n### Answer:\n\\[\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|x|x];[F:✓|x|x]]\n\\]"}

Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are equivalent, we will use the given logic rules to simplify both expressions.\n\nFirst, let's simplify (p>q)>r:\n1. (p>q)>r\n2. By rule (10), replace p>q with !p|q: (!(!p|q))|r\n3. Using rule (1), double negation cancels: (!p|q)|r\n4. Using rule (10) in reverse for >, rewrite as: (!p|q)>!r\n5. Apply rule (12) to the right side as !(!r) is r: (!p|q)>r\n6. This is similar to one part of rule (10): p>(q>r).\n\nNow, let's simplify p>(q>r):\n1. p>(q>r)\n2. Apply rule (10) to q>r: p>(!q|r)\n3. Apply rule (10) for the entire expression: !(p) | (!q|r)\n4. Simplify using rule (3): (!p | !q) | r\n5. Using rule (16) for ⇑, this can be rewritten as: (!p)⇑(!q) | r\n6. Using rule (15), ⇑ can be reinterpreted as: (!p | !q) | r\n7. Apply rule (4) for associative property: !p | (!q | r)\n\nAt this point, we see that from expression (p>q)>r, when simplifying, we end up with something similar to the simplified form of p>(q>r), which is:\n(p>q)>r simplifies to: (!p|q)>r\np>(q>r) becomes: !p | (!q | r)\n\nThese two expressions look different due to our simplification steps. We need to further reduce both forms to their simplest equivalent using the rules provided.\n\nGiven the final simplified expressions, let's make a direct comparison:\n1. (!p|q)>r vs. !p | (!q | r)\n\nExamining both simplified expressions carefully, we can see that the right-hand side for both side, \"(!q | r)\", is the same. The left-hand side, however, differs slightly.\n\n- From (!p|q)>r, the equivalent form becomes !(!p|q) | r; using rule (6): !(p) & !(q) | r; and then rule (4): !p & (!q | r). This translates back to the form we have for the right side of the simplified p>(q>r).\n\nThus, under simplification according to the logic rules provided, the essence of both ((p>q)>r) and (p>(q>r)) comes down to an expression that can be represented as a part of the simplified form of the other. Therefore, under the simplification rules provided, we can consider them to be equivalent as they can simplify to forms that have equivalent expressions.\n\\[ \\therefore (p>q)>r = p>(q>r) \\]\n\nThe answer is: \\[[A]\\]"}

By applying the Basic Equivalences:\n\n- According to (7): A | (A & B) ::=:: A, we can see that p ::=:: (p & q) | (p & !q) is equal to p ::=:: p.\n\nSo, (1) is valid.\n\nFor (2), we have (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q)). By applying the Basic Equivalences:\n\n- By (7): A & (A | B) ::=:: A, we have (p | q) & (!(p | q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p | q).\n- Using (9): A & !A ::=:: 0, then (p | q) & !(p | q) equates to 0.\n\nNow, looking at the left side, (p & !q) | (!p & q) is not immediately recognizable as an equivalence to 0. To make it more obvious:\n\n- By distribution law (5): A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C), (!p & q) can be seen as !p & (p | q). Using the above, we then have (p & !q) | (!p & (p | q))\n\n- Now using distributivity, we can consider the separated clauses: We have (p & !q) | (!p & q) which simplifies to p | !q | !p | q. \n\n- By (7)'s reciprocal: A | (A & B) ::=:: A, we then have p | q | !q | !p.\n\n- !q and q cancel each other following (8) and (9) rules, simplifying the expression further: p | !p\n\n- Using (8) A | !A ::=:: 1, this simplifies to 1.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the equivalence simplifies to 1 while the right-hand side simplifies to 0.\n\nSo, (2) being (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q)) is not valid.\n\nThus, the answer is [[A];[B]]."}

No\n(1) (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r)\n(2) (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "For (1), we are given the expression (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r) and need to determine if it is valid based on the given equivalences. The NOR operation (⇓) is defined in (16) as A ⇓ B ::=:: !A & !B. To prove the equivalence, we need to expand the NOR operations and apply the equivalences to see if the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) are equal.\n\nLHS: (p⇓q)⇓r\n= (!p & !q)⇓r (Applying (16))\n= (!(!p & !q) & !r) (Applying (16))\n= (!(!p) | !(!q)) & !r (Applying (6))\n= (p | q) & !r (Applying (1) twice, equivalence of double negation)\n\nRHS: p⇓(q⇓r)\n= p⇓(!q & !r) (Applying (16))\n= !(p) & !(!q & !r) (Applying (16))\n= !p & (!(!q) | !(!r)) (Applying (6))\n= !p & (q | r) (Applying (1) twice, equivalence of double negation)\n\nSince LHS ≠ RHS, (1) is not valid.\n\nFor (2), the expression is (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r). The NAND operation (⇑) is defined in (15) as A ⇑ B ::=:: !A | !B. To prove the equivalence, we need to expand the NAND operations and apply the equivalences to see if the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) are equal.\n\nLHS: (p⇑q)⇑r\n= (!p | !q)⇑r (Applying (15))\n= !(!p | !q) | !r (Applying (15))\n= (!(!p) & !(!q)) | !r (Applying (6))\n= (p & q) | !r (Applying (1) twice, equivalence of double negation)\n\nRHS: p⇑(q⇑r)\n= p⇑(!q | !r) (Applying (15))\n= !(p) | !(!q | !r) (Applying (15))\n= !p | (!(!q) & !(!r)) (Applying (6))\n= !p | (q & r) (Applying (1) twice, equivalence of double negation)\n\nSince we get the same pattern for both sides involving the AND and OR operations, we can apply similar distributive and associative laws to verify the equivalence. The distributive law (5) allows us to distribute AND over OR or OR over AND. Given (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), we can see:\nLHS: (p & q) | !r\nApplying Distributive Law (5), we would have result that depend on {!p, !r}, {q, !r}, and {p, q}\nRHS: !p | (q & r)\nApplying Distributive Law (5), we would have result that depend on {!p, r}, {!p, q}, {q, r}\n\nDistributing the AND and OR, we can see that the logic pattern would match when we follow associative law (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C). Comparing the outcomes based on the patterns from both sides, we have {!p, !r}, {q, !r}, and {p, q} on the LHS and {!p, r}, {!p, q}, {q, r} on the RHS.\n\nConsidering the equivalence of these sets in the final logic expression, (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r) does involve matching OR and AND operations that are commutatively and associatively the same, but the vectors based on negation patterns reveal that the positions of \"r\" create a non-equivalent expression when distributive laws are individually applied, showing:\n\nLHS distribution result depends on: {!p, !r}, {q, !r}, and {p, q} while\nRHS distribution result depends on: {!p, r}, {!p, q}, and {q, r}\n\nThus, (2) is not valid.\n\nThe answer for the question is [[B];[B]]."}

The answer format should be:\n[[C1=...];[C2=...];[C3=...];[D1=...];[D2=...];[D3=...]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To define the logical expressions for each person based on their correctness, we apply the given rules and construe their statements in terms of the propositions p, q, and r. \n\nLet's define the logical expressions for each person:\n\n**Person B (B1, B2, B3):**\n\n- B1 (Person B's statements are entirely correct): p & !q (this is directly Person B's statement)\n- B2 (Person B's statements are partially correct): This should represent the case that one part of B's statement is true (either p or !q), but not both parts at the same time. According to the rules, a partially correct statement would be a conjunction where exactly one of the parts is true, so we will use the XOR operation (exclusive or). However, since XOR is not directly represented in the set of rules we have, we will instead express this by stating that one part is true and the other is false. The statement p for B means precisely p & !(!q), which simplifies to p alone because p & q is already false, and the statement !q being true in this case means which simplifies to !q but considering that p cannot be false if p is being considered true, this logical expression would be nonsensical because, in the given problem context, B's statements cannot be partially correct if we are working with the constraint that statements are either \"entirely correct\" or \"entirely incorrect\" based on the nature of conjunction and the problem's description. However, following the logical reasoning as per the question's intention, for B2, since assuming that a single proposition being true and the other false would have no logical ground in this context without considering conjunctions as fully \"true\" or \"false\", we consider this from the perspective of practical logic rather than idealized propositions. Hence, given the context of the problem, B2 is also an expression in line with simplified, idealized logical operations but becomes incompletely represented in the given problem without an explicit intersection with the truth of a single proposition where, due to the nature of conjunctions, B's statements entirety become the metric for accuracy rather than part to part accuracy due to the binary nature of \"true\" vs \"false\". So, in this context, we can conclude that B2 is unlikely to occur following the problem's constraints and intended logic rules given the partial correctness would not be a valid conclusion within the given problem parameters. Therefore, following the literal interpretation while keeping to the contextually derived rules where conjunctions entire entities cannot have partial truth without impacting the entirety of the conjunction itself due to a single proposition's truth or falsity essentially acting as the metric for the conjunction's status, B2 = (p&!(!q))|(!p&q) which simplifies to (p&q)|(!p&q) and can be further simplified given the rules for conjunction or by recognizing that regardless of p's status, the q variable's truth status cannot be absolutely true and false in parallel due to variable exclusivity, thus rendering the simplified form as logically implausible in the problem's context, we can rephrase the given question to mean (!p&q)|(p&!q) which is an interpretation of B2 assuming both parts of B's totally incorrect or correct statement are disjoint. This is because if Person B's 'whole' statement is correct, then both p and !q have to be true simultaneously, making a partially correct statement invalid in this context, hence the reformulation to adhere to intended logic within the problem.\n- B3 (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect): !p & q\n\n**Person C (C1, C2, C3):**\n \n- C1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct): !q & !r (this is directly Person C’s statement as provided)\n- C2 (Person C's statements are partially correct): We could use the XOR operation just like in B2's explanation, but given the nature of disjunctions between conjunctions, it can lead to C2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r) which basically means either the statement that \"not from Shanghai\" is true and \"not from Hangzhou\" is false (implying he is from Hangzhou), or the statement \"not from Hangzhou\" is true and \"not from Shanghai\" is false (implying he is from Shanghai). This makes sense logically, as in a partially correct scenario, the split must lead to an \"either or\" truth/falsity scenario. Note: This again, makes sense contextually only because we know, given the problem context of one proposition’s truth being the determinant for the conjunction's totality, the idea of partial correctness becomes less viable in a binary existence of truth/falsity indicating that C2 may logically become a form of instantiation that might not hold in the strict logical problem framework.\n- C3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect): q | r\n\nFinally, let's provide the logical expressions for Person C:\nD1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct): !q & !r\nD2 (Person C's statements are partially correct): As C2 defined above, we consider the alternative states where one part of D's statement is true, and the other part is false. Hence, D2 = q & !r | !q & r\nD3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect): q | r\n\nSo, the final answer with revised section for B2 (accounting initially for error under problem-specific interpretation that did not account for the given constraint): \n[[C1=!q & !r];[C2=(!q & r) | (q & !r)];[C3=q | r];[D1=!q & !r];[D2=(q & !r) | (!q & r)];[D3=q | r]]\n\nTaking into account the revision that questioned the consistency or validity of depicting \"partially correct\" propositions given the problem context with conjunctions acting as binary truth-state truths, we then revise the interpretation to reflect the most logical responses as per problem constraints.\n\n### Answer:\n[\n[C1=!q & !r];\n[C2=(q & !r) | (!q & r)];\n[C3=q | r];\n[D1=!q & !r];\n[D2=(q & !r) | (!q & r)];\n[D3=q | r]\n]"}

The truth value assignments are \\(p = \\text{False}, q = \\text{True}, r = \\text{False}\\).\n\n### Case 2:\n- p (p is True, Prof. Wang is from Suzhou)\n- !q (q is False, Prof. Wang isn’t from Shanghai)\n- r (r is True, Prof. Wang is from Hangzhou)\n\nThis case cannot satisfy the constraint that exactly one proposition is True since two propositions (p and r) would need to be True, which is not allowed.\n\nThis means only Case 1 can happen, implying:\n\n### Conclusion:\n- p is False (not Suzhou)\n- q is True (Shanghai)\n- r is False (not Hangzhou)\n\nGiven this, Prof. Wang is from SHANGHAI.\n\nNow, let's identify who got everything right, who got half right, and who got everything wrong.\n\n### Who got everything right?\nBased on the truth assignments:\n- B1=!p&q (A is entirely correct if p is False and q is True.)\n- C1=p&!q (B said p is True and q is False, which is False.)\n- D1=!q&!r (C said q is False and r is False, and that is True with q being True and r being False—false interpretation due to the meaning of \"neither from.\")\n\nAmong A, B, C, **C** fully accurately matched the situation described in Case 1. So, C got everything right.\n\n### Who got half right?\nB2=(p & q) | (!p & !q) does not apply as there is no half-right scenario possible under the conditions provided since exactly one proposition can be true.\n\nNevertheless, performing a finer inspection:\n- A's statement can be considered half-right since he correctly identifies that Prof. Wang is not from Suzhou (!p=True) but incorrectly specifies that Prof. Wang is from Shanghai (q=True, which is correct).\n- B's statement was entirely incorrect since Prof. Wang is from Shanghai and not Suzhou.\n- C's statement was initially considered \"correct\" under our interpretation of \"neither\" as &&, but in reasoning terms, this is more a categorical denial leading to misinterpretation within the scope of our logic (C did not accurately describe “neither”).\n\nSince the interpretations provided for 'half right' in the calculated expressions are not directly applicable, pragmatically, **A** could be considered as having gotten **half right**, given he correctly identified that Prof. Wang is **not** from Suzhou and incorrectly identified that Prof. Wang is from Shanghai, although q being True makes the latter part also correct.\n\n### Who got everything wrong?\n- B said Prof. Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai, directly in contradiction with the truth value, making **B** the one who got everything wrong.\n\nHence, the sequentially phased answer aligns with:\n[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: C]; [partially correct: A]; [entirely incorrect: B]]\n\nTherefore:\n```python\n[[options[1]],          # Shanghai\n [options[2]],          # C got everything right\n [options[0]],          # A got half right\n [options[1]]]          # B got everything wrong\n``` \n\nWhich, mapping back to our simplistically defined answer layout, is:\n```python\n# Live Python replacement for the final answer mapping\noptions = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"Suzhou\", \"Shanghai\", \"Hangzhou\"]\n[[options[4]],          # ['Shanghai']\n [options[2]],          # ['C']\n [options[0]],          # ['A']\n [options[1]]]          # ['B']\n``` \n\nThe recognized answer provided completes the logical analysis as guided by the rule specifications."}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired disjunctive terms:...];[denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we need to analyze the given expression (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) to find its paired disjunctive terms.\n\nThe given expression is a conjunction of two clauses:\n- (p∨¬q∨r)\n- (¬p∨¬q∨r)\n\nTo find the paired disjunctive terms, we have to first convert the given expression into its principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF). However, since the PCNF already consists of conjunctive clauses that might individually be simplified or paired, we can directly focus on identifying the situations that would make this expression false. This is because the expression is true when either of the conjunctive clauses is true, and such an instance can be represented by a disjunctive term.\n\nThe paired disjunctive term corresponds to the situation where both conjunctive clauses are false, given that we are dealing with a conjunction. This can only happen when:\n- Both p and ¬p are false, which is impossible in Boolean algebra.\n- For the first clause (p∨¬q∨r) to be false, it requires p = 0, ¬q = 0, and r = 0 (q = 1, r = 0).\n- For the second clause (¬p∨¬q∨r) to be false, it requires ¬p = 0 (p = 1), ¬q = 0 (q = 1), and r = 0.\n\nBut the only situation that results in the given expression being false is when q = 1 and r = 0, regardless of the value of p. Therefore, the conditions that make the expression false directly represent a single paired disjunctive term.\n\nFor p = 0, q = 1, r = 0, the binary false assignment is 010 → binary 2 → hexadecimal 2, so this is denoted in terms of our logic as M2.\n\nThus, the paired disjunctive terms of the given expression are represented by M2, since this is the only term that represents the false assignment for both disjuncts simultaneously.\n\nThe answer can be expressed as follows:\n[[paired disjunctive terms: M2];[denoted:M2]]"}

None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, identify the propositional variables and their arrangement in ¬p∧¬q∧¬r. The propositional variables are p, q, and r, and the formula is in a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once. The propositional variables or their negations are arranged in lexicographical order (¬p, ¬q, ¬r).\n\nNext, find the binary number that corresponds to the true assignment of this paired conjunctive term. The true assignment for ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is 000, because ¬p is true when p is false (0), ¬q is true when q is false (0), and ¬r is true when r is false (0). The binary number in this case is 000.\n\nThe binary number 000 corresponds to hexadecimal number 0. According to the rule, the paired conjunctive term is denoted as m0.\n\nSince m0 is included in the formula, it suggests that the formula is a basic formula according to the given rule. However, we should also check if this is a tautology, contradiction, all-even, or all-odd formula.\n\nFor a tautology, all 2^n paired conjunctive terms should be included in the principal disjunctive normal form, which is not the case for ¬p∧¬q∧¬r (only m0 is included).\n\nFor a contradiction, there should be no paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, which is also false since m0 is true for this formula.\n\nAn all-even or all-odd formula requires that all indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form are either all even or all odd. Since only m0 is included and 0 is even, this could suggest an all-even formula. However, the rule specifically states \"all\" even, implying more than one. Since there's only one term, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r cannot be strictly classified as \"all-even\" unless the term \"all\" inherently allows for singularity in this context, which is a matter of interpretation.

If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given formula conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) or principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), we first need to analyze the formula given in the question: (¬p∧¬q∧¬r)V(¬p∧¬q∧r)V(¬p∧q∧r)V(p∧¬q∧r)V(p∧q∧r).\n\n1. Identify the propositional variables: p, q, r.\n\n2. Determine if the formula is in the correct form for PDNF or PCNF. The given formula is in the form of a disjunction of conjunctive terms.\n\n3. Verify that each conjunctive term is a paired conjunctive term according to the logic rule. A paired conjunctive term has each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once. Since there are n=3 variables, we expect 2^n = 8 different paired conjunctive terms.\n\n4. Check if the formula consists of all paired conjunctive terms that satisfy the properties outlined:\n   - (¬p∧¬q∧¬r) corresponds to m7 (111 in binary, which is 7 in hexadecimal).\n   - (¬p∧¬q∧r) corresponds to m6 (110 in binary, which is 6 in hexadecimal).\n   - (¬p∧q∧r) corresponds to m5 (101 in binary, which is 5 in hexadecimal).\n   - (p∧¬q∧r) corresponds to m3 (011 in binary, which is 3 in hexadecimal).\n   - (p∧q∧r) corresponds to m7 (001 in binary, but actually, this term corresponds to m1 not m7, the binary string correctly indicates m1 (001 -> 1 in hexadecimal)). There seems to be a misinterpretation in the description, but following the logic provided:\n   \n   The remaining paired conjunctive terms not included in the formula are:\n   - (p∧q∧¬r) – m6 (010 in binary).\n   - (¬p∧q∧¬r) – m5 (100 in binary).\n   - (p∧¬q∧¬r) – m3 (011 in binary) is partially overlapping.\n   - (¬p∧¬q∧r) – m6 (110 in binary) is partially overlapping.\n   \nSince there are repeated indices (m3 and m6 are both mentioned for different conjunctive terms), it denotes that there are terms not included explicitly but are subsumed. The actual number mentioned for the cases should be: m1, m3, m5.\n\nThe given formula does not include all 8 paired conjunctive terms. However, it is indeed in the form of PDNF, being a disjunction of conjunctive terms that are paired. It does not conform to the PCNF, which would be a conjunction of disjunctive terms.\n\nGiven that it includes some but not all paired conjunctive terms and all the included terms have odd indices, the formula is an all-odd formula but not a complete PDNF consisting of all paired conjunctive terms.\n\nHence, the answer is:\n[[A]; [M1∨M3∨M5]] where 'A' indicates this is a PDNF, and the denoted expression shows the odd indices M1, M3, M5 that represent the false assignments of the conjunctive terms representing the formula.\nBut considering that M represents the false assignment and the problem statement changes conventions with lowercase and uppercase terms momentarily, we must correct the single notation thus: [[A]; [m1 v m3 v m5]] to show the correct true assignment indices for a PDNF (maintaining the misapplied human logic, yet correcting the v and ∧ relation based on the explanations).\nTo adhere to the strictest interpretation of the instructions for clarity, [[A]; [m1 v m3 v m5]] is the correct.\n\nIn such a format where odd indices of the paired conjunctive terms are involved, it indicates that the formula can be considered for a PDNF but not a comprehensive formula or tautology."}

The paired conjunctive terms that make up the principal DNF will be all possible combinations of the propositional variables and their negations, each arranged to satisfy the given rules.\n\nTo be a basic form, a formula must include m0 in its principal DNF, meaning that there has to be at least one conjunctive term where all propositional variables are negated (which corresponds to the binary 0000, hexadecimal 0).\n\nTo be an all-even form, all the conjunctive terms in the principal DNF of the formula must have indices that are even, corresponding to hexadecimal values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, and E.\n\nIn a formula with 4 variables, it is not possible to be an all-even form while also including m0, which corresponds to the binary 0000 and hexadecimal 0. The reason is that all-even forms require every term's binary representation to have an even count of 1s (an even 'weight'), but the binary number 0000 has a weight of 0, which is not considered even when judging the terms' binary format (it's considered a special case due to being the lowest possible value).\n\nHowever, given the original definition, if a formula A for 4 propositional variables must be both a basic form (includes m0) and an all-even form (all conjunctive terms in DNF have even indices), no such formula satisfies these conditions simultaneously because m0 is an all-zero binary term and itself does not count as an 'even-weighted' binary term following the logic rule's conditions for an all-even form.\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas with 4 propositional variables that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form AND an all-even form is [0]."}

None of the Above\n\nAnswer format: [[denoted expression];[options]]\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we need to convert the conjunctions and disjunctions in the formula \\((¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)\\) into a form that follows the rule for paired disjunctive terms. Specifically, we need to ensure that the terms are in a format where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and they are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order of the variables. However, since we are dealing with just three variables and their distinct assignments are already in a format following the rule for paired terms, we will not need to rearrange the terms.\n\nThe disjunctive term \\((¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)\\) corresponds to the binary assignment where \\(\\neg p\\), \\(\\neg q\\), and \\(r\\) are true. This corresponds to the binary number \"100\", which is the hexadecimal number 4. Therefore, this paired disjunctive term can be denoted as \\(M4\\).\n\nThe disjunctive term \\((¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r)\\) corresponds to the binary assignment where \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(\\neg r\\) are true, while \\(q\\) is true. This corresponds to the binary number \"010\", which is the hexadecimal number 2. Therefore, this paired disjunctive term can be denoted as \\(M2\\).\n\nThe disjunctive term \\((p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)\\) corresponds to the binary assignment where \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg q\\) are true, while \\(r\\) is true. This corresponds to the binary number \"101\", which is the hexadecimal number 5.

That is not the case here because we do have some paired disjunctive terms.\n\nC. Basic Formula: This would mean it includes \\(m0\\). Since \\(m0\\) in our notation would correspond to a condition where all propositional variables are false, which is not one of the terms we identified, this is also not the case.\n\nD. All-Even Form: This would mean all indices in the paired terms are even. Here we have \\(M2\\), \\(M4\\), but \\(M5\\) has an odd index, so this is not the case.\n\nE. All-Odd Form: This would mean all indices in the paired terms are odd. Only \\(M5\\) has an odd index, so this is not the case for all terms.\n\nF.

In this case, C1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r and C2 = ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t. The common literal that could potentially be resolved is ¬q, where L = q and L’ = ¬q.\n\nApplying complement and resolution according to the given logic rule:\nC1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r\nC2 = ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t\n\nWhen resolving C1 and C2 with respect to L’ = ¬q and L = q, the compound literal ¬q disappears in the resolution since it is found in both C1 and C2, but in different clauses. Thus, we have:\n\ndispel(C1, C2) = r ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t ∨ ¬p, if we blindly follow the \"resolve all\" procedure.\n\nHowever, noticing r and ¬r both appear and form a contradiction pair, resolution can directly result in their mutual elimination instead of retaining them.\n\nTherefore, after eliminating r ∨ ¬r, we are left with:\n\ndispel(C1, C2) = s ∨ ¬t ∨ ¬p.\n\nThus, the answer to what is dispel(C1, C2) is [s, ¬t, ¬p]."}

Here, C1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬s and C2 = s. The literal in C1 that is complemented in C2 is ¬s, with s being its complement.\n\nTherefore, we can resolve C1 and C2 using the resolution rule, where C1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬s and C2 = s acts as L'. The literal ¬s in C1 corresponds to s in C2.\n\nSo, dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4 where C3 and C4 are the clauses in C1 and C2 without the complementary literals. Here, C3 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r and C4 is empty since C2 = s and there is no clause in C2 beside the literal s to be resolved.\n\nHence, dispel(C1, C2) = [p ∨ ¬q ∨ r].\nIn the specified format, this is [[]][p ∨ ¬q ∨ r]. \n\nHowever, since the presence or absence of an empty clause doesn't alter the obtained result, a more appropriate answer format here would be just the non-empty clause, which is simplified to [p ∨ ¬q ∨ r] in the given format. \n\nSo the answer is [p ∨ ¬q ∨ r]."}

Since S0 is empty at this point, no resolution can occur between S0 and S1. The algorithm then goes on to resolve between the clauses in S1.\n\nThe resolution process:\n- Resolving '¬p ∨ q' and 'p ∨ q' results in 'q', but since 'q' is already in S1, it is not added to S2.\n- Resolving '¬p ∨ q' and 'q' doesn't yield a new clause as the resolving literal 'q' and '¬q' are not present in the clauses.\n- Resolving 'p ∨ q' and 'q' also doesn't yield a new clause for the same reason as above.\n\nTherefore, after the first loop iteration, S2 does not contain any new elements since no new clauses were derived from the resolution process that are not already present in S1.\n\nThe answer before the first iteration and after the first iteration will be:\nBefore:\n[S0: ∅; S1: {¬p ∨ q, p ∨ q, q}; S2: ∅;]\nAfter:\n[S0: ∅; S1: {¬p ∨ q, p ∨ q, q}; S2: ∅;]\n\nNow, when we proceed to the second iteration, S0 will include S1, and S1 will be set to S2 (which is empty in this case).\n\nAfter the first iteration, since no clauses were added to S2, no updating of S2 happened, thus:\n[S0: ∅; S1: {¬p ∨ q, p ∨ q, q}; S2: ∅;]"}

First, we identify the conjunctive normal form (CNF) clauses given:\n\n1. \\(p ∨ q\\)\n2. \\(p ∨ ¬q\\)\n3. \\(¬p ∨ r\\)\n\nLet's define these as our initial \\(S_1\\):\n\n- \\(S_1\\) = {\\{p, q\\}, \\{p, ¬q\\}, \\{¬p, r\\}}\n- \\(S_0 = S_2 = ∅\\)\n\nWe will now proceed to resolve clauses according to the algorithm:\n\n### Resolution between \\(S_0\\) and \\(S_1\\)\n\nSince \\(S_0\\) is initially an empty set, we do not have any clauses in \\(S_0\\) to resolve with \\(S_1\\) at this point, so we move on to the next step.\n\n### Resolution between pairs in \\(S_1\\)\n\n1. Resolving \\(\\{p, q\\}\\) and \\(\\{p, ¬q\\}\\):\n\n   - L in \\(\\{p, q\\}\\) is \\(q\\), so L' in \\(\\{p, ¬q\\}\\) is \\(¬q,\\) corresponding;\n   - dispel(\\(\\{p, q\\}\\), \\(\\{p, ¬q\\}\\)) is \\(\\{p\\}\\).\n\n2.

Apply the given logical operations:\n   - The conjunction operation (p ∧ q) means that both p and q must be true (powered, \"+\") for the operation to result in true (powered, \"+\").\n   - The negation operation (¬) inverts the truth value of the expression it is applied to.

We then determine the output based on the logical expression:\n   - When p and q are both powered (p = \"+\", q = \"+\"), the conjunction (p ∧ q) is true (powered, \"+\"). Applying the negation (¬) will make the output not powered (\"-\").\n   - When either p or q or both are not powered (p = \"-\", q = \"+\"; p = \"+\", q = \"-\"; p = \"-\", q = \"-\"), the conjunction (p ∧ q) is not true (not powered, \"-\").

We are dealing with the logical expression (p∧q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧q)∨(p∨r) and need to find cases where this expression evaluates to false.\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n1. (p∧q∧¬r) - This sub-expression evaluates to true when p, q are true and r is false.\n2. (¬p∧q) - This sub-expression evaluates to true when p is false and q is true.\n3. (p∨r) - This sub-expression evaluates to true when either p or r is true.\n\nThe output O will be \"-\" (false) when all three sub-expressions are false. Let's determine the conditions under which this occurs:\n\n- (p∧q∧¬r) is false: This is true when any of p, q is false, or r is true.\n- (¬p∧q) is false: This is true when p is true or q is false.\n- (p∨r) is false: This is only true when both p and r are false.\n\nNow, combining these conditions, we find the scenarios where all three sub-expressions are false, meaning the overall expression is false, and the output O is \"-\".\n\nAnalyzing conditions, we find the following:\n- For (p∨r) to be false, both p and r must be false.\n- Since (¬p∧q) requires p to be true for it to be false (given q can be either true or false), we cannot have p as true because this conflicts with the condition for (p∨r).\n- Therefore, p must be false and r can be either false (to fulfill the condition for (p∨r)) or true (to fulfill the condition for (p∧q∧¬r) part of becoming false).\n\nGiven that p is false, (¬p∧q) is automatically false for any value of q. This implies q is irrelevant for this case. Therefore, q can be either true or false.\n\nThus, for the output O to be \"-\", valid combinations for (p, q, r) are:\n- [False, True, False]\n- [False, False, True]\n- [False, True, True]\n\nIn the requested format, the answer would be encoded as:\n[[False, True, False]; [False, False, True]; [False, True, True]]\nConverting to notation, we get:\n[[-, +, -]; [-, -, +]; [-, +, +]]"}

However, if you meant the logic to be translated into a formal logic notation, it would look like:\n- Formula (1): [∀x∀y(∃z(x + y = z))]\n- Formula (2): [∃x(∃z(x + y = x * z))]\n\nNote: The square brackets represent the full logic formulas, and the semi-colon separates different formulas when written in a single line. This is an interpretation of how you might want the answer formatted given the unique request for \"[];[]\"."}

To infer a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, we need to convert the position of the subject and predicate.\n\nSince the proposition is of type A, we can use Method C, which first performs obversion and then conversion. However, for the given proposition, we only need the conversion part (Method B) to get \"All formally correct reasoning is correct reasoning\", but to directly get a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject using the defined methods, Method C is the appropriate choice since it encompasses both obversion and conversion.\n\nAfter obversion, the proposition becomes \"All correct reasoning is not non-formally correct reasoning\". Since the goal is to infer with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, performing conversion on this obverted form will give us \"All non-formally correct reasoning is not correct reasoning\". However, to achieve a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, we need to apply conversion directly to the original proposition using Method B, which yields \"All formally correct reasoning is correct reasoning\", or if considering the full process as stated for Method C, \"All non-formally correct reasoning is not correct reasoning\" is obtained by Method C after obversion and conversion steps.\n\nGiven the instructions to use \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject directly, Method B is the simpler, direct route.\n\nHowever, as per the instruction to answer in the format of [[A/B/C]], and considering that Method C involves the extra step of obversion which is not necessary in the given scenario, but wanting to adhere strictly to the instructions without extraneous steps, the answer should be considered in direct relation to what effectively yields the output proposition as required:\n\nAnswer: [[B]]"}

The statements given are:\n- ∀P⇒M (Premise 1)\n- ∀M⇒¬S (Premise 2)\n- The conclusion we are deducing is ∀S⇒¬P.\n\nTo fit this argument into one of the defined syllogism forms, we need to figure out which figure and mood describes it most accurately. We see that the middle term, M, appears as the predicate in the first premise and as the subject in the second premise. This arrangement of the middle term indicates that we are dealing with Figure IV. In syllogisms, the first premise involves the major term (P) with the middle term (M), the second premise involves the middle term (M) with the minor term (S), and the conclusion links the major term (P) with the minor term (S).\n\nLooking at the given conclusion '∀S⇒¬P', for it to be a valid conclusion in Figure IV, the premises need to be structured in a way that one can derive a specific valid mood. The premises and conclusion can be aligned as follows in the syllogism form specific to Figure IV:\n1) P()M (premise 1: ∀P⇒M)\n2) M()S (premise 2: ∀M⇒¬S)\n3) Therefore S()P (conclusion: ∀S⇒¬P)\n\nNow, let's see which valid mood it corresponds to:\n\n- The first premise is ∀P⇒M, which is represented by an A proposition.\n- The second premise is ∀M⇒¬S, which is represented by an E proposition.\n- The conclusion is ∀S⇒¬P, which is represented by an E proposition.\n\nThis creates an AEE mood. Looking at the valid moods for Figure IV, we do have AEE listed.\n\nSo, the argument corresponds to [[IV];[AEE]] in the context of syllogism figures and moods."}

The syllogism presented is of the form:\n\\[ P()M \\]\n\\[ SEM \\]\n\\[ \\therefore S()P \\]\n\nHere, 'SEM' is in the form where the S term is linked to the M term with an 'O' type proposition (i.e., ∃S⇒¬M), and 'P()M' and 'S()P' are to be determined based on the valid figures and moods as per the given logic rule.\n\nLooking at the forms of the four figures of the syllogism, we can identify that the given syllogism matches the second pattern (Figure II); thus, we are dealing with:\n\\[ P()M \\]\n\\[ S()M \\]\n\\[ \\therefore S()P \\]\n\nGiven that 'SEM' is valid, we can see that it corresponds to the 'O' operation.

The conclusion \"SOP\" indicates that the resulting proposition is an \"O\" type, which corresponds to \"∃p1⇒¬p2\".\n\nFirst, let's identify the figure that can have an \"O\" type conclusion:\n- In Figure I, a valid mood for an \"O\" type proposition is not present.\n- In Figure II, a valid mood for an \"O\" type proposition is \"EIO\".\n- In Figure III, a valid mood for an \"O\" type proposition is \"EIO\".\n- In Figure IV, a valid mood for an \"O\" type proposition is also \"EIO\".\n\nSince we need to find a fit for the premises and the conclusion, we look for a figure that can fill the given premises as \"()O()\" and \"()A()\" and have the conclusion \"SOP\". \"EIO\" in Figure II or III could work, as \"O\" can fit as the second proposition in the mood.\n\nIf we use Figure II (P()M, S()M ∴S()P) with mood \"EIO\":\n- The first premise would be \"P()M\", which could match \"PO()\", but we need \"O()\" to fit our given premises, making Figure II an unlikely candidate in this case as we would need \"MOM\" as a premise to have \"O\" as the predicate.\n- Similarly, for Figure III (M()P, M()S ∴S()P) with mood \"EIO\":\n    - The first premise is \"M()P\" which could match, allowing the \"O\" type to come from the first proposition \"MOM\".\n    - The second premise is \"M()S,\" which could match \"MAS\", allowing it to fit with the \"A\" type proposition \"MA()\".\n    - This arrangement aligns with \"MOM, MAS\" producing the correct conclusion \"SOP\" under the \"EIO\" mood.\n\nThus, the appropriate configuration is in Figure III, with the premises \"MOM, MAS\" following the \"EIO\" mood.\n\n[[\"E\"; \"M\"; \"O\"; \"M\"];[\"A\"; \"M\"; \"A\"; \"S\"];[\"S\"; \"O\"; \"P\"]]."}

This rules out AEE, EAE, and AOO from Figures I, II, and IV.\n\nLooking at the valid moods for Figure III, both IAI and IIO could potentially fit, but IAI starts with an I-form which matches the first premise MIP.\n\nThus, the valid mood to fill in the parentheses is IAI, where:\n- The second premise will be MII (Existential: \"Some M are S\")\n- The conclusion will be AIS (Existential: \"Some S are P\")\n\nTherefore, the completed syllogism in valid mood IAI (from Figure III) is:\n- MIP (Existential: \"Some M are P\")\n- MII (Existential: \"Some M are S\")\n- ∴SIP (Existential: \"Some S are P\")\n\nIn the specified format:\n\n[[\"MIP\"], [\"MII\"], [\"SIP\"]]\n\nHowever, the instruction asks for the answer in the format of [[];[]].

In modal terms, this translates to the negation of the possibility that science is the work of one man. However, since p only addresses whether science is a human endeavour, and not the number of people involved, we need a new proposition to define this aspect.\n\nLet's define q: \"Science is the work of one man.\"\n\nThe statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" translates to the proposition that it is necessarily not the case that q is true. Symbolically, this can be represented as:\n\\[#\\neg q\\]\n\nSince we don't have a direct relationship between p and q, we'll only translate q into modal logic notation. We are not asked to translate \"Science is a human endeavour,\" as \"one-man endeavour\" is a separate proposition from p.\n\nThus, referring to the specific instruction in the question, the answer is:\n\\[[\\!# \\neg q]\\]"}

Since we are focusing on the relationships defined in the instruction, and the second sentence does not fit into any of these (it is not about the past or future of Aunt Wang's awards), we cannot define a specific relationship following the given rules between \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and an unrelated future action such as \"Allow the execution of contracts.\"\n\nHowever, for the purpose of answering based on the given options and applying the logic rule, we must interpret the second sentence as best we can. If we attempt to relate it loosely to the logic rule for the sake of answering the question in the given framework, and if we interpret \"Allow the execution of contracts\" as a statement about the future, we might represent it as something relating to the future, such as Fq or Gq, where q represents \"allowing contract executions\". As the two sentences are about totally separate matters, neither the truth nor the falsity of \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" can directly influence the truth or falsity of \"Allow the execution of contracts\" under the scope of the given logical rules and symbols. \n\nTherefore, for a forced interpretation based on the options given, we might consider the relationship X (Non-applicable based on specified relationships because no relationship in the provided structure connects statements about past events to unrelated future actions).\n\nFor the sake of the question format:\nThe non-applicable option does not match any option (A-D). However, we shall select the closest one as a placeholder for this approach.\n\nThus, the relationship between these two sentences in an attempted application to existing rules would be – (this is not an ideal answer under the given framework due to the nature of the sentences provided, but a placeholder as required by the format of the question)\n\nD (幾個 Relationship), assuming that unrelated statements can be represented as both true or both false in a very abstract sense, as within the logical framework provided, D is the closest placeholder for an abstract relationship without direct bearing on the truth-values of the propositions in question.\n\n### Complete Answer:\n[[A];[D]]"}

However, we have ¬Ap, which corresponds to the negation of A¬p. To use the inference formulas, we need to look for a formula that involves ¬Ap. Formula (10) gives us the direct implication, but we can use its contrapositive, which is given by formula (12) ¬H¬p → ¬A¬p. Taking the contrapositive of ¬H¬p we get H¬p, which is the statement we're looking to infer.\n\nThe reasoning that allows us to infer ¬Ap from H¬p is given by formula (9) Ap → Hp.

According to the Concurrent Rule:\n\n\\[⟨ c_1 || c_2 ⟩φ \\text{ is equivalent to } ⟨ c_1 ⟩⟨ c_2 ⟩φ ∨ ⟨ c_2 ⟩⟨ c_1 ⟩φ\\]\n\nSince neither \\(c_1\\) nor \\(c_2\\) affects the truth value of \\(\\varphi\\), executing either command first should not change whether \\(\\varphi\\) holds. Therefore, the simplified expression, keeping the rule's requirement in mind, would be:\n\n\\[⟨ c_1 ⟩⟨ c_2 ⟩φ\\]\n\nHowever, for the expression to be in the simplest form with the fewest occurrences of [] and <>, and considering the given conditions that executing either command doesn't affect \\(\\varphi\\), we can also see this expression as:\n\n\\[\\varphi\\]\n\nThis is because executing \\(c_1\\) or \\(c_2\\) doesn’t change the state of the system in such a way that affects the truth value of \\(\\varphi\\). So, the final and simplest form is \\(\\varphi\\) itself, indicating that the proposition holds regardless of the execution of \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\).\n\nTherefore, the most concise answer, adhering to the rule's requirement, is:\n\n\\(\\varphi\\)\n\nHowever, if we must keep to the specified formatting using [[]] for clarity and strict adherence to the rule application:\n\n\\[[\\;]\\varphi\\]\n\nis the technically accurate representation under this strict format."}

Method ⵣ:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5.

From this, it can be inferred that the movement of objects can generate heat.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\nA.⸮ method   B.؆ method   C.ꙮ method    D.ⵣ method   E.⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given scenarios involve multiple instances where movement (S) and heat generation (P) occur together under different conditions (rubbing hands, striking stones, hammering iron). Since the scenarios illustrate that heat generation follows movement in various contexts with varying other conditions, this matches the pattern of Method ⸮, which involves the co-occurrence of S and P in multiple cases while other conditions differ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [C]. However, there seems to be a mislabeling in the options given; the correct answer based on the provided logic rule would actually point to Method ⸮, which is not listed in the options A through E. Since we must choose from the given options, the closest match in method description is Method ꙮ, which also looks at positive and negative groups to infer causality but involves an explicit comparison with absence. Method ⸮, as shown, does not require a negative group for its inference.\n\nGiven the options provided, selecting [C] (Method ꙮ) would incorrectly imply a necessary comparison to a negative group which is not shown in the question. Yet, sticking to the provided instructions, the choice closest to the observed logic is [C].\n\nThus, the logical answer given the options and question presented would be [[C]]. However, if additional accuracy were possible by adjusting the answer to fit the rule demonstrated, the choice for Method ⸮ would be appropriate, but since it is not an available option, we default to the most similar logic pattern provided, which is Method ꙮ."}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "D\n\nThe passage describes a scenario where changes in the number of deep wells (S) correspond to changes in the amount of underground water used and the rate of ground subsidence (P).

BC Paradox: This deals with confirmation bias and the equivalence of a universal hypothesis to its contrapositive, neither of which are directly represented within the expression given.\n\nC. LS Paradox: This is about the situation where multiple hypotheses lead to a contradiction when those hypotheses are joined. The expression provided does not present with multiple hypotheses leading to a contradiction upon conjunction like in the LS paradox.\n\nThe given logical expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) essentially states that hypothesis q is true whether p is true or not (i.e., q is true regardless of p's truth value).

C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given statement does not directly invoke any of the specific mechanisms described under the Custom Cooperation Principles of C*, C%, or C!. However, we may analyze and reason as follows:\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n- **C* Principle** is about information strength and the speaker's knowledge to provide information. Xiao Ma opening the food box and observing the temperature of the beer does not directly involve information strength unless it implies something more that is not stated, such as Xiao Ma's expected knowledge about what should or should not be in the food box. This situation does not provide enough information to make such implications, so the C* Principle does not apply.\n\n- **C% Principle** deals with minimalization of information where the speaker only provides information necessary for the purpose of communication. Xiao Ma's observation might be considered the minimum necessary to convey the condition of the beer, but this principle doesn't confirm the relationship between beer and the food as proposed in the statement.\n\n- **C! Principle** explains that speakers should avoid using obscure or marked expressions without reason. The description about the beer being part of the food box is not particularly marked or obscure, so this principle does not apply.\n\nHowever, in the context of describing the C% Principle, the sentence provided seems to adhere to the Minimization Criterion, as it gives only the essential details pertinent to the description of Xiao Ma opening the food box and discovering the temperature of the beer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it is clear that: **B. C% Principle** is the closest principle applicable to the statement since it tells us Xiao Ma provided the least amount of information necessary to describe the scenario. Therefore, this situation may lean towards the C% Principle, although the principles are explained in terms of the speaker's and hearer's actions within the communication, and the statement provided does not capture a full interactive dialogue.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[B]]"}

Employee A's misunderstanding can be represented as: \"∀x (Bx → Px)\", thinking that if an employee receives a bonus, they have completed a project. This is a case of erroneously believing that if Q then P, given the original statement If P then Q. According to the custom formal fallacy naming rules, this is the CondSwap Method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[C]]."}
