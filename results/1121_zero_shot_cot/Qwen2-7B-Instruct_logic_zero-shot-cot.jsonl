This is because we are negating the conjunction of these propositions. For this formula to be true, either at least one of these propositions needs to be false, or p1, p2 are both false and ~p3 is true. We'll map out all combinations of truth and falsity of p1, p2, and ~p3 to identify truth and falsity assignments of the given formula.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze (2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nThis formula represents a conditional where if the conjunction of ~p1 and p2 is true, then p1 being equal to p3 must also be true. Let's assign truth and falsity to p1, p2, and p3 to unpack the conditions under which this conditional is either true or false.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Truth and Falsity Values\n\nFor each formula, we'll systematically assign truth (✓) and falsity (x) to p1, p2, and p3, test whether the formula meets the criteria for truth or falsity, then summarize the results in a standardized form (T:...;F:...) similar to the expected output format.\n\n### Steps to Calculate:\na. Obtain all possible combinations of truth (✓) and falsity (x) for inputs p1, p2, p3.\nb. Substitute these values into formulas (1) and (2) to check if they satisfy true or false conditions.\nc. Collect T (True) and F (False) values for both formulas separately.\nd. Format the outcome as described.\n\n### Calculated Truth and Falsity Values:\n- For (1) ~(p1&p2&~p3): All combinations that ensure at least one among p1, p2, or ~p3 is assigning a falsity (x) result in a true value for the formula. Remaining combinations result in falsity.\n- For (2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3): Conditioned on the truth or falsity of p1, p2, and p3, examining whether satisfying the premise ~p1 & p2 implies that p1 = p3.\n\nLet’s arrange the step-by-step outcomes:\n\n1.

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Formula (1) ~(~p1&p2)||~p3\n\n1. Given: \\(~(~p1 \\& p2) || ~p3\\)\n2. The highest priority logical connective is \\(\\&\\), so we analyze \\((~p1 & p2)\\) first, simplifying inside out due to the negation outside.\n3. \\((~p1 & p2)\\) can be either true (✓) or false (x), depending on \\(p1\\) and \\(p2\\).\n4. \\(~(~p1 & p2)\\) flips the truth value of \\((~p1 & p2)\\), meaning true becomes false, and false becomes true.\n5. \\((~p1 & p2)\\) OR \\(\\sim p3\\) is a disjunction, meaning if any part is true, the whole formula is true, regardless of the other part.\n6. Since \\(~p3\\) at the end can also be either true or false, depending on \\(p3\\), we can determine that this formula can have either false (x) or true (✓) under some assignments.\n\n### Formula (2) (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\n1. Given: \\((~p2 || p3) & (p1=::>p2)\\)\n2. We have two parts: \\((~p2 || p3)\\) and \\((p1=::>p2)\\). Let's look at each part separately.\n3. \\((~p2 || p3)\\) can be analyzed without assignment values; it's reducible to a simpler formula but requires dependency on \\(p2\\) and \\(p3\\) for a full truth value assignment.\n4. The implication \\(p1=::>p2\\) is false only if \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false, making this part sensitive to \\(p1\\) and \\(p2\\).\n5. The conjunction (&) requires both parts to be true for the whole formula to be true.\n6. Without specific values, we can determine that under certain assignments, the formula can be false (x), particularly if \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false.\n\n### Formula (3) (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\n1. Given: \\((p1=::>p2) & (~(p1 \\& p3) || p1)\\)\n2. This formula contains both implication and disjunction. We analyze each side separately.\n3. \\((p1=::>p2)\\) can easily be false under certain assignments (e.g., when \\(p1\\) is true and \\(p2\\) is false).\n4. The disjunction \\((~(p1 & p3) || p1)\\) can be analyze similarly to the previous step. The presence of \\(p1\\) ensures that it can be true under some assignments, but specifically disproved when \\(p1\\) and \\(p3\\) are both true.\n5. Given the conjunction (&) structure, both parts must be true for the whole formula to be true.\n6. With specific attention to \\(p1\\), \\(p2\\), and \\(p3\\), the formula can be analyzed to determine under which assignments it will be true or false; however, with the given structure and lack of specific assignments, we can mainly conclude that if any part that can potentially be false does, the formula as a whole can be false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n### Answer:\n[[F:x|x|x];[F:x,✓|x|x];[F:x|x|x,✓|✓|x]]"}

We know p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula, and ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula.\n\n(1) For the first formula (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2), we have two parts with different truth values based on our known formulas. The first part, p1=::>(p1||p2), is a Truth Formula by definition. The second part, ~(p1=::>p2)&p2, is a Falsehood Formula by definition. \n\nA conjunction (in this case, represented by \"&\") combines two propositions. If one proposition is a Truth Formula, it does not guarantee that the entire conjunction becomes a Truth Formula, as the truth value of the second part being a Falsehood Formula makes the overall truth of the conjunction false. Therefore, this formula is classified as a Falsehood Formula because the conjunction of a Truth Formula and a Falsehood Formula under any assignment is False.\n\n(2) For the second formula (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2), we are dealing with a disjunction (represented by \"||\"). The first part, p1=::>(p1||p2), is a Truth Formula. The second part, ~(p1=::>p2)&p2, is a Falsehood Formula.\n\nA disjunction combines two propositions, and at least one of the propositions needs to be True for the overall formula to be True. Since the first part is a Truth Formula, the entire disjunction is True, regardless of the Falsehood Formula in the second part.

Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are equivalent, we'll use the logical equivalence definitions. \n\n### Step 1: Proposition Symbolization\n1. (p>q)>r = (!p | q) > r\n2. p>(q>r) = p > (!q | r)\n\n### Step 2: Translate using the Implication Equivalence\nRecall:\n- A > B = !A | B\n\nApplying this:\n1. (!p | q) > r = !( !p | q) | r\n2. p > (!q | r) = !p | (!q | r)\n\n### Step 3: Apply De Morgan's Law and Other Rules\n1. !( !p | q) | r = p & !q | r\n2. !p | (!q | r) remains as is\n\n### Step 4: Simplify and Compare Expressions\nBoth expressions after applying implications and simplifying using De Morgan's Law result in:\nA. p & !q | r\n\nIt seems a minor discrepancy might lie in the simplification stage. Indeed, \"p & !q | r\" closely resembles \"(!p | q) > r\" which outputs \"r\" as a final value when no further implication applies. This can be regarded as equivalent upon final evaluation.\n\nHowever, compare again with the goal of discerning equivalence is crucial:\n\nThe implication (!p | q) > r converts to the disjunction p & !q | r.\n\nContrast with the original comparison format investigating:\n- p>(q>r) = !p | (!q | r)\n\nUpon re-examination:\n\n(1) (p>q)>r writes to (!p | q) > r, translating directly to (!(!p | q) | r) = p & !q | r – this outcome expresses a simplified implication relationship compared to the original formulation for equivalencing.\n\n(2) p>(q>r) reaffirms p directly without decomposing negated scenarios. This leaves similarity in structure as the initial point for equivalencing yet does not quash the essence that both don't precisely follow the same path in equivalent translation to their implied outcomes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMatching the proven equivalencies (unnecessarily looking into the common misunderstanding of the translation directly following the equivalence steps), both expressions :\n- (p>q)>r simplifies to p&!q|r\n- p>(q>r) simplifies to the similar structure but stands apart in its basis and implication therefore:\nA. Yes** with a nuanced caution** for an overall equivalence without indubitable identical structure following simplified rulesets directly through equivalence assumptions directly post-step transitions, emphasizing the importance of a formal proof over simplification methods guided directly by translation rules alone, aiming especially for clarity. Thus, advantageous insight draws to emphasize confirmation over error following assumptions from the original query's framing, potentially leveraging nuances in logical equivalencing and implication transformations directly under their stated rules. \n\nHence, the approach leads to nuanced understanding, correcting for potential gaps in interpreting the direct implications per equivalencies post-step simplification under the constraints set initially without an absolute mirroring of structures without acknowledgment of their transformation nuances. \n\n**Corrective Note: Inference should directly confirm truth values under their operations formally assessed without relying on assumptions post-translational simplification directly guided by stated equivalences. This shadow of confusion draws attention to formally confirm the truth of derived logical expressions comparing initially compared equivalencies directly under their final required formulation rules.\n\n### Answer:\nThus, upon formal assessment, correcting to yield the most accurate inference without equivocation:\n\n[[B]] B. No\n\nThe addressed logic demonstrates that the two expressions does not formally match in equivalent form simplified under their operations directly guided by their stated rulesets; hence, delineating with nuanced insight the correction towards confirmation as required without immediate assumption, revealing appropriately the distinction between their expressions given their transformation nuances. \n\n[[B]]."}

After simplification, we will compare the outcomes.\n\n#### Problem (1): !(p>(p|q))&r\n\nFirst, simplify the expression inside the not operator `!`:\n1. Recognize `p > (p | q)` is equivalent to `(p | q) & !p` via the implication equivalence (Equivalence 10).\n   - Thus, our expression simplifies to: `!( (p | q) & !p ) & r`.\n2. Apply negation distribution (`&` distributes over `!`):\n   - This gives: `(!p | !((p | q))) & !(!(!p)) & r`.\n3. Simplify `!(! (!p))` (through double negation):\n   - Reduces to: `(!p | !((p | q))) & !p & r`.\n4. Apply De Morgan's law to `!((p | q))`:\n   - This gives: `(!p | !q) & !p & r`.\n5. Now, generalize this simplification to follow the pattern of equivalence others might yield: \n   - Result: `(!p & r) | (!p & !q) & r`.\n\nSo, the equivalent expression for Problem (1) is `(!p & r) | (!p & !q) & r`.\n\nAfter simplifying and comparing similar steps, we have the formula for Problem (1).\n\n#### Problem (2): p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)\n\nStart decomposition:\n1. The inside complex part `((p | q) & !p) > q` conforms to implication axiom:\n   - We know `A > B` is equivalent to `!(A & !B)`: `!( !p & (p | q) & !q )`.\n2. Moving onto simplification with De Morgan's laws:\n   - This gives: `!( (q | !q) & !p ) & p`.\n3. Recognizing `(q | !q)` simplifies to `1` (since `q` or `!q` is always true):\n   - The expression simplifies further to: `!(!p) & p`.\n4. Applying double negation on `!(!p)`:\n   - Reduces to: `p & p`.\n\nSo, the equivalent expression for Problem (2) is `p & p`, which simplifies further to `p`.\n\n#### Final Answer:\nProblem (1) simplifies to: `(!p & r) | (!p & !q) & r`.\nProblem (2) simplifies to: `p`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is presented as:\n- For Problem (1): `(!p & r) | (!p & !q) & r`\n- For Problem (2): `[p];[]`"}

A. Yes B.

This results in the negation of p in both disjunctions, which is still not logically equivalent to (p>(q|r)), and the disjunction between q and r is also different from the implication p>(q|r). So, the answer to this part is an \"N\" (Nodecimal or False). \n\n(2) For the second equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q), you assess it as follows:\n\nGiven the definitions for implication (10), and the rules for negation and disjunction (7):\nIf p = q then it means !(p-q), which means (p|q) so !(p|q), and also that !(p&q) means ~(p&q). Therefore, !(p|q) & !(p&q) correctly signifies that p is not equal to q. Hence, this equivalence holds true and would be an \"A\" (Answered or True). \n\nSo the correct answer is [[B];[A]] considering the details but, by re-calculating the logical implications more rigorously, given that statement 10 states A > B as !(A | B), and for negation of A = B as !(A & B), statement 2 proves the equivalence correctly. Which means, there was a mistake in the cautious initial assessment steps, and on re-evaluation, both equivalences hold true, which should be [[A];[A]], leading me to adjust this answer to match the direct conclusion from the 16 Basic Equivalences accurately."}

It represents \"not (A or B)\", which is logically equivalent to \"not A and not B\".\n\n2. **Applying to the given equivalences**:\n   - **(1) (p⇓q)⇓r ::=:: p⇓(q⇓r)**:\n     - On the left (`(p⇓q)⇓r`), we apply the definition of NAND to find that its truth value is `!(p | q)` and then `!(!(p | q) | r)`. Simplifying with boolean algebra, we want to prove that `!(p | q) & !(r) == p & !q & !(r)`.\n     - On the right (`p⇓(q⇓r)`), we do similar steps: `!(p | !(q | r))` becomes `!(p | (!(q | !r)))`. We aim to show that `p & !(q | r) == p & !(q & !(r))`.\n     - After simplification and evaluation of the NAND operations, it becomes immediately clear that direct logical equivalences don't hold between `!(p | q) & !(r)` and `p & !(q & !(r))` without further context on the relationship of p, q, and r. Therefore, this equivalence is not valid universally.\n     - Hence, the answer for **(1)** is No, symbolized as `B`.\n\n3. **Applying the same approach to (2) (p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: p⇑(q⇑r)**:\n   - **NOR (⇓)** is defined as `!(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B`. We're aiming to determine if `!(p & q) & !(r) == !(p & !(q & r))` holds for all p, q, and r.\n   - Applying the logic and simplification for both sides as in **(1)**, it is clear that achieving such direct equivalences is not straightforward without specific values for p, q, and r, and thus, showing the logical structure matches exactly isn't evident. Verification under all possible logical combinations of p, q, and r is required to show formal equivalence, which doesn't directly fit into given rules without context.\n   - Therefore, similarly to **(1)**, the answer for **(2)** is also No, represented by `B`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the complexity introduced by NAND (`⇑`) and NOR (`⇓`) operations and the lack of straightforward simplifications that match the provided equivalences, both statements are evaluated to be false (B) under the conditions given. Therefore, the final answer is `[[B];[B]]`."}

Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To tackle this question, we need to understand the given logical expressions and make deductions based on Professor Wang's remarks. \n\nGiven logical expressions:\n- If one person gave everything right, then their expressions (B1, C1, D1) must be true under the circumstances that one of p,q,r is true and the other two are false. Thus:\n    - B1, C1, D1 imply that p being true leads to a contradiction (which is not the case here as we're dealing with conditional truths based on person statements), and the respective true statements align with each person's claim.\n\n- If one person got half everything right, then their expressions (B2, C2, D2) turn out to be true given the condition of one true statement among the options. \n\n- Similarly, one person got everything wrong implies their expressions (B3, C3, D3) correctly represent the false outcomes.\n\nWe need to interpret the fact that one expressed everything correctly, one half right, and one half wrong logically. Let's make the logical associations:\n\n- Considering Professor Wang's statement about one receiving everything correct, one half correct, and one receiving everything wrong: this directly aligns with a binary classification of correct/partial/incorrect with the highest degree first, i.e., one gets the verdicts 0, 1, and 2 respectively. Expressing it in more formal terms could be connected with using true XOR (exclusive or) to denote the concept of half correct, thinking that the relationship should fall within the scope where a unilateral shift in truth/antithesis cases aligns with the predefined \"half correct\" criteria.\n\n- For E, it simplifies to (!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nConsidering how the attributes are connected:\n- If p is true (Suzhou?), then q and r are false. This would imply:\n   - A is correct (not from Suzhou), but incorrect regarding where he's from (Shanghai). \n   - B is incorrect since he's wrong on both assumptions he makes. \n   - C is incorrect since he contradicts A (he claims Wang is from Shanghai).\n\n- For B to be partially correct:\n   - Assuming q is true (Shanghai?), and p, r are false. Thus B's outcome narrows the focus to finding a mix of correct and false claims such that only one statement aligns with the final outcome after considering the XOR truth condition in a literal sense, which potentially means one person's \"half correct\" interpretation demands a balanced approach not fitting our short vector of alrightness conditions leading toward a logical 0-not half right channel initiated basis simpler logic where B's statement is literally true around parts his claims.\n\n- If r is true (Hangzhou?):\n   - Person A is incorrect, as per the earlier deductions, because his claim aligns with Wang being from Hangzhou.\n   - Person B is incorrect if r is true, because B claims that Wang is from Suzhou in contrast.\n   - This strategy aligns with our goals where r's truth inescapably makes A incorrect for declaring \"not from Suzhou\", exhibited as correct based upon the connecting arguments where the \"options\" effectively drop from consideration to pinpoint the truth as r leads logically directly under our set inquiry.\n\nOverall, interpret the deductions accordingly:\n[[Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: C]; [partially correct: B]; [entirely incorrect: A]]."}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step according to the given rules and logic.\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the Propositional Variables and Their Negations\nThe given propositional variables are p, q, and r.\n\n- The negation of p is ¬p.\n- The negation of q is ¬q.\n- The negation of r is ¬r.\n\n#### Step 2: Construct Paired Conjunctive and Disjunctive Terms\nWe are given the expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r). We need to construct the paired conjunctive and disjunctive terms.\n\n**Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n1. Each term is formed by multiplying the negation of all variables that are in both the expressions AND the variables that are negated in one expression but not in the other.\n2. For (¬p^¬q^r), all variables are involved and their exact negation/positive state is known directly from the expression, hence no pairing with other expressions is needed for it to form a paired conjunctive term.\n3. Similarly, (¬p^q^r) also forms a part of the paired conjunctive term, involving all variables with their states as indicated.\n\nThe paired conjunctive term combination derived from these two expressions is p·q·r.\n\n**Paired Disjunctive Term:**\nFor the disjunctive normal form part of the given expression, there is only one term, which remains as it is.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- Paired Conjunctive Term: p·q·r\n- Paired Disjunctive Term (unchanged): (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r)\n\n#### Step 3: Denotation of the Paired Conjunctive Terms\n- The given expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) represents the union of two conjunctive terms, where the first term has all variables and the second term has a mix of variables in their negated and non-negated form.\n- The binary representation is calculated by considering the truth values of p, q, and r in each term of the disjunctive normal form and then combining them:\n    - For p when false (0) and q when false (0) and r when true (1), the binary representation is 001 (since none of the variables in (¬p)^q^r is true in this term).\n    - For p when false (0), q when true (1) and r when true (1), the binary representation is 011 (p is false, q is true, r is true).\n\nCombining, we get the overall true assignment of this disjunctive normal form, which can be interpreted as a binary number under the premise provided. However, since we've identified an error in the given rule, let's correct our understanding based on the interpretation of the conjunctive terms:\n- The correct denotation for p·q·r, considering the pairing (which was misinterpreted as a disjunctive term's truth value directly in the given rule), is not directly derived from a hexadecimal number by combining the binary representations as initially misstated.\n- Correctly, p·q·r corresponds to hexadecimal i (where i is the value representing the true assignment of this specific combination in binary form). In this case, since p, q, and r in exactly this configuration are all considered true/1, the binary representation of p·q·r is 111 (treatment as a disjoint union leads to confusion; the essence here is identifying true and false literals form of pqr under conjunction context).\n\n#### Correct Composition of Answer:\n[[paired conjunctive term: p·q·r; disjoint union Confederation: (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r)],[denoted: m7]] \n\nBased on the correct interpretation, the expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) actually corresponds directly to the single formula made out of all literals (p, q, r), which when considered together form `p·q·r` due to the conjunction operation not being interpreted as a disjunctive term operation but as part of the construction of the principle conjunction.\n\nFinal Correct Answer: [[paired conjunctive term: p·q·r; disjoint union Confederation: (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r)],[denoted: m7]]."}

Each conjunction is a term called a clause. In the given formula, there are two clauses:\n\n1. ¬p∧¬q∧r\n2. p∧q∧r\n\nNow let's convert these clauses into their corresponding hexadecimal terms according to the rule, using the format mi for true assignments and Mi for false assignments.\n\nFor the true assignment:\n- The first clause, ¬p∧¬q∧r, results in a binary number: 000 (for ¬p, ¬q) + 1 (for r) = 001 = 1 in binary = 1 in hexadecimal = m1.\n- The second clause, p∧q∧r, results in a binary number: 1 (for p) + 1 (for q) + 1 (for r) = 111 = 7 in binary = 7 in hexadecimal = m7.\n\nSo, the DNF consists of m1 and m7.\n\nFor the false assignment:\n- To find the false assignment, we look for the positions of the variables being false (not present in the clauses). In this case, all variables are present in the clauses, so the false assignment does not directly correlate to the given format.\n\nFor identifying the type of formula:\n- Since this DNF includes m1 (which is for i=1) and m7 (which is for i=7), there is no overlap between odd and even indices. Therefore, it cannot be an all-even or all-odd formula.\n- It includes more than 2^0 (t) terms (2 terms here), which means it cannot be a basic formula based on that rule.\n- Without specific information about the structure of formula A that includes all 2^n terms or has none of the terms, we can't immediately conclude it is a tautology or a contradiction.\n\nThus, the answer format is [[C]]. (Selected as it includes more than one clause, making it not a basic formula, while leaving other classifications undefined without additional information about the formula itself.)"}

If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we need to break down the given formula (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r) and see its parity and truth assignment in binary form.\n\n1. For (p∨r), it's true when p is true (first proposition), when r is true (second proposition), or both. So, it corresponds to binary 11 and hexadecimal 3, which is represented as m3 when in principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n2. Moving to (¬q∨r), when q is false (0 in binary) and r is true, this results in truth (1 in binary). Therefore, for q being false (the first proposition) and r being true (second proposition), it's m1. For r being false (the first proposition) and q being true (second proposition), it's m5 (because the binary number increases by shifting the 1 when the order of propositions changes).\n\n3. For (¬p∨q∨¬r), it's tricky. This could be true when p is false (0 in binary), when q is true (making the second proposition true), or when r is false (the first proposition being the only one that matters). It corresponds to binary 111 (11 + 1 = 3 + 2^1), and in hexadecimal, it corresponds to 7, represented as M7.\n\nNow we see that:\n\n- m3 is included (for p∨r)\n- m1 is included (for ¬q∨r when q is false and r is true)\n- m5 is included (for ¬q∨r when r is false and q is true)\n- M7 is included (for ¬p∨q∨¬r)\n\nThis formula is consistent in either principal disjunctive or conjunctive normal form because it includes both conjunctive and disjunctive terms following the pattern correctly outlined by the rule. \n\nTherefore, the formula (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r) conforms to both principal disjunctive normal form and principal conjunctive normal form.\n\nOutput: [[A];[Since it conforms to both, it cannot be denoted as a specific type without additional context, but it could be represented using the formulas provided.

The answer format is [[]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Formula A is a tautology**: This means that it includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, where n is the number of propositional variables in the formula. For the given case, n = 4, so 2^n equals 2^4 = 16 paired conjunctive terms. A tautology is a formula that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its variables.\n\n2. **Formula A is a basic formula**: This indicates that it includes m0, which is one of the paired conjunctive terms denoted based on the truth assignment that corresponds to the binary number equal to hexadecimal number 0.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information:\n\n- Formula A includes all 16 paired conjunctive terms of the principal disjunctive normal form, making it a tautology.\n- It specifically includes m0.\n\nSince a tautology contains all possible truth assignments (which can be seen as including all paired conjunctive terms, as they represent all possible combinations of truth values for the 4 variables), and a basic formula necessarily includes m0, the formula A in this case is denoted as:\n\n```\n[[]] (m0)\n```"}

The resolution does not apply directly in this case because we are dealing with disjunctive clauses and not applying the resolution rule against the same clause.\n   - For `¬r` in `C2`, again, taking `s ∨ ¬t` leaves the same result as in step 3 because we're interested in the result of `¬r`.\n\n5. **Combine Results**: From steps 3 and 4, we have multiple sets of potential results. However, since resolution only directly applies between pairs of clauses in terms of extracting common literals, the final step is to combine the results directly obtained which are `r` and `s ∨ ¬t`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the requested format is `[[r], [s ∨ ¬t]]`."}

According to the rule, if a pair of clauses share a pair of complementary literals (one literal and its negation), then they can be resolved into a new clause that contains the remaining literals from both clauses.\n\nGiven the clauses:\n- C1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬s\n- C2 = s\n\nWe can see that C2 contains the literal `s`. Since there is no opposing literal `¬s` in C2, we cannot directly resolve C1 and C2 because we don't have complementary literals to cancel out in the resolution step. The resolution rule applies only when a pair of clauses have complementary literals.\n\nTherefore, when resolving C1 and C2, the resulting clause `C` is calculated as the disjunction of the literals that are not cancelled out. Here, `s` is the only literal in C2 that is not complemented in C1. Since we have no other literals in either clause that cancel each other out, there is no resolution to perform, and the result is just C2, which is `s`.\n\nSo, `dispel(C1, C2) = s`.

Expression (¬p ∨ q) is one clause, expression (p ∨ q) is another, and since (q) is a tautology (always true), it doesn't add new information but can be considered as adding the variable \"q\" in a trivial manner. Therefore, S1 = {[¬p ∨ q], [p ∨ q], [q]}.\n  - S2: Also initially an empty set (unprocessed resulting clauses from previous steps).\n\n### Step 2: First Loop Iteration - Resolving Clauses in S0 and S1\n\nAfter the first loop, the focus is on resolving non-reusable clauses from S0 (which, as we are starting, will always be empty in the initial sweep) with all clauses in S1.\n\n#### Check for Resolvability between [¬p ∨ q] in S0 and each clause in S1:\n\n- Resolving [¬p ∨ q] in S0 with [p ∨ q] in S1 is possible, since the ¬p in [¬p ∨ q] can be resolved with the p in [p ∨ q], leading to the truth (0), because one side becomes ¬\\(\\bot\\) or \\(\\top\\), making the evaluation 0 (implies \"Implausible\").\n- S2 now contains the result of this form of resolution: {0}.\n\n#### Then, Check for Resolvable Pairs in S1:\n\n- Resolving any combination within S1 does not result in 0, as all pairs will be in the form of resolving a clause with itself or with a clause where the variables are not exactly opposite. Thus, no new contradictions arise, and the loop would normally proceed until S2 is checked.\n- Notably, since resolving a clause with itself is undefined in this context, we do not add any new elements to S2 during this process.\n\n### Final Check on S2\n\n#### After the first loop's conclusion:\n- S2 ends up being {0} because the potentially resolvable clause [¬p ∨ q] resolved with [p ∨ q] directly returned 0, indicating an \"Implausible\" scenario would occur if S1's clauses were independent of S0.\n\nLet's summarize the final states:\n- S0: Stays empty as expected, no new simple disjunctive clauses have been added from operations in the loop.\n- S1: Remains {[¬p ∨ q], [p ∨ q], [q]} as no operations that could affect its state from S0 took place.\n- S2: After the first loop, becomes {0}, indicating an immediate “Implausible” finding.\n\n### Final Representation:\n- S0: ∅\n- S1: {[¬p ∨ q], [p ∨ q], [q]}\n- S2: {0}\n\n### Explanation of First Loop Iteration's S2 End State:\n- The immediate resolution of any compatible clauses between S0 and S1 resulted in a truth value of 0 (implying the original statements in combination are unsatisfiable), thus triggering the algorithm to output \"Implausible\" before further iterations could resolve the remaining clause or clauses in S1.\n\n### Answer Format:\n```\n[∅; {[¬p ∨ q], [p ∨ q], [q]}; {0}]\n```"}

In this step, look for two clauses that contain complementary literals.\n\n#### Iteration 1:\n- $C1 = p$ , $C3 = p ∨ ¬q$ (Resolve): $C = p ∨ ¬q$\n- Since $C$ contains literals that are not complementary with any literals in the current sets, add $C$ to $S_2$.\n- Reset $S_1$ with only the clauses not resolved yet: $S_1$ = {$C2$, $C4$, $C5$}\n- Add $C = p ∨ ¬q$ to $S_0$ (since we need a new clause to resolve something within it for each iteration).\n\n### Step 4: Resolving Clauses in $S_1$\n- $C2 = p ∨ q$ , $C4 = q ∨ ¬r$ (Resolve): $C = p ∨ ¬r$\n- Add $C = p ∨ ¬r$ to $S2$.\n\n### Step 5 (Recalculation): Resolving Clauses again in $S_0$ and $S_1$:\nNow $S_0$ and $S_1$ include the newly added clauses. Look for resolutions again:\n\n#### Iteration 2:\n- $C_0 \\in S_0 = p ∨ ¬q$ invariants, no resolution with $S_1$'s set.\n- $C_1 \\in S_0 = p ∨ ¬r$, unable to resolve with $S_1$ based on current elements. Add this to $S_2$ to be resolved again if required.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe algorithm will only iterate twice based on the logic. The first iteration fully resolves potential clauses, and the second only involves $C_1$ from $S_0$, waiting for possible resolution with future $S_1$ sets, which in this case won't happen until $S_2$ has exhausted its elements from the next iteration. However, since $S_2$ isn't empty, the third iteration is also performed, though redundant based on the explanation so far, this theoretically would also resolve $C_1$ from $S_0$ to a final state.\n\n### Final Output:\nAs $S_2$ ends up empty after two iterations, indicating that the initial sets of clauses were fully resolved, the output will be “Plausible”.\n\n### Final Answer:\nIn this context, the answer format notation asks for the output of the algorithm and the number of cycles that it runs to complete its process. Based on the detailed iterative process laid out above, adhering to the format specifically indicated in the output request, the answer would be:\n\n```\n[[Plausible]; [2]]\n```\n\nThis reflects the resolution algorithm's final output of \"Plausible\" after iterating through processes that effectively identify a satisfying assignment through the methodical resolution of disjunctive clauses in the conjunctive normal form."}

Thus, the circuit output represents ¬(p∧q) when p is not powered and q is powered (a powered output).\n  - When q is not powered and p is powered, same logic applies: NAND gate outputs a powered signal. \n  - When both p and q are powered, p∧q would be powered. The NAND gate, which acts as NOT gate when both inputs are powered, outputs a non-powered signal (false). The negation of this, ¬(p∧q), is powered.\n  - When both p and q are not powered, p∧q is non-powered.

This process gives us `F(fJ(x, 0), y)` and further `F(gJ(x, y), z)`.\n\n### Step 3: Replace 𝑛-ary function symbols 𝑔 in 𝐵 with g𝐽\nNow we replace `fJ(x, 0)` with `(x + 0)` because `fJ(x, y) = x + y`. Similarly, replace `gJ(x, y)` with `(x * y)`.\n\n### Step 4: Replace 𝑛-ary predicate symbols 𝑅 in 𝐵 with R𝐽\nThe predicate `FJ(x, y)` means `x = y`.

However, the transition point applies only when each part is replaced with 2 times, not individually in the entire formula.\n\n#### Formula 2 Implementation:\n- Replace x with a′ (2) in the first part of the implication.\n- Replace x with 2 in the first f(x, a), resulting in f(2, a) → 2 + a.\n- Replace y with b (which we found to be 2 + a in the first part) in the second part of the implication.\n- Replace x with 2 + (2 + a) = 4 + a in the second part of the implication.\n\nSo, the implementation of the second formula is:\n- Implication: ∃n(F(f(n, a), n) → ∃b(F(f(b, a), 2 + a))\n\nHowever, the second formula implementation contains a logical misinterpretation due to the misunderstanding of the application of the replacements during the reasoning. For correct implementation, instead:\n\nLet's correct the implementation:\n\n### Corrected Answer:\n\nFormula 1: ∀xF(g(x,a),x)\n- Implementing with a′ = 2: ∀n(F(fJ(n, 2), n))\n\nFormula 2: ∃xF(f(x,a),y)→∃yF(f(y,a),x)\n- Implementing with a′ = 2 and considering only the variable x and b where b = x + 2:\n  - ∃n(F(fJ(n, 2), n) → ∃b(F(fJ(b, 2), 2 + n))\n\nThus, the corrected implementation is:\n\n[[\"∀n(F(fJ(n, 2), n)\"), [\"∃n(F(fJ(n, 2), n) → ∃b(F(fJ(b, 2), 2 + n))\"]]"}

Since no exceptions are allowed in \"All S are P,\" there cannot be any that do not belong to P, making SOP false.\n\n2. **If the proposition SIP is true (i.e., \"Some S are P\") is true, then the proposition SEP (i.e., \"No S are P\") must be false.**\n   - SIP acknowledges there is at least one element in S that is also in P, which directly contradicts SEP's claim that no elements in S are in P. Hence, when SIP is true, SEP cannot be true.\n\n3. **If the proposition SIP is false (i.e., \"Some S are not P\") is false, then the proposition SEP (i.e., \"No S are P\") must be true.**\n   - If it's not the case that some elements in S do not also belong to P, then none of the elements in S can be said to not belong to P. This means that SEP, which claims that no elements in S are in P, would align with this truth since it meets the lower requirement of not claiming any exceptions.\n\n4. **If the proposition SOP is false (i.e., \"Some S are not P\") is false, then the proposition SAP (i.e., \"All S are P\") must be true.**\n   - When SOP states that there are no elements in S that do not belong to P, it cannot be false. Therefore, if SOP is not false (i.e., it is true), it confirms that all elements in S are actually in P, aligning with SAP's claim that everything in S is P."}

This is because there cannot be any individual businesses that are tax payers (all are not) if there exists at least one individual business that has paid taxes. If some individual businesses have paid taxes, Inspector A cannot be correct, since A would define a set with no exceptions at all.\n  \n- **Pair 2: Inspector A (SAP) vs. Inspector D (SOP)**\n  - Inspector D's statement is a Particular Negative (SOP): \"Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\"\n  - Relationship between SAP and SOP: **%/&/%**\n    - These are % propositions as well. If Inspector A is correct (universal negative, no exceptions), then Inspector D must also be correct (particular negative, some exceptions), because A defines a set without any exceptions, and D identifies subsets within that set which do not satisfy the majority condition.\n\n- **Pair 3: Inspector C (SIP) vs. Inspector D (SOP)**\n  - Here, SIP and SOP are contradictory statements. If Inspector C is correct (some individual businesses have paid taxes), then Inspector D cannot be correct (some individual businesses have not paid taxes), and vice versa.

When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words.

For a universal affirmative proposition (A \"All S is P\"), after obversion, we get \"All non-S is not P\" (\"All incorrect reasoning is not formally correct reasoning\").\n\n- **Conversion** in this context refers to Method B described above (swapping subject and predicate). After obversion, converting to make inference about 'formally correct reasoning' as the subject would provide logical propositions with respect to the subject.\n\n### Final Method Selection and Inference Process:\nGiven the nature of transforming the proposition, Method C seems most appropriate:\n\n1. **Obversion of \"All correct reasoning is formally correct reasoning\" gives \"All incorrect reasoning is not formally correct reasoning\".**  \n2. **Conversion** takes \"All incorrect reasoning is not formally correct reasoning\" and transforms it into a form about \"formally correct reasoning\". Specifically, Method B (Direct Applicative Analogy) applied here would be less pertinent, but Method C helps direct transformation, ideally akin to assessing how incorrect reasoning relates to not being formally correct through negation and exchange rather than a direct applicative analogy to formally correct reasoning. However, since the primary question focuses on applying the methods to form an inferential proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject starting from a given universally affirmative proposition directly about \"All correct reasoning\" leading to \"All formally correct reasoning\", Method B would not be theoretically applicable for an exact fit but was discussed in the context of transformation. \n3. Thus, Method C, involving precise moves like Obversion followed by a form of conversion tailored to inferential operation within the scope of altering statement structure while potentially preserving or inferring through transformation, technically offers a systematic way to logically address the question or purpose of transforming affirmatives into relevant inferential propositions with a specified subject relationship.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[C]]. This indicates to apply Method C with specific steps of obversion first, followed by conversion tailored to establish logical inference starting with the given universal affirmative proposition about 'All correct reasoning' leading to propositions about 'formally correct reasoning' as the subject. While not prescribed by step-by-step actions of A/B/C as directly aligning with an option letter choice, the chosen method C underlines the structured logical transformation and inference process as requested, fittingly so within the context of the question's guidelines."}

However, the direct correspondence is not straightforward because a syllogism typically involves statements in a specific form (such as AAA, EAE, AII, EIO, AEO, etc.) rather than having all quantifiers \"∀\" or \"∃\" across the propositions.\n\nLet's break down the given argument and see if it matches any of the valid moods for Figure IV:\n\n- The first proposition (∀P⇒M) is a necessary condition (A: ∀p1⇒p2).\n- The second proposition (∀M⇒¬S) negates a consequent (E: ∀p1⇒¬p2).\n- The conclusion (∀S⇒¬P) follows from the previous propositions.\n\nGiven that:\n- The argument goes from a necessary condition (A) to a negative consequent (E) and then to the negation of the initial antecedent (A), indicating a structure that might match valid moods in the context of a logical argument.\n- The valid moods for Figure IV involve conditions such as AEE (All first propositions are true, and if the last proposition is an affirmative conditional, the mood is AEE; the last proposition can also be an \"if-not\" conditional, which fits here), EAE (All first propositions are false, and the last proposition is affirmative), AOO (All first propositions are true, and the last proposition is an \"if-not\" conditional), and more specifically here, EIO (A negative first proposition leads to a positive conditional on the last).\n\nGiven the structure and rules provided, a potential interpretation could be that the argument adheres to the EIO mood for Figure IV (as the sequence starts with a universal negative, followed by a universal to a particular negation, and finally leads to a particular negation), even though it directly skips intuitively over the enumeration of valid moods, as commonly seen in the nuances of formal logic and its application.\n\nThus, the answer to the question, considering the informal interpretation tailored to align with the logic regime described:\n\n[[IV];[EIO]]"}

So, \\(M()P\\) becomes \\(∀P\\).\n\nFor \\(S()M\\), we can infer \\(∃S\\) corresponds to \\(S()\\) in Figure I, aligning with the existence of something \\(S\\). So, \\(S()M\\) becomes \\(∃S⇒M\\).\n\nFor the conclusion: \\(S()P\\), it directly aligns with the given conclusion in our logic problem.\n\nFrom the respective valid moods, for Figure I, \\(A\\) can form \\(AAA\\), \\(EAE\\), \\(AII\\), and \\(EIO\\), but since there's a negative consequent involved (implied by \\(AII\\) and \\(EIO\\)), the most suitable mood for the given first statement \\((\\text{universal } P, \\text{universal }\\neg M)\\) and seeking \\((\\text{some }S, \\text{some }\\neg P)\\) that match logically is \\(AAA\\), given the structure provided (without a direct match conceptually within Figure I's moods directly stated, yet working structurally due to universal to existential implications).\n\nFootnote on Mood for Figure I: \\(AAA\\) corresponds well since it involves a universal antecedent (\\(A\\) statement) and leads to a universal consequent (\\(AII\\), \\(EIO\\)), but directly fits conceptually because it implies a scenario (universal implies universal) that aligns closely with the structure.\n\nFor Figure II:\n- As noted, the form would be \\(P()M\\).\n- \\(∃S\\) and \\(∃S\\) indicates existential quantification applied to both premises although the structure doesn't fit neatly into the mood due to the logical conclusion, seeking universal from existential, but for the sake of fitting the statement and mood descriptionquesttion context scenario study might abstract to a scenario fitting II mood for Structural based form, though direct moods are not provided fitting tightly with the input as directly as I does with explanation.\n\nHence:\n\n[Figure]: I\n[Mood]: AAA is the best abstract fit considering the mood descriptions and logical structuring towards generating a classically expected syllogistic interpretation validly meeting the criteria and construct that results concordantly with the provided statements.\n\n[You were asked to provide the mood for a form specific to Figure II, which involves different quantifications than in Figure I and requires explication akin to Figure I's process for a standard format answer, hence noting in-conformative the theoretical mood fitting or creativity explorations required would have followed making a distinct breakdown for II's form contemplating Alignments for AA, EE, EI, AO based more narrowly— Instructive for deeper exploration/ creative fit in syllogistic logic answers under finer logical constructs.]\n\nSo considering the context of the outlined description and looking towards a harmonious fit in response by answering a question under framed fabricated context for degree of answers (specification format isn't provided for II directly, delving into the broader underlying mood notions fits interpreting structurally the wider response):\n\n**Answer:** [[I];[AAA]]"}

The representation is `A`, as it resembles `AaE` in syllogistic form, which simplifies to `A` in the object given rules. This premise suggests a rule like \"For all X, if X has property P, then X has property M.\"\n2. `∃S⇒¬M`: This can be translated as O: property S implies not M, also fitting into Figure I. The representation is `O`, similar to `OaI` which simplifies to `O`. This premise might be understood as \"There exists something that, if it has property S, does not have property M.\" \n3. `∃S⇒¬P`: This directly represents E: property S implies not P, fitting into Figure II, as it's an existential quantifier leading to a negation in the consequent. The representation is `E`, related to `EiO` or `EIO`, simplified to `E`.\n\nGiven the form of the argument (using the properties as premises and aiming to prove a relation between S and P), the argument falls under `Figure II`.\n\nTo determine the mood, we follow the logic steps:\n- `∀P⇒M` (A) | `∃S⇒¬M` (O) | `∃S⇒¬P` (E)\n- `A × O = E`: This step reflects the syllogistic inference, where a universal (A) and an existential (O) lead to an existential (E) conclusion. However, the specific mood is determined by how these premises interact rather than a direct multiplication of their types.\n- `EIO`: Given the premises are in A and O (which after simplification is E), the corresponding mood validates the structure as `EIO` in standard syllogistic logic.\n\nTherefore, the syllogism corresponds to [[II];[EIO]]."}

Therefore, the second premise should maintain this particularity if the conclusion (∴S()P) is also supposed to be particular or indicative of a specific situation without being universal. This guides us toward choosing a mood where the middle term in the second premise implies a relationship that can lead to a specific situation, which corresponds to a particular mood.\n\nFor the conclusion S()P, to maintain the structure of the given syllogism setup and adhere to the rules given, we want an IAI or OAO mood, which can transition from the M()S premise to the S()P conclusion and still allow the main premise (MIP) to logically fit into this structure based on the relationship it outlines.\n\nConsidering the particular nature of both premises and aiming for a specific (non-universal) conclusion, the best choice given the validity rules and the question's intent is the IAI mood.\n\nThus, the filled-in syllogism would look like this:\nMIP\nM()I\n∴S()P\n\nIn the requested format [[];[]], the answer is formatted as:\n\n[AII;IAI]"}

In modal logic, we can represent this with #p, signifying necessity or possibility to be a truth based on current knowledge or conditions.\n- **Sentence 2**: \"The Chinese women's volleyball team may not win\". This can be represented as $¬p, which means possibility that the proposition is false. Here, the team not necessarily defeating does not mean it definitely loses; there's still a possibility or uncertainty.\n\n**Properties**:\n- They cannot both be true or false (as the team cannot both be definitely victorious and may not win at the same time). Therefore, it fits the @ relationship (cannot both be false).\n\n### (2) \"This project will definitely be completed ahead of schedule\" and \"This project will definitely not be completed ahead of schedule.\"\n\n- **Sentence 1**: \"This project will definitely be completed ahead of schedule\".

If one is a necessity (necessarily true or ahead of schedule), the other being a necessity (the opposite) cannot be simultaneously true or false.

Modal logic manipulates modal operators to express necessity (\\(\\#\\)) and possibility (\\($\\) or \\(\\$\\)).\n\n### Analysis:\n\nWe are comparing:\n\\[ \\neg (\\#H \\land \\#L) \\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\neg (\\$H \\land \\$L) \\]\n\nLet's consider the implications on modal operators based on the properties outlined:\n(1) 'Necessarily' pairs of propositions (\\(#p, \\$¬p, \\$p, #¬p\\) can operate under different conditions.)\n(2) 'Possibly' pairs of propositions operate more permissively.\n\nThe transformation:\n\\[ (\\#H \\land \\#L) \\rightarrow (\\$H \\land \\$L) \\]\n\nimplies a switch from modal 'necessity' to modal 'possibility' for both propositions which is not listed among the inference formulas directly.

The given set does not bear direct formulas for such operations as a direct mapping between the negation of superconditions of intuitive necessity to its complementary possibility under their modal relations if viewed against the context provided non rigorous rules; so, as provided, we identify the implication as introducing a substitution between equivalent modal quantity expressions as implicitly created by understanding the given rule's definition and identifying similarity to the understanding of negation across modal contexts as:\n\n### Answer:\n[No direct formula]"}

According to the given logic rules and definitions, abuse can be categorized as prohibition (‽), while \"allowing\" something might be translated as negation of prohibition (¬‽). Therefore, not allowing abuse can be symbolized as not prohibiting it.\n\nLet's break down the symbols and propositions:\n\n1. **p**: \"abuse the elderly\"\n2. **q**: \"abuse women\"\n3. **r**: \"abuse children\"\n\nThe key phrase \"is not allowed\" or \"is prohibited\" corresponds to prohibition of each of these acts. According to logic rule (4), which defines the % relationship (both can be true and false), abusing elderly, women, and children together is prohibited.\n\nLet's apply the reasoning:\n\n- Each act of abuse (p, q, r) is prohibited: ‽p, ‽q, and ‽r.\n- The prohibition of actions (effectively negating those actions) is represented as not prohibiting them: ¬‽p (negation of ‽p), ¬‽q, ¬‽r.\n\nTaking these steps, we can summarize the symbolism as:\n\n- **¬‽p**: \"not abusing the elderly\"\n- **¬‽q**: \"not abusing women\"\n- **¬‽r**: \"not abusing children\"\n\nTo encapsulate the proposition \"Abuse of the elderly, women, and children is not allowed\" as a logical expression consisting of its relevant properties and objects, the answer in the specified format is:\n\n[¬‽p, ¬‽q, ¬‽r]\n\nThis means that prohibited actions (abusively targeting elderly, women, and children) are symbolically represented as individually not being allowed."}

To align with this logical fitting, it behaves more like a prohibition (`¬组织开展`), although it's not directly a prohibition (`组织开展`) formulated through a clear logical format in its conventional norms.\n\nFor the second sentence pair:\n\n1. \"Not fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" represents §¬p, meaning you're allowed to not fulfill the contract, where the allowance of the opposite action is given (allowed), signaling a permission relating to non-consequence.\n2. \"Fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" represents §p, which is straightforward permission since fulfilling the contract falls within allowed actions, showing that there's permission built into the statement. \n\nBoth pairs follow **% relationship**, which allows for each sentence to be both true or false without direct contradiction as per logical norms (`both can be true, and both can be false`).\n\nTherefore, the answer is **[[D];[D]]** following the relationship as `%` in logic based on the given norms explained earlier."}

This is because prohibition (.Word) implies that something cannot happen or be allowed, and all prohibitions are formally equivalent to negated permissions (Permission's negation).\n\n- Conversely, \"Elder abuse is not allowed\" corresponds directly to \"Elder abuse is prohibited\" because in normative logic, negation of permission directly corresponds to prohibition. This is represented by the logic relationship where obligation on one side and permission on the other can be true or false together. This relationship corresponds to the \"x\" relationship based on the given definitions, denotes that both propositions cannot be true at the same time within their respective modalities, but they do not have exclusive uniqueness to their modality as in \"both cannot be false\" condition, which characterizes \"x\" or \"δ\" logic. \n\nTherefore, the answer in [[number]] format is: [[3]] corresponding to the @ relationship for \"Elder abuse is not allowed\" leading to \"Elder abuse is prohibited\", and the logic circle reminds us that both relationships are part of a larger normative symmetry where negated permissions align with prohibitions in a mutual inverse relationship defining areas of liberation and constraint together."}

This seems to align more closely with the \"🔂 Relationship,\" which allows for both statements to be true or false without any specific contradiction, yet in this context, the emphasis on \"permanently\" might suggest they are close to being incorrect for the \" حتRelationship\" (IXEL Relationship), which deals with pairs that cannot both be true or both be false, under the assumption that \"permanently\" changes the complete nature of the action or state.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven this detailed analysis and considering the logical relationships outlined in the provided rule, the applicable answer choice is:\n\n[illation: D;C]"}

This connects back to the necessity operator `[c]φ` when `c` would be another command that leads to `φ` after execution, fitting somewhat with the unusual case of `c*` potentially representing a series of commands being executed repeatedly (`c` being an equivalent to `c*` for this specific purpose).\n\n2. **Formulate Logical Expression**: Based on the rules, particularly the Loop Rule and the Substitution Rule, Alice's belief can be expressed as suggesting the loop `c*` acts as a single command that on each iteration leads to `φ`. The Loop Rule tells us that `[c*]φ` acts like `φ ∨ ([c]φ ∧ φ) ...` in essence, meaning each execution of `c` within `c*` should still lead to the truth of `φ`, which isn't directly given in the typical rules but encapsulates her overall inferred understanding.\n\n3. **Necessity Over Paradigm**: The more straightforward way to interpret and adhere to the rules for her belief is to encapsulate the notion that the loop continues solely based on `φ` being true, equating to the loop continuing only when `φ` holds (`φ` after `[c██]愈发`) and will continue this manner by necessity. Hence, it aligns with `φ` being a condition of execution, repeatedly executing in each step potentially making it embody the belief.\n\nGiven these critical points, the logical expression could be understood as reflecting her belief about `c*` enforcing `φ` perpetually until it's no longer the requirement for continuation given her interpretation of how the loop should function. To directly codify this belief under the given rules, especially due to the absence of a rule for looping directly as described, could yield a reflex either along the lines of `φ ∨ (φ ∧ [c██))?` if interpreting her belief towards iteration's condition being φ's truth. \n\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\text{Answer: } [ \\text{AliceBelief} ]φ = φ ∨ ([c*]φ) \\]\nTaking this contrived example for explanation purpose, considering that `[c*]φ` infers the loop holds `φ` true through each iteration. \n\nHowever, since we lack a rule purely fitting for Alice's belief about the perpetuity of loop execution based on `φ`, the most engaging direct application could be:\n\\[ [c*]φ = φ \\]\nThis represents her understanding that the loop lasts as long as `φ` is true, reflecting the most logarithmic assessment under the constraint of provided rules. This maintains conceptual alignment with her inferred belief in iteration conditions aligning directly with `φ`'s perpetuity.\n\nSo:\n\\[Answer: [AliceBelief]φ = [c*]φ\\]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]"}

In this case, the reasoning is based on the moon lacking the attributes of Atmosphere, Water, and Moderate Temperatures (A, b, c), which are thus -⌘ attributes since Earth has these attributes.\n\nNow, since we don't have explicit attribute D (related to life) stated for Earth, we infer that the comparison implicitly or merely counters the positive conditions for life as existing on Earth (with the moon's lack of conditions directly pointed out). Based on the given information and the ⌘ Method, where attributes that are lacking in one object relative to the other are considered -⌘ attributes, \"the absence of life\" could be interpreted as a condition that emerged from the moon lacking some existing conditions for life on Earth.\n\nHowever, the question asked is not whether life is a -⌘ attribute but what kind of attribute \"the absence of life\" is. Since conditions (like atmosphere, water, and moderate temperatures) that are present on Earth are considered -⌘ attributes, the counter condition of the moon lacking life could initial overlap in being viewed as a result of lacking those secondary conditions implying -⌘ attributes. \n\nTherefore, given the missing context directly pointing to explicit +⌘ attributes, and considering logical/syllogistic presets, we place \"the absence of life\" within the positive outcome based on the contrapositive logic invoked through an absence of conditions that lead to a direct outcome (here, life). \n\nBut based on the provided rule for ⌘ Method reasoning, the actual, positively establishing attribute would be a causative correlate or indeed foundational enabling condition logically leading to life existence. Since Earth does harbor natural life in a way that included those -⌘ attributes the Quantifiers Method initially invalidates, the inferred positive correlate or essential enabling attribute that actually being asserted in an existential sense is life itself, may place a subtle tension on direct quantifier or predicate resolution within the immediate syllogism as described.\n\nTo reframe the answer precisely aligning with the provided data and suggestion to confirm explicitly via direct term correlation: The essence— {\"the absence of life\"}— is more directly confirmed to align as a +⌘ attribute underpinning the counter-positive effect or absence of existable conditions enabling life as existing on Earth, given the method's reliance on comparison absence establishing an additional absence condition to logically conclude.\n\nIn accordance with the defined ⌘ Method's operation regarding leveraging presence and absence in establishing a corresponding confirmation within a set, applying this directly for the inclusion of life in its existential sense vis a vis the contrast presented through absence describes would categorize that positive assertion or specific positive condition indeed aligning logically to the bulletpoint of +⌘ as pertaining to existence enabling/bubbling conditions correlative to scrutiny or absence in others.\n\nTherefore, [[B]] - \"the absence of life\" is correctly classified as a +⌘ attribute under the ⌘ Method's operational rules if understood in the context of the enabling conditions for life (ie atmospheric presence, amongst those other conditions like water, moderate temperatures).\n\nThis nuanced approach contextualizes the selective application & transitive consequence within an intuitive but formally rigorous logical compass, anchored precisely in the given method's insights & criteria across the analyzed specimen and contrastive examples intended intersection for quantifier logic determination.\n\n[Answer: [[B]]]"}

Object B: Deep sea, attributes c and d - \"the absence of sunlight\" and \"extreme pressure, low temperatures.\"\n\nIn the ⌘ Method logic, attributes of 'A' that are missing from 'B' are considered -⌘ attributes, and attributes of 'B' that are assumed to be missing from 'A' are treated as +⌘ attributes.\n\nHere, the presence of air and sunlight is an attribute of land ('A'), and since they're missing in the deep sea ('B'), they are considered as -⌘ attributes because they don't exist there.\n\nThe question asks what \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is in relation to the deep sea; since they're absent in it, they are inferred as -⌘ attributes.

Hypothesis (B) \"Penguins are birds\" is a specific instance that falls under the general claim (A).\n3. Given that penguins are birds but they do not fly, the logical consequence of accepting both hypotheses together contradicts our intuitive understanding (specifically, that penguins, being birds, are supposed to fly based on hypothesis A).\n4. This contradiction arises because the initial hypothesis \"All birds fly\" implicitly includes the non-flying penguins as part of its domain of applicability, leading to a logical inconsistency once a specific exception (penguins) is identified.\n\nTherefore, this example illustrates a conflict in accepting multiple hypotheses that collectively lead to a contradiction, which is the essence of the LS (Logic Stability) Paradox."}

Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess is a case in point. Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey. Currently, we must change, make our bodies smaller, but more solid, and we will become invincible.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "This text uses a combination of E+ Method and Metaph+ Method. \n\nFor the E+ Method, the passage uses specific instances like Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess and the story of the \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" to argue for a strategy in dealing with the enemy.

For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\n\"A theft occurred on a school campus, and it is suspected that the suspect is a student within the school.
