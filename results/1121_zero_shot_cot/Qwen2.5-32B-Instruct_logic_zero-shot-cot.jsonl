Therefore:\n\\[ [F_: x|✓|✓] \\]\n\n### (2) Formula: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\nThis formula is a conjunction (&) of two parts:\n- (~p2 || p3)\n- (p1=::>p2)\n\nFor the conjunction to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- First part, ~p2 || p3:\n  - False when p2 is true and p3 is false.\n- Second part, (p1=::>p2):\n  - False when p1 is true (assign ✓) and p2 is false (assign x).\n\nWe need to find assignments that make at least one of the parts false.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n≥1).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as ✓, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,✓|✓|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|✓,x|✓|✓ are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only ✓|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula,\n ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula, \ndetermine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n(2) (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nA.

Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the conditions:\n\n1. **p1=::>(p1||p2)** is a Truth Formula.\n2. **~(p1=::>p2)&p2** is a Falsehood Formula.\n\nWe need to determine the type of the formulas:\n\n(1) **(p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)**\n(2) **(p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)**\n\nLet's analyze each formula.\n\n#### Formula (1):\n**Given as:** (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nSince p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula, it is true under all possible assignments of p1 and p2.\nSince ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula, it is false under all possible assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nSo the formula (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2) is a conjunction of a true statement and a false statement:\n- True conjunction (p1=::>(p1||p2)) with False conjunction (~p1=::>p2&p2) results in a false statement overall because a conjunction is only true if both parts are true.\n\n#### Formula (2):\n**Given as:** (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nAn inclusive disjunction of a True statement (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and a False statement (~p1=::>p2&p2):\n- True statement (p1=::>(p1||p2)) || False statement (~p1=::>p2&p2) results in a true statement overall because a disjunction is true if at least one part is true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n(1) This is a Falsehood Formula.\n(2) This is a Truth Formula.\n\nThe final answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

Start with the left side:\n   ((p>q) & (p>r))\n\n2. Using the equivalence rule (10):\n   ((p>q) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r))\n   \n3. Applying De Morgan's Law (6) and equivalences (5), we can see the relation:\n   (!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n\n4. Next, consider the right side:\n   (p>(q|r))\n\n5. Using rule (10):\n   (p>(q|r)) ::=:: !p | (q | r)\n\n6. Comparing (3) and (5):\n   From these, we cannot conclude equivalence directly as `!p | (q & r)` ≠ `!p | (q | r)`.\n   \nThus, equivalence (1) is **not valid**. The answer for part 1 is B.\n\n### Part 2: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. Begin with the right side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n\n2. The right side is the definition of XOR operation. For !(p=q), we can use the equivalence rule (13):\n   !(p=q) ::=:: !(!p | q) & !(!q | p)\n   \n3. Applying De Morgan's Law (6) to simplify:\n   !(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q\n   !(!q | p) ::=:: q & !p\n\n4. Combining these:\n   !(p=q) ::=:: (p & !q) | (q & !p)\n\n5. The right expression, following the definition of XOR, is consistent with the simplified result. However, the direct representation needs to verify the exact form equivalence from definitions (6) and (11).\n   \n   From rule (11): p=q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p),\n   so !(p=q) ::=:: !((p > q) & (q > p)) ::=:: !(p > q) | !(q > p).\n\n6. Using (10) and applying negation:\n   !(p > q) ::=:: !(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q by De Morgan.\n   Similarly, !(q > p) ::=:: q & !p.\n\n7. Revealing XOR form directly:\n   !(p=q) ::=:: (p & !q) | (q & !p),\n   where (p & !q) | (q & !p) == (p|q)&!(p&q) requires re-expansion and application of rule through cases and De Morgan.\n\nThereby, the second comparison indirectly confirms that !(p=q) absurdly simplified within the XOR principle directly means the expression equivalence stands strongly as defined through logical simplification steps used.\n\nThe final answer is [[B];[A]]."}

By definition, `p⇓q` can be rewritten as `!(p | q)`.\n2. Using the second portion of NOR, `(p⇓q)⇓r` becomes `!((p | q) | r)`.\n3. Applying De Morgan's laws (6th equivalence): `!A | !B ::=:: !(A & B)`, we can further simplify `!((p | q) | r)` into `!(p | q) & !r`.\n4.

Simplify using De Morgan's laws (6th equivalence) to get `!(p | q)` as `!p & !q`.\n5. Therefore, `(p⇑q)⇑r` becomes `(!p & !q) | !r`.\n\n#### Right Side: p⇑(q⇑r)\n1. By definition, `q⇑r` is `!q | !r`.\n2. Thus, `p⇑(q⇑r)` is `!p | !(q⇑r)`.\n3. By our definition, `!(q⇑r)` is `!(q | r)`.\n4. Apply De Morgan's laws, we get `!q & !r`.\n5. Therefore, `p⇑(q⇑r)` becomes `!p | (!q & !r)`.\n\nIt is clear that `(!p & !q) | !r` and `!p | (!q & !r)` are different expressions under our rules, indicating:\n- (2) is also not valid.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven our analysis, both (1) and (2) are not valid equivalences. Thus, the final answer is [[B];[B]]."}

However, since Person B's statement is distinctly in the form of a conjunction (`p&!q`), obtaining half correct would logically fit either `p&!p&!q` (not applicable since p cannot be both true and false) or `p&!q&q` (not applicable either since q cannot be both true and false). Instead, B2 would in this specific logical structure represent the remaining combinations which do not apply directly as per given logic formats. Thus, for a conceptual fulfillment closer to the problem, we can consider it as `!p&!q|p&q` (though not a strict logical split as per the conjunction's direct structure).\n- B3, Person B being entirely incorrect, translates directly to `!p|q`.\n\nFor **Person C**:\n- Person C states \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou,\" corresponding to `!q&!r`.\n- D1, entirely correct, directly translates to `!q&!r`.\n- D2, partially correct. Conceptually, this can mean either part of the conjunction (!q or !r) is true. Hence, it would be represented as `(!q&!r&(q|r))|(q&r)`, however, given the constraint of simplicity, it closely aligns to the condition not directly correlated to conjunction's split logically as above, thus we might simplify conceptually to `q|r`, considering half-true encompasses a direct component.\n- D3, entirely incorrect, translates into `q|r`.\n\nTherefore, following the structured example and the statements' logical representation:\n\n\\[ [[C1=p&!q]; [C2=!p&!q|p&q]; [C3=!p|q]; [D1=!q&!r]; [D2=q|r]; [D3=q|r]] \\]\n\nThis represents each logical condition based on the provided rules and logic transformations."}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired disjunctive terms:...];[denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To address this problem, we first need to understand the expression given: \\( (p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\land (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\). This expression is a conjunction of two disjunctive terms.\n\nLet's analyze the expression step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n   For \\( p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r \\) and \\( \\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r \\) to be true, the possible true assignments would be as follows:\n   - In the case of \\( p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r \\), the expression is true for all values except when \\( p \\) is false, \\( q \\) is false, and \\( r \\) is false, since if all are false (000), the terms involving \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( \\neg q \\) will be true but will not ensure the whole disjunction is false.\n   - Similarly, for \\( \\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r \\), the expression is true for all values except when \\( p \\) is true, \\( q \\) is false, and \\( r \\) is false, as with the previous case, this would make the conjunction false.\n\n2. **Find the Conjunction of the Two Expressions:**\n   Combining these two terms in a conjunction \\( (p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\land (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\), it is only false for the specific cases where each disjunctive term by itself would be false. Otherwise, because of the alternatives within each disjunctive form, it will remain true.\n\n3. **Determine the Binary Representation:**\n   The expression \\( (p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\land (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\) is only false when \\( p = 0, q = 0, r = 0 \\) (binary 000) and when \\( p = 1, q = 0, r = 0 \\) (binary 100). This means the entire expression is false in those cases only.\n\n4. **Denotation Based on False Assignments:**\n   We can now establish the paired disjunctive terms based on the binary numbers: 000 converts to hexadecimal 0, and 100 converts to hexadecimal 4. Thus, the expression corresponds to \\( M0 \\) and \\( M4 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is: [[paired disjunctive terms:M0, M4];[denoted: M0, M4]]."}

If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given logical expression \\((p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r)\\) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) or principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), we need to first identify which form the given expression fits into—disjunctive or conjunctive—and then see if it matches the criteria for PDNF or PCNF respectively.\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the Form\nThe given expression is:\n\\[\n(p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r)\n\\]\nThis is clearly a conjunction (AND) of several disjunctions (ORs), which means it is a conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n\n#### Step 2: Principal Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF)\nThe principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) is defined as a conjunction of all possible paired disjunctive terms. That means we are looking to see if we can express the given CNF as a combination of paired disjunctive terms that meet the given criteria.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate True Assignments\nTo see if our expression is the PCNF, we need to determine if it encompasses all possible true assignments in a form that matches the condition. This means evaluating what assignments of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) make the expression true.\n\nFor \\((p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r)\\):\n- \\((p∨r)\\) is true unless \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) are both false.\n- \\((¬q∨r)\\) is true unless \\(q\\) is true and \\(r\\) is false.\n- \\((¬p∨q∨¬r)\\) is true unless \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) are true and \\(q\\) is false.\n\nThe true assignments for these clauses in combination need to be examined carefully. If we were to list all possible assignments (000, 001, ..., 111 for binary assignments of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\)) and check how many of them make the conjunction true, we would find the appropriate conditions to match the criteria of a principal conjunctive normal form.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the nature of the problem, evaluating each true assignment and verifying the form to see if it conforms to the criteria outlined for a principal conjunctive normal form (which is essentially tracking all valid \\(i\\) values that keep these clauses true in a way that fits the rules for PCNF) can be tedious without a clear enumeration.\n\nHowever, without full enumeration of all assignments, and based on the logical structure and the criteria provided, it is evident that the given expression does not cover all possible paired disjunctive terms that would make it a full PCNF but does qualify for being described in its simplified conjunctive normal form (CNF). Therefore, it is more appropriate here to denote as a specific form without the need to list out all terms in the principal form.\n\nSo, the answer is denoting it by its simplified CNF form does not strictly indicate it solely belongs to a detailed PDNF/PCNF subset but rather is a conjunctive form. \n\n[[B]]"}

For a combination of 4 propositional variables, \\(m0\\) represents the scenario where all variables are false. Thus, out of \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible true assignments (from \\(m0\\) to \\(m15\\)), a basic form must include at least \\(m0\\).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form refers to the condition that the indices of the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form are all even.

In the context of the resolution rule, if L (the literal) in C1 is ¬q, we look for q or ¬¬q (which is the same as q) in C2. However, C2 does not provide a direct complement of ¬q. Thus, ¬q cannot be used to resolve here in a straightforward manner without additional clauses containing the direct complement q.\n    - We also see ¬r in both clauses. ¬r is the same literal in both clauses, hence L = ¬r in C1 is matched with L' = ¬r in C2.\n\n3. **Applying the resolution:**\n    - C1 can be rewritten as C3 ∨ L where L is ¬r, and C3 is ¬p ∨ ¬q.\n    - C2 can be rewritten as C4 ∨ L' where L' is ¬r, and C4 is ¬q ∨ s ∨ ¬t.\n    - Performing dispel(C1, C2) = dispel(¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r, ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t) which, after resolving ¬r (L) and ¬r (L'), yields dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4 = (¬p ∨ ¬q) ∨ (¬q ∨ s ∨ ¬t).\n\n4. **Simplifying the result:**\n    - Combining C3 and C4, we get: ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬q ∨ s ∨ ¬t.\n    - Simplifying, since ¬q ∨ ¬q is the same as ¬q, the simplified result is: ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ s ∨ ¬t.\n\n5. **Putting the answer in the required format:**\n    - Therefore, dispel(C1, C2) gives us the result in the format [[]] as: [¬p, ¬q, s, ¬t].\n\n### Final Answer:\n[¬p, ¬q, s, ¬t]"}

The logical expression is (p∧q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧q)∨(p∨r), and we need to find out what the values of p, q, and r should be for the overall output O to be \"-\".\n\nGiven the expression and the desired output, we want the overall expression to evaluate to false (i.e., not powered or \"-\").\n\n### Step 1: Break down the Expression\n\nWe can divide the expression into three parts:\n\n1. \\(p \\land q \\land \\lnot r\\)\n2. \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\)\n3. \\(p \\lor r\\)\n\nThe full expression is the disjunction (OR) of these three parts. For the disjunction to be false, each part must be false (since only the OR of at least one true part could result in true).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Conditions for Each Part to be False\n\n1. For \\(p \\land q \\land \\lnot r\\) to be false:\n   - At least one of p, q, or (¬r) must be false.\n   - If r is true, then \\(\\lnot r\\) will automatically make the whole statement false regardless of p and q.\n   - If r is false, then both p and q must be false for the whole part to be false.\n\n2. For \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\) to be false:\n   - If p is true, \\(\\lnot p\\) will be false, making the statement false.\n   - Or, if q is false, then regardless of p, the statement will be false.\n\n3. For \\(p \\lor r\\) to be false:\n   - Both p and r must be false.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Feasible Combinations\n\nCombining these conditions, for the overall expression to be false, we could say:\n\n- r must be false (to ensure part 3 is false).\n- Given r is false, p must also be false (again, to ensure part 3 is false).\n- With p as false and r as false, q can only be false to ensure part 2 is false (since \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\) would then become \\(\\lnot False \\land q\\) or True \\(\\land q\\), which needs q to be false).\n\nTherefore, the combination [p=-; q=-; r=-] satisfies all parts of the expression being false, leading to the overall expression being false.\n\nHence, the formatted answer:\n\n[[-;-;-]]"}

Thus, \"All humans breathe\" becomes AxF(x).\n\n2. **Some people write with their left hand.**\n   - Given some people in this set of humans write with their left hand, this follows the format \"Some x in D have property F\", symbolized by ExF(x).\n   - For our case, G(x) means \"x writes with their left hand\".

Symbolically, it is best to state it as \"For all x, if x studies in the United States, it does not necessarily follow that x is Asian\", which is better stated as the negation of the conclusion not being the direct result, symbolized as:\n\\[ A(F(x) & ∼(F(x) ⇒ G(x))) \\]\n- Given the unusual form of this phrase, which suggests the possibility that not all F(x) are G(x), the right symbolization to represent the idea without changing the meaning significantly is:\n\\[ A(F(x) & ∼G(x)) ∪ A(F(x) & G(x)) \\]\nHowever, that would imply at least one F(x) is G(x) and at least one is not, a more straightforward classical interpretation is:\n\\[ A(F(x) ⇒ ∼G(x)) \\]\nBut to closely align with the statement's meaning, we reconsider to:\n\\[ A(F(x) & ∼G(x)) \\]\nto indicate it's not a necessity that all F(x) are G(x).\n\nTherefore, here are the answers in the asked format:\n\n\\[ [A(M(x) ⇒ F(x)); Ex(M(x) & G(x)); Ax(M(x) ⇒ ∼H(x)); A(F(x) & ∼G(x))] \\]\n\nHowever, for clarity and correctness in classical logical interpretation of the final sentence:\n\\[ [A(M(x) ⇒ F(x)); Ex(M(x) & G(x)); Ax(M(x) ⇒ ∼H(x)); Ex(F(x) & ∼G(x))] \\]\n- The final statement accurately addresses the non-necessity aspect."}

The key parts of the sentence are:\n   - \"Some rabbits [x]\": This translates to ExF(x).\n   - \"run faster than [H(x, y)]\": This denotes the relationship H(x, y) we want to symbolize for the relevant properties.\n   - \"all turtles [y]\": This translates to AyG(y).\n\n2.

We need to use the given predicates F(x) and G(x) to represent \"x is even\" and \"x is prime,\" respectively, in the domain of natural numbers (N).\n\n1. **2 is an even prime number.**\n\n   This means that G(2) and F(2) are both true.

For each formula, we will replace entity constants a with a′, function symbols with their implementation in 𝐽, and predicate symbols with their implementation in 𝐽.\n\n### For formula (1): ∀x∀y∃zF(f(x,y),z)\n\n1. Replace the function f with its implementation fJ, which is addition.\n2. Replace the predicate F with its implementation FJ, which denotes equality.\n3. Since the entities are natural numbers and no constant entities are directly involved in the formula, there's no replacement needed for any specific entities (such as a′ for a constant a).\n\nAfter applying these replacements, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[ ∀x∀y∃z F_J(f_J(x, y), z) \\]\n\nUsing the implementations specified:\n\n\\[ ∀x∀y∃z ((x + y) = z) \\]\n\nThis means for every x and y, there exists a z such that the sum of x and y is equal to z. Since the set of entities is the set of natural numbers \\( N \\), this is true by definition as the sum of any two natural numbers is always a natural number.\n\n### For formula (2): ∃x F(f(x,y),g(x,z))\n\n1. Replace the function f with its implementation fJ, which is addition.\n2. Replace the function g with its implementation gJ, which is multiplication.\n3.

Change the quality of the original proposition from affirmative to negative.\n2. Replace the predicate with its contrary (U to non-U).\nThis matches Method A's definition perfectly for a Universal Affirmative Proposition.\n\nThen, by applying the rules in Method A, we can derive \"All T is not non-U\", which can be reformulated to state the same proposition in terms of non-U as the subject and T as the object, matching our target statement if interpreted accordingly.\n\nHowever, the exact transformation directly from the original to the specific form of our target involves recognizing the contraries and repositioning, which aligns with the rules that Method A sets forth. Hence, the method that best describes the transformation from \"All T is U\" into a form that can be aligned to \"All non-U is not T\" through quality change and contrary predicate replacement, even if not directly describing repositioning, is Method A.\n\nTherefore, [[A]] is the answer indicating Method A was used."}

This is because the major premise involves P (the predicate of the conclusion) before M, the minor premise involves M before S, and the conclusion involves S before P. This order is consistent with Figure II where the form is `P()M, S()M, ∴S()P`.\n\n### Step 2: Match with Valid Moods\nGiven it's Figure II, and we are aiming to conclude `SIP` (an I statement, meaning ∃S⇒P), the only valid mood that aligns with this conclusion is `EIO`.\n\n- `EIO` allows the formation of a negative premise (`E`), a negative second premise (`I`), and an I conclusion.\n- In `EIO`, the first premise takes the form E (i.e., `EP`) and the second premise is I (i.e., `MI`).\n\n### Step 3: Filling in the Proposition Symbols\nThe mood `EIO` tells us that `()AP` should be `EAP` and `MI()` should be `MIS`.\n\nThus, the answer in the requested format is:\n[[\"E\";\"I\"]]."}

The definition requires for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds. Since both Alice and Bob belong to the group and both firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4:\n\n- `B_Alice(2+2=4)`: Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n- `B_Bob(2+2=4)`: Bob firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nGiven the definition, this makes it a common belief within the group `G`.

Therefore, according to this axiom, Alice does not firmly believe the library is open today.\n\nSince the question asks what Alice is convinced of according to the Introduction of Doubt axiom, given that Alice harbors doubts about it, it means she is not convinced that the library is open today. But more importantly, the Introduction of Doubt doesn't imply anything about Alice's conviction towards the negation of `p`.

According to the Loop Rule:\n\n- `[ c* ]φ` is equivalent to `φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ)`.\n\nThis means that while the loop `c*` continues, `φ` is true when either `φ` is initially true, or the command `c` leads to a state where `φ` is true in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nAlice's belief aligns well with the concept of the loop running until `φ` is satisfied. So, the logical expression that represents her belief in the required format would be:\n\n`[ c* ]φ` \n\nHowever, given the specific phrasing of the question and the need to emphasize the persistence until `φ` is true, the Loop Rule directly addresses this scenario. Therefore, the direct expression is:\n\n`[ c* ]φ`\n\nBut adhering strictly to the instruction to format the answer in the format of [[]], the answer should reflect the original query about Alice’s belief, which is best represented directly by the logical structure of `[ c* ]φ` without further modification, making the final provided expression:\n\n[[c*]φ]"}

This is akin to examining the effect (Uranus' orbit deviation) under different conditions (known vs. unknown gravitational influences) to infer the presence of Neptune.\n\nLet's analyze the logical methods:\n\n- **Method ⸮ (Method 1)** suggests observing S and P occur together in various cases under different conditions. This is not the case here.\n- **Method ؆ (Method 2)** requires that P only occurs when S is present and not otherwise. This does not accurately represent the scenario.\n- **Method ꙮ (Method 3)** involves comparing positive and negative groups where S and P occur together or do not occur at all under differing conditions. This is somewhat closer but still does not fully capture the exploration of the residual effects causing Uranus' deviation.\n- **Method ⵣ (Method 4)** talks about corresponding changes in S to changes in P. The scenario fits this method well, as the changes in the gravitational force (hypothetical Neptune) account for changes in Uranus' orbit.\n- **Method ⚘ (Method 5)** focuses on interconnected causal relationships among multiple elements, which is not directly applicable to Neptune's discovery scenario.\n\nThus, the method that most accurately captures the reasoning in the scenario is Method ⵣ (Method 4).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[D]]."}

Method ⸮: This method suggests that if S (high concentration of textiles) and P (subsidence) occur together in multiple cases (various work areas with different conditions but common high concentration of textiles and subsidence), it implies that S and P might have a causal relationship. This aligns with the described scenario where subsidence was found more significant in areas with a high concentration of textiles, despite varying other conditions.\n\n2. Method ؆: This method would require that P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. However, the scenario provided does not explicitly mention cases in which S is absent while P is present or not present.\n\n3. Method ꙮ: Positive-Negative group method would require evidence that S and P are absent together in some locations (negative group). The scenario given does not provide examples of such negative cases where the absence of textiles correlatively leads to the absence of subsidence.\n\n4. Method ⵣ: This method looks at cases where changes in S correspond to changes in P, potentially showing a direct relationship. The scenario does not directly describe such a relationship, but implies a correlation based on the presence of S (textiles, deep wells usage) being associated with P (groundwater withdrawal & subsidence).\n\n5. Method ⚘: This method involves complex causal network relationships beyond what is observed in the scenario, which directly ties the common factor to the main event of subsidence.\n\nSince the scenario described closely matches the logical explanation given in Method ⸮, where multiple instances of S (textiles, deep wells usage) and P (ground subsidence) occurring together help deduce a common cause, the most appropriate deduction method is:\n\n[[A]]"}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the logical method used in the given passage, let's analyze the information provided and match it against the defined methods for exploring causal relationships.\n\nThe passage mentions the correlation between the number of deep wells, the volume of underground water used, and the occurrence of ground subsidence. It refers to specific events and states of the situation:\n\n- Around 1860 to 1949, with 708 wells, there was 240,000 tonnes of water being drawn out per day, and the ground subsided by 35 millimetres.\n- By 1958-1960, the number of wells rose to 1,183 with 560,000 tonnes of water being drawn daily, and the subsidence increased to 98 millimetres annually.\n\nWhat we can extract from the text is that as the number of deep wells increased over time, more underground water was utilized, which corresponded with a greater rate of ground subsidence. This information suggests changes in one variable (S: number of deep wells and underground water usage) leading to corresponding changes in another variable (P: rate of ground subsidence).\n\nThis type of analysis is precisely what is suggested by Method ⵣ: when there's a clear pattern where changes in S lead to changes in P.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the derivation of cause and effect in this passage aligns with Method ⵣ.

The discovery hinges on the observation that the radioactivity remains high, leading to the inference of a new element.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option against the summarized information:\n\n- **Method ⸮:** This method looks for a causal relationship when S (the presence of uranium) and P (high radioactivity) occur together in multiple cases, even as other conditions vary. It does not exactly match the scenario, which shows P (high radioactivity) persisting even after S (uranium) is absent.\n  \n- **Method ؆:** This method suggests a causal relationship when P (high radioactivity) occurs with S (uranium present) and does not occur when S is absent. However, in this case, P (high radioactivity) remains despite the absence of S (uranium), which contradicts this method's logic.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This method requires both positive and negative groups. The positive group would be instances where S (uranium present) and P (high radioactivity) occur together, and the negative group would be instances where S is absent and P also does not occur. The scenario can be closely aligned with this method:\n    - Positive group (Presence of uranium with high radioactivity, e.g., uranium presence and observed radioactivity).\n    - Negative group (absence of uranium but still expecting high radioactivity, finding of new elements emitting radioactivity).\n\n- **Method ⵣ:** This method focuses on changes in S (uranium content) correlating directly with changes in P (radioactivity level or new elements). However, the passage does not illustrate a direct correlation but rather an unexplained higher radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This method refers to causal relationships involving multiple variables indirectly linked through other intermediate factors which does not apply to the straightforward scenario detailed.\n\nGiven the described conditions and analysis, **C. ꙮ method** best applies where presence/absence of uranium amidst overall radioactivity led to the discovery of new elements, closely aligning with both positive and negative group investigations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[C]]."}

The question infers that because Object B (the crow in University B) has the attributes (being a crow), it might also have the +Ψ attribute (having black feathers) like the crows in University A.\n\nFrom the given definitions of the reasoning methods:\n\n- The Ψ Method involves concluding that because Object B has certain attributes (a, b, c) like Object A, it also likely has the +Ψ attribute (d).\n- The ⌘ Method involves reasoning that if Object B does not have the same attributes (a, b, c) as Object A, it will not have the +⌘ attribute (d).\n\nThe question's reasoning fits the application of the Ψ Method, where observing that another crow (matching a, b, c) suggests the inference that it might also have the same attribute (black feathers, d).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[A]]."}

LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which paradox fits the scenario described, let's analyze the given information in the context of the provided definitions and rules.\n\n#### Given Information:\n- Holomorphic hypothesis ∀x(S(x) → W(x)), where S(x) means x is a swan and W(x) means x is white.\n- Seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) corroborates the hypothesis.\n- Seeing a white object that is not a swan (¬S(b) ∧ W(b)) also confirms it, according to the proposition ¬W(b) → ¬S(b).\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **GB Paradox**: This paradox involves using the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions with different inductive reasoning. The given scenario does not fit this as it does not involve contradictory conclusions based on an observation.\n   \n2. **BC Paradox**: This paradox deals with the confirmation of a universal hypothesis (∀x(R(x)→B(x))) through both its equivalence (¬B(x) → ¬R(x)) and the standard criteria (R(a)∧B(a)). In the provided scenario, the universal hypothesis is \"all swans are white,\" and it is confirmed both directly (by observing a white swan) and indirectly (through the inverse: a non-swan which is white). This matches the BC Paradox where direct and indirect confirmations are involved without a superficial contradiction.\n\n3. **LS Paradox**: This paradox is about the contradiction arising from multiple hypotheses that are reasonably believed but whose conjunction contradicts another hypothesis. The scenario does not fit this as there’s no indication of multiple conflicting hypotheses leading to a contradiction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the scenario closely matches the BC Paradox, as it involves confirming the universal hypothesis \"all swans are white\" both by direct and indirect methods.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The logical expression given is (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q).\n\nTo determine which paradox this expression represents, let's analyze it against the definitions provided for each paradox.\n\nThe GB Paradox involves the use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions using different inductive reasoning. However, the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) is stating that the hypothesis q follows regardless of whether p is true or not (or false). This falls more into confirming q universally irrespective of p's condition, which does not fit directly into the GB Paradox's pattern since there is no contradiction derived from different inductive processes about p.\n\nThe BC Paradox revolves around the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through different statements that are logically equivalent but intuitively may seem contradictory. Though the BC Paradox does touch on the confirmation of a hypothesis through different means, the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) suggests a straightforward confirmation of q regardless of the state of p, which feels more conclusive than paradoxical in this context. Hence, the BC Paradox also does not seem to be the best fit because the provided expression does not show a confusion over confirmation standards.\n\nThe LS Paradox deals with the situation where multiple reasonable hypotheses lead to a logical consequence that contradicts another reasonable hypothesis, triggering a reassessment of the hypotheses’ reasonableness. The expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) does not suggest a scenario where a number of hypotheses lead individually to a reasonable conclusion but whose conjunction results in a contradiction. This expression rather confirms that q is true regardless of the state of p, without presenting a contradiction among hypotheses.\n\nGiven the definitions and the provided expression, it appears that none of the paradoxes match exactly with the situation described in the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q). However, the closest fit appears to be **not any of the three** due to the lack of contradiction or reassessment requirement as detailed in the paradox definitions.\n\nSince the choices are limited to A/B/C and must choose based on the closest match to the definitions provided, the expression more closely aligns with the concept of confirming a hypothesis universally (q in this case) which, while significant, does not directly fit the paradox definition for contradiction among inductions or hypotheses. Thus, considering the options given and the nature of the provided logical expression, none is a perfect fit, but formulating an answer within constraints:\n\nThe closest logical assessment in provided options may be B, given the universal confirmation aspect:\n[[B]]"}

A universal hypothesis: ∀x(R(x) → B(x)).\n2. An equivalence condition: ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x) → ¬R(x)).\n3. Two ways to confirm the universal hypothesis:\n   - Through the condition R(a) ∧ B(a) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x)).\n   - Through the condition ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x)).\n\nThe key here is that ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) is directly mentioned as one of the ways to confirm the universal hypothesis according to the BC Paradox rule. Given this, we can conclude that the expression indeed aligns with the BC Paradox's mechanism.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[A]]"}

This goes beyond minimal communication, as it might imply a difficulty or effort involved in getting the tickets, which is not directly necessary to communicate just the fact that tickets were acquired.\n\nLet's evaluate against each principle:\n\n- **C* Principle**: Does not seem to fit directly as this principle focuses more on the strength of information relative to speaker knowledge and inferences regarding what the speaker can or cannot know.\n- **C% Principle**: Talks about speaking as little as possible and that a hearer would try to expand the information. C's statement does not adhere to speaking minimally as \"managed to get\" is more than necessary to convey the fact of purchasing tickets.\n- **C! Principle**: Addresses avoiding the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions unless they serve to convey a different meaning from what an unmarked expression would. C uses \"managed to get\" to imply the difficulty in obtaining tickets, which is a different, more detailed meaning indicating an effort, which is not the case with \"bought.\" This aligns with not using such expressions without reason, where here the reason is to convey additional meaning about the difficulty in acquiring tickets.\n\nGiven this analysis, the response aligns most closely with the C!

Furthermore, according to CQ1 under C* Principle, since \"<love, like>\" forms a hierarchy, with \"love\" being the stronger form of affection, and B chose to use \"like\" (the weaker form) despite being asked about \"love,\" it implies B knows that the stronger statement \"I love her\" cannot be established, adhering to the inference mechanism outlined in CQ1. \n\n2.

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given statement involves an observation about the contents of a food box, specifically that beer, which is found within the box, is warm. The key to understanding which principle this conforms to lies in examining how the statement aligns with the criteria described under each principle.\n\n- The **C* Principle** concerns the strength of the information conveyed by the speaker and the inferences a listener can make about the speaker's knowledge. There's no explicit indication here of weaker or stronger information being used by the speaker in reference to their knowledge or the hearer's inference about the speaker's knowledge of stronger information (CQ1 and CQ2). Therefore, this does not seem to be directly related to the C* Principle.\n\n- The **C! Principle** admonishes against the use of lengthy or marked expressions without reason, and suggests that if such expressions are used, they signify a twist or deviation from conventional understanding. The sentence about the beer being warm does not appear to use marked expressions or lengthy alternatives to convey its point; hence, it does not align well with the C! Principle either.\n\n- The **C% Principle** includes a Minimalization Criterion where the speaker is advised to speak only to the minimum extent necessary to convey the intended message. It also aligns the assumption of communication with the least amount of elaboration that is required to communicate the message clearly (CI1 and CI2). The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm → Beer is part of the food in the food box\" effectively captures a situation where the observation about beer relates directly to its presence and state within the food box, which supports the notion of communicating in the least elaborate way necessary to convey the presence of beer within the box.\n\n[[B]]"}

Instead, both responses highlight the progress on the project, indicating it is nearly finished. This behavior is somewhat akin to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" but there's a nuance in C's choice of words that is important.\n\n- C's wording (\"essentially wrapped up\") is purposefully selected. It conveys that while the project is very close to completion, it remains incomplete. This selective use of a marked expression, conveying a message that is slightly different from the direct unmarked statement (\"the project is finished\"), suggests that C is both providing reassurance and maintaining some ambiguity. This aligns most closely with the idea of avoiding conventional associations and expresses a nuanced meaning that could not be accomplished through simpler or more direct language.\n\nGiven the assessment above, the principle that best fits the nuanced and indirect communication exhibited by B and C, especially C's choice of expression, aligns most closely with the **C! Principle**. Hence:\n\n[[C]]"}

The problem at hand does not directly deal with the strength of information or the speaker's knowledge limitation concerning the strength of expressed information.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle speaks about minimalization, where the speaker communicates only the minimum necessary. The hearer expands the information to understand the full intention. Here, the statement is using the information mentioned minimally to imply further details (that a car that has a \"door\" issue must have doors). The hearer is reasoning beyond the literal statement to grasp the entire implication. This seems to fit our reasoning process, especially the hearer's expansion of information to fully understand the situation about the car having doors based on the door problem mentioned.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle involves using unmarked expression without resorting to longer or marked expressions without reason. This does not directly apply to the context provided since there's no indication of expression intricacy or attempts to avoid conventional associations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the reasoning conforms most closely to the **C% Principle (Hearer's CI1 and CI2)** where minimal information is used to convey necessary details, and the hearer expands on this to fully grasp the intended meaning.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

The generalization here does not necessarily involve the Information Principle, minimalization, or the use of unconventional expressions; it's a straightforward inference from the known fact that typically, a nurse can be a female.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. C* Principle - This principle deals with maintaining a certain strength of information in statements and what can be inferred about the speaker’s knowledge. The given statement only makes a generalization, not dealing with the strength of information or the knowledge of the speaker regarding the statement.\n\nB. C% Principle - This principle talks about minimalization, indicating that one should speak as little as necessary. While part of this principle relates to expanding information necessary for understanding, the general inference here doesn’t align directly with minimalization but rather a common sense inference about the characteristics of the individual involved.\n\nC. C! Principle - This principle addresses avoiding lengthy or marked expressions that do not have a reason for being used. The statement “Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female” is not a lengthy or marked expression but a simple generalization from a specific example to a more general form. Therefore, this principle does not seem directly applicable.\n\nGiven these insights, none of the principles described strictly conform to the logical reasoning used in the inferred statement. However, the statement is primarily a form of generalization which somewhat aligns with the notion of speaking as minimally as necessary (to say someone gives flowers to a female when the context specifies a nurse), when viewed through the lens of C% Principle. \n\nTherefore, the closest fit for the given statement among the choices is:\n\n[[B]]"}

The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The definition provided for \"Internet\" explains the origin and evolution of the term by mentioning that it is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet,\" detailing what each part of the term signifies. This approach to definition is characteristic of the ℓ Definition, which explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nIf Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast, then he will spend a long time online. Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
