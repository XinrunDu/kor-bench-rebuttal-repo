Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"B\" according to the given rules, we need to follow the encryption steps precisely. Here’s the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the Block and Grid:**\n   - The plaintext \"B\" is a single character, so it forms a block of 5 characters by itself (padded with the remaining characters).\n   - Since it is the 0th block, we calculate the grid index using `grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8`, which gives us `grid_index = 0`. So, we use Grid0.\n\n2. **Grid0:**\n   - Grid0 is:\n     ```\n     | P | H | I | L | S |\n     | A | B | C | D | E |\n     | F | G | K | M | N |\n     | O | Q | R | T | U |\n     | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n     ```\n\n3. **Find the Position of 'B':**\n   - 'B' is located at position (1, 1) in Grid0.\n\n4. **Move One Grid Position to the Lower Right:**\n   - Moving one position to the lower right from (1, 1) results in (2, 2).\n   - The letter at position (2, 2) in Grid0 is 'K'.\n\n5. **Form the Encrypted Block:**\n   - The encrypted block for \"B\" is \"K\".\n\n6. **Final Encrypted Message:**\n   - Since \"B\" is the only character in the block, the final encrypted message is \"K\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer is:\n\n[[K]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"V\" using the specified rules, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters:**\n   - Since the plaintext \"V\" is only one character, it will form a block of one character: \"V\".\n\n2. **Determine the grid used for the current block:**\n   - The block number is 0 (since it's the first block).\n   - Calculate the grid index: \\( \\text{grid\\_index} = (0 // 5) \\% 8 = 0 \\).\n   - So, we use Grid0.\n\n3. **Find the position of the character in the current grid:**\n   - In Grid0, the character \"V\" is located at position (4, 0).\n\n4. **Move one grid position to the lower right:**\n   - Starting from (4, 0), moving one position to the lower right would be (5, 1).\n   - Since the grid is 5x5, moving beyond the boundary means wrapping around. So (5, 1) wraps to (0, 1).\n\n5. **Get the letter at the position after the move:**\n   - In Grid0, the letter at position (0, 1) is \"H\".\n\n6. **Form the final encrypted block:**\n   - The encrypted block is \"H\".\n\n7. **Form the final encrypted message:**\n   - Since there is only one block, the final encrypted message is \"H\".\n\nThus, the encrypted answer is:\n\n[[H]]"}

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\"\nperiod: 8\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PBXSYAFH\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

We need to pad it to 16 characters. We will use '#' as the filler character.\n   - Padded plaintext: \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU##\"\n\n3. **Encryption Steps:**\n   - Place the template on the grid and fill the holes with the first four letters of the plaintext: \"Z\", \"W\", \"O\", \"U\".\n     ```\n     [[, , , ]\n     [, , Z, W]\n     [, , , O]\n     [U, , , ]]\n     ```\n   - Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise and fill the next four letters: \"B\", \"D\", \"S\", \"P\".\n     ```\n     [[, , B, ]\n     [, , , D]\n     [[, , , ]\n     [, , S, P]]\n     ```\n   - Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise and fill the next four letters: \"F\", \"O\", \"X\", \"U\".\n     ```\n     [[F, , , ]\n     [, O, , ]\n     [, , X, ]\n     [, U, , ]]\n     ```\n   - Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise and fill the last four letters: \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\".\n     ```\n     [[, #, #, ]\n     [, , , #]\n     [, #, , ]\n     [#, , , ]]\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - After filling the grid, it looks like:\n     ```\n     [[L, H, E, O],\n     [W, L, L, O],\n     [O, R, D, V],\n     [E, #, #, L]]\n     ```\n   - However, with the correct plaintext and template application:\n     ```\n     [[Z, W, O, U],\n     [B, D, S, P],\n     [F, O, X, U],\n     [#, #, #, #]]\n     ```\n\n5. **Reading the Ciphertext:**\n   - Read the grid line by line to get the ciphertext.\n   - Ciphertext: \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU##\"\n\nSince the plaintext was exactly 12 characters, and we padded it to 16 characters, the final ciphertext is:\n\n[[ZWOUBDSPFOXU##]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Let's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Padding\n- The plaintext is \"S\".\n- \"S\" is a single byte, so we need to pad it to make it 8 bytes long.\n- After padding, the block becomes: \"S\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n### Step 2: Block Splitting\n- The padded block is already 8 bytes long, so we don't need to split it further.\n- The block to encrypt is: \"S\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n### Step 3: Block Encryption\n1. **Convert Block to Bytes:**\n   - Convert the block \"S\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n   - \"S\" = 0x53, so the bytes are: [0x53, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\n2. **XOR with Key:**\n   - Key: b'1234567890ABCDEF' = [0x31, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38]\n   - XOR result: [0x53 ^ 0x31, 0x00 ^ 0x32, 0x00 ^ 0x33, 0x00 ^ 0x34, 0x00 ^ 0x35, 0x00 ^ 0x36, 0x00 ^ 0x37, 0x00 ^ 0x38] = [0x62, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38]\n\n3. **Substitute:**\n   - Use the S_BOX to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte.\n   - 0x62 => 0x6 (high) and 0x2 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x6] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x2] = 0x07 => 0x0D07\n   - 0x32 => 0x3 (high) and 0x2 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x2] = 0x07 => 0x0507\n   - 0x33 => 0x3 (high) and 0x3 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05 => 0x0505\n   - 0x34 => 0x3 (high) and 0x4 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x4] = 0x09 => 0x0509\n   - 0x35 => 0x3 (high) and 0x5 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x5] = 0x03 => 0x0503\n   - 0x36 => 0x3 (high) and 0x6 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x6] = 0x0D => 0x050D\n   - 0x37 => 0x3 (high) and 0x7 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x7] = 0x00 => 0x0500\n   - 0x38 => 0x3 (high) and 0x8 (low)\n     - S_BOX[0x3] = 0x05, S_BOX[0x8] = 0x0E => 0x050E\n   - Result: [0x0D07, 0x0507, 0x0505, 0x0509, 0x0503, 0x050D, 0x0500, 0x050E]\n\n4. **Permute:**\n   - Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n   - 0x0D07 => 0x1A0E\n   - 0x0507 => 0x0A0F\n   - 0x0505 => 0x0A0A\n   - 0x0509 => 0x0A02\n   - 0x0503 => 0x0A06\n   - 0x050D => 0x0A0B\n   - 0x0500 => 0x0A00\n   - 0x050E => 0x0A0C\n   - Result: [0x1A0E, 0x0A0F, 0x0A0A, 0x0A02, 0x0A06, 0x0A0B, 0x0A00, 0x0A0C]\n\n5. **XOR with Key:**\n   - XOR result: [0x1A0E ^ 0x31, 0x0A0F ^ 0x32, 0x0A0A ^ 0x33, 0x0A02 ^ 0x34, 0x0A06 ^ 0x35, 0x0A0B ^ 0x36, 0x0A00 ^ 0x37, 0x0A0C ^ 0x38]\n   - Result: [0x2B3F, 0x382D, 0x393A, 0x3E36, 0x3F33, 0x3C3D, 0x3D37, 0x3C3E]\n\n6. **Hexadecimal Encoding:**\n   - Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n   - Result: \"2B3F382D393A3E363F333C3D3D373C3E\"\n\n### Final Encrypted Answer:\n[[2B3F382D393A3E363F333C3D3D373C3E]]"}

Let's break it down:\n\n### Modular Exponentiation:\n\\[ 54^{263} \\mod 299 \\]\n\nWe can use the method of exponentiation by squaring to efficiently compute this:\n\n1. **Binary representation of 263:**\n   - \\( 263 = 100000111_2 \\)\n\n2. **Initialize variables:**\n   - \\( result = 1 \\)\n   - \\( base = 54 \\)\n   - \\( exponent = 263 \\)\n\n3. **Exponentiation by squaring:**\n   - For each bit in the binary representation of the exponent:\n     - Square the base and take the result modulo 299.\n     - If the current bit is 1, multiply the result by the base and take the result modulo 299.\n\nLet's perform the calculations step by step:\n\n- \\( 54^1 \\mod 299 = 54 \\)\n- \\( 54^2 \\mod 299 = 2916 \\mod 299 = 214 \\)\n- \\( 54^4 \\mod 299 = 214^2 \\mod 299 = 45796 \\mod 299 = 265 \\)\n- \\( 54^8 \\mod 299 = 265^2 \\mod 299 = 70225 \\mod 299 = 182 \\)\n- \\( 54^{16} \\mod 299 = 182^2 \\mod 299 = 33124 \\mod 299 = 135 \\)\n- \\( 54^{32} \\mod 299 = 135^2 \\mod 299 = 18225 \\mod 299 = 182 \\)\n- \\( 54^{64} \\mod 299 = 182^2 \\mod 299 = 33124 \\mod 299 = 135 \\)\n- \\( 54^{128} \\mod 299 = 135^2 \\mod 299 = 18225 \\mod 299 = 182 \\)\n- \\( 54^{256} \\mod 299 = 182^2 \\mod 299 = 33124 \\mod 299 = 135 \\)\n\nNow, combine the results for the bits that are 1 in the binary representation of 263 (1, 4, 8, 128):\n\n- \\( 54^{263} = 54^{256} \\times 54^8 \\times 54^4 \\times 54^1 \\mod 299 \\)\n- \\( 54^{263} = 135 \\times 182 \\times 265 \\times 54 \\mod 299 \\)\n\nLet's compute this step by step:\n\n- \\( 135 \\times 182 = 24570 \\)\n- \\( 24570 \\mod 299 = 104 \\)\n- \\( 104 \\times 265 = 27560 \\)\n- \\( 27560 \\mod 299 = 154 \\)\n- \\( 154 \\times 54 = 8316 \\)\n- \\( 8316 \\mod 299 = 80 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 54^{263} \\mod 299 = 80 \\).\n\n4. **Convert the decimal number to a character:**\n   - The ASCII code 80 corresponds to the letter 'P'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [[P]]"}
