Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if \\((p > q) > r\\) and \\(p > (q > r)\\) are equivalent, we need to convert both expressions to a form that uses only `|`, `&`, and `!` and then compare them.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \\((p > q) > r\\)\n\n1. \\(p > q\\) can be rewritten using the equivalence \\(p > q ::=:: !p | q\\).\n2. So, \\((p > q) > r\\) becomes \\((!p | q) > r\\).\n3. Using the equivalence \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\), we get \\((!p | q) > r ::=:: !(!p | q) | r\\).\n4. Using De Morgan's law \\(!(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B\\), we get \\(!(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q\\).\n5. Therefore, \\((!p | q) > r ::=:: (p & !q) | r\\).\n\nSo, \\((p > q) > r\\) is \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\n### Step 2: Convert \\(p > (q > r)\\)\n\n1. \\(q > r\\) can be rewritten using the equivalence \\(q > r ::=:: !q | r\\).\n2. So, \\(p > (q > r)\\) becomes \\(p > (!q | r)\\).\n3. Using the equivalence \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\), we get \\(p > (!q | r) ::=:: !p | (!q | r)\\).\n4. Using the associative property of OR, we get \\(!p | (!q | r) ::=:: (!p | !q) | r\\).\n\nSo, \\(p > (q > r)\\) is \\((!p | !q) | r\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compare the two expressions\n\n- \\((p > q) > r\\) is \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n- \\(p > (q > r)\\) is \\((!p | !q) | r\\).\n\nClearly, \\((p & !q) | r\\) and \\((!p | !q) | r\\) are not the same expressions. Therefore, \\((p > q) > r\\) and \\(p > (q > r)\\) are not equivalent.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[B]]"}

Use equivalence (9) again to simplify `0 & !q`:\n   \\[\n   0 & !q ::=:: 0\n   \\]\n   So the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   0 & r\n   \\]\n7.

For 4 propositional variables, \\( m_0 \\) corresponds to the true assignment where all variables are false, i.e., 0000, which is the binary representation of 0. Therefore, \\( m_0 \\) is the term \\( \\neg p \\land \\neg q \\land \\neg r \\land \\neg s \\).\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the All-Even Form\nA formula is an all-even form if all the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form are even. The indices \\( i \\) range from 0 to 15 (since there are 4 variables, \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) possible assignments).\n\nThe even indices in this range are:\n\\[ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combining the Conditions\nTo be both a basic form and an all-even form, the formula must include \\( m_0 \\) and can only include other paired conjunctive terms with even indices.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Possible Formulas\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose a subset of the even indices that includes \\( m_0 \\). The even indices available are:\n\\[ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 \\]\n\nSince \\( m_0 \\) must be included, we are left to choose a subset from the remaining 7 even indices. The number of ways to choose a subset from 7 elements is given by \\( 2^7 \\).\n\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form is:\n\n\\[[128]\\]"}

Yes \nB.No\nAnswer format: [[option]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if the clauses C1 = p ∨ q and C2 = p ∨ r can be resolved, we need to check if they contain complementary literals. According to the resolution rule, two clauses C1 and C2 can be resolved if C1 = C3 ∨ L and C2 = C4 ∨ L', where L and L' are complementary literals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify the literals in each clause:**\n   - C1 = p ∨ q\n   - C2 = p ∨ r\n\n2. **Check for complementary literals:**\n   - In C1, the literals are p and q.\n   - In C2, the literals are p and r.\n   - Neither q nor r are complementary to p, and there are no other literals that appear in both clauses with their complements.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no complementary literals between C1 and C2, they cannot be resolved.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[B]]"}

The given form is:\n\nMIP\nM()S\n∴S()P\n\nThis matches the form of Figure III:\n\nM()P\nM()S\n∴S()P\n\nNow, we need to identify which of the valid moods for Figure III can be used. The valid moods for Figure III are:\n- AII\n- EIO\n- IAI\n- OAO\n\nGiven that the first premise is \"MIP\" (which translates to \"I\" in the syllogistic form), we can use the following moods:\n- AII\n- IAI\n\nLet's analyze each mood:\n\n1. **AII**:\n   - First premise: M()P (I)\n   - Second premise: M()S (I)\n   - Conclusion: S()P (I)\n\n2. **IAI**:\n   - First premise: M()P (I)\n   - Second premise: M()S (I)\n   - Conclusion: S()P (I)\n\nBoth moods fit the given form and the valid moods for Figure III. However, the given first premise is \"MIP\" (I), and the second premise must also be \"I\" to match the valid moods.\n\nThus, the correct mood is **AII** or **IAI**. Since both fit, we can choose either one. For this solution, we will use **AII**:\n\n- First premise: MIP (I)\n- Second premise: MIS (I)\n- Conclusion: SIP (I)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[I; I]; [I]]\n\nThis means:\n- The first premise is \"MIP\" (I)\n- The second premise is \"MIS\" (I)\n- The conclusion is \"SIP\" (I)"}

In modal logic, this can be expressed as the necessity of science not being a one-man endeavour.\n\n3. **Formulate the Modal Proposition**:\n   - The statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" can be translated to \"It is necessary that science is not a one-man endeavour.\"\n   - Using the symbol # for necessity, we can write this as #¬q, where q denotes \"Science is a one-man endeavour.\"\n\n4. **Relate to the Given Proposition**:\n   - We need to express \"Science is a one-man endeavour\" in terms of p. Since p is \"Science is a human endeavour,\" we can infer that if science is a human endeavour, it involves more than one person. However, for simplicity, we can directly use q to represent \"Science is a one-man endeavour.\"\n\n5. **Final Symbolization**:\n   - The statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" is symbolized as #¬q.\n\nSince q is not given directly in terms of p, we need to express it in a way that it aligns with the given modal logic rules. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we can assume q is a separate proposition. If we need to express it in terms of p, we might need to create a logical implication or equivalence, but for simplicity, we will use q directly.\n\nThus, the final symbolization is:\n\n\\[ [\\#¬q] \\]\n\nHowever, if we need to express it directly in terms of p, we can consider the following:\n\n- If p is \"Science is a human endeavour,\" then the negation of \"Science is a one-man endeavour\" can be directly related to p. Thus, we can say:\n\n\\[ [\\#¬(p \\& \\text{\"one person\"})] \\]\n\nBut for simplicity and adherence to the given rules, we will use:\n\n\\[ [\\#¬q] \\]\n\nThis symbolizes the statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" using the given modal logic notation."}

This does not fit the Neptune discovery, as it was a single, specific hypothesis based on a deviation, not a pattern observed across multiple cases.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method observes P when S is present and absent. The Neptune scenario does not involve observing Uranus's orbit in the presence and absence of Neptune; instead, it involves a prediction based on a hypothesis.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This method involves a positive group where S and P co-occur and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. Again, this does not fit the Neptune scenario, as it is not about comparing groups but about a single hypothesis and its verification.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This method involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. This fits the Neptune scenario, as the presence of Neptune (S) corresponds to the observed deviation in Uranus's orbit (P).\n\n- **Method ⚘**: This method involves known causal relationships between multiple factors leading to the conclusion of a causal relationship between S and P. This method does not fit the Neptune scenario, as it was a direct hypothesis and verification, not a network of known causal relationships.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe discovery of Neptune is best described by **Method ⵣ**, where the changes in the presence of an unknown object (Neptune) correspond to the observed changes in Uranus's orbit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[D]]."}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the method used in the given passage, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant properties and objects:**\n   - **S (Suspected Cause):** The number of deep wells and the amount of underground water used.\n   - **P (Effect):** The rate of ground subsidence in Shanghai.\n\n2. **Examine the historical and current data:**\n   - **1860s:** First wells were dug.\n   - **1949:** 708 deep wells, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, ground subsidence by 35 millimetres.\n   - **1958-1960:** 1,183 deep wells, producing 560,000 tonnes of water per day, ground subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.\n\n3. **Analyze the data in the context of the given methods:**\n\n   - **Method ⸮ (Common Ground):**\n     - This method looks for common conditions (S) that occur together with the effect (P) across different cases, while other conditions differ.\n     - The passage shows that as the number of deep wells increased and the amount of water used also increased, the rate of ground subsidence also increased.

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which paradox the given logical expression represents, let's break down the expression and compare it to the definitions and rules of each paradox.\n\n### Logical Expression:\n- p: an event\n- q: a hypothesis\n- Expression: (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q)\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **GB Paradox (Grue-Bleen Paradox)**:\n   - Premise: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n   - If hypothesis q_1 is assumed, then p.\n   - If hypothesis q_2 is assumed, then p.\n   - Since q_1 and q_2 are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n   - Conclusion: It is not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct.\n\n   The GB Paradox involves two contradictory hypotheses (q_1 and q_2) both leading to the same observation p. However, in the given expression, there is only one hypothesis q, and it is derived from both p and ¬p. This does not fit the structure of the GB Paradox, which requires two contradictory hypotheses.\n\n2. **BC Paradox (Raven Paradox or Hempel's Paradox)**:\n   - Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n   - According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n   - According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n   - According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n   - Conclusion: Care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n   The BC Paradox deals with the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalent conditions and specific instances. The given expression does not involve universal quantifiers or specific instances, so it does not match the structure of the BC Paradox.\n\n3. **LS Paradox (Lottery Paradox)**:\n   - Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n   - The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n   - If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n   - Conclusion: A balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n   The LS Paradox involves a set of reasonable hypotheses whose conjunction leads to a contradiction with another reasonable hypothesis. The given expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) does not involve a set of multiple hypotheses or a contradiction with another hypothesis, so it does not fit the structure of the LS Paradox.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe given expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) does not fit the structure of any of the three paradoxes directly. However, it can be seen as a form of a logical tautology where q is always true regardless of p. This does not align with the specific paradoxes described.\n\nSince the expression does not fit the GB, BC, or LS paradoxes, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A/B/C]] [[None]]\n\nHowever, if we must choose one of the given options, the closest match in terms of structure (though not exact) is the GB Paradox, as it involves the same outcome (p) from different conditions (q_1 and q_2), even though the given expression does not involve contradictory hypotheses.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n[[A]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. GB Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n- If hypothesis q_1 is assumed, then p.\n- If hypothesis q_2 is assumed, then p.\n- Since q_1 and q_2 are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, it is not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- p\n- q_1 → p\n- q_2 → p\n- q_1 ∧ q_2 → ⊥\n\n2. BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- R(a)∧B(a)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))≡∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))\n- ¬B(b)∧¬R(b)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if the given logical expression represents the LS Paradox, we need to follow the rules of the LS Paradox step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Hypotheses:**\n   - \\( r_1 \\): Assumption 1\n   - \\( r_2 \\): Assumption 2\n\n2. **Form the Conjunction of Hypotheses:**\n   - \\( r_1 \\wedge r_2 \\)\n\n3. **Check the Logical Consequence:**\n   - The given expression is \\( (r_1 \\wedge r_2) \\rightarrow \\bot \\)\n   - This means that if \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are both true, then a contradiction (\\( \\bot \\)) is derived.\n\n4. **Apply the LS Paradox Rules:**\n   - According to the LS Paradox, if the conjunction of the hypotheses \\( r_1 \\wedge r_2 \\) leads to a contradiction (\\( \\bot \\)), then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n   - The given expression \\( (r_1 \\wedge r_2) \\rightarrow \\bot \\) directly states that the conjunction of \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) results in a contradiction.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The expression \\( (r_1 \\wedge r_2) \\rightarrow \\bot \\) matches the form \\( r_1 \\wedge r_2 \\wedge r_{n+1} \\rightarrow \\bot \\) where \\( r_{n+1} \\) is implicitly the conjunction of \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\).\n   - Therefore, this expression represents a situation where the conjunction of the hypotheses leads to a contradiction, which is a key characteristic of the LS Paradox.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A]]"}

However, \"bought\" is a stronger and more direct statement. According to C* Principle, this would suggest that C knows that the stronger statement (bought) cannot be established, which doesn't seem to fit the context.\n\n2. **C% Principle:**\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n   - **Hearer's Inference:**\n     - **CI1:** Assume the relationship between objects and time follows convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n     - **CI2:** If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying.\n\n   - C's statement \"I managed to get two tickets\" is more elaborate than simply saying \"I bought two tickets.\" This does not align with the minimalization criterion of C% Principle, as C is providing more information than necessary.\n\n3. **C! Principle:**\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n   - **Hearer's Inference:** If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n   - C's use of \"managed to get\" instead of \"bought\" is a marked expression. This implies that getting the tickets was not easy and took some effort. According to C! Principle, the marked expression indicates that C's meaning is different from the unmarked expression, specifically highlighting the effort involved.\n\n### Conclusion:\nC's statement \"I managed to get two tickets\" aligns with the C! Principle because it uses a marked expression to convey additional information about the effort involved in obtaining the tickets.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[C]]"}

I need a definite answer.\"\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** A is requesting a clear and direct response about the project's completion on time. This aligns with the C% Principle (Minimalization Criterion) because A is asking for the minimum necessary information to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n2. **B's Response:**\n   - \"We have finished most of the work, with only a few details left to address.\"\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** B provides information about the progress but does not give a definite answer to A's question. This does not align with the C% Principle (Minimalization Criterion) because B is not providing the minimal information required to directly answer A's question.\n   - **Hearer's Inference (C% Principle):** A might infer that B is not confident enough to give a definite answer, or there might be some uncertainty about the remaining work.\n   - **Hearer's Inference (C* Principle):** B's statement is weak in information (w) compared to a stronger statement that the project will be completed on time (s). According to CQ1, A can infer that B knows that the stronger statement (project will be completed on time) cannot be established with certainty.\n\n3. **C's Response:**\n   - \"We have essentially wrapped up the project, with just some minor finishing touches remaining.\"\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** C uses a more marked and optimistic expression (\"essentially wrapped up\") compared to B. This aligns with the C! Principle because C is using a longer and more euphemistic expression to convey a similar message.\n   - **Hearer's Inference (C! Principle):** The use of \"essentially wrapped up\" suggests that C is trying to convey a high likelihood of project success while also leaving some room for unforeseen work. This implies that C is using a marked expression to avoid the conventional association of \"not completed\" that might come with B's response.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **B's response** aligns more closely with the C* Principle because it provides a weaker statement, and the hearer (A) can infer that the stronger statement (project will be completed on time) cannot be established with certainty.\n- **C's response** aligns more closely with the C! Principle because C uses a marked expression to convey a more positive but still cautious message.\n\nGiven the context and the dialogue, the most fitting principle is the C! Principle, as C's response uses a marked expression that suggests a high likelihood of project success while leaving some room for uncertainty.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[C]]"}

This is a direct and strong inference from the given information. However, the speaker does not need to provide any additional information to make this inference, which aligns more with the C% Principle.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**:\n     - **CI1**: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n     - **CI2**: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying.

This aligns well with the C% Principle.\n\n3. **C!

The language used is straightforward and conventional, so it does not align with the C!

The speaker is not providing weaker information than what their knowledge allows.\n- **Hearer's Inference:**\n  - **CQ1:** The statement \"the door won't close\" is a weaker form of information compared to \"the car has doors\" (since a car having doors is more general and less specific). However, the fact that the door won't close is a stronger piece of information because it implies the car has doors.\n  - **CQ2:** The statement \"the door won't close\" does not entail any specific information about the car having doors, but the stronger information (the car having doors) is entailed. However, this principle is more about the speaker not knowing something, which is not applicable here.\n\n### C% Principle:\n- **Speaker's Criterion:** The statement is minimal and directly conveys the issue with the car's door. It does not provide unnecessary information.\n- **Hearer's Inference:**\n  - **CI1:** The relationship between the objects (the car and its door) and the time (the present condition of the door not closing) is straightforward and follows the conventional understanding.\n  - **CI2:** The statement directly matches the confirmed situation that the car has a door that won't close, which implies the car has doors.\n\n### C! Principle:\n- **Speaker's Criterion:** The statement is straightforward and uses simple, unmarked expressions. There is no use of lengthy or obscure expressions.\n- **Hearer's Inference:** The speaker is using a direct and conventional way to express the issue, which aligns with the principle of avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close → Zhang San's new car has doors\" primarily aligns with the **C% Principle** because it follows the minimalization criterion and the hearer can expand the information to infer that the car has doors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

According to CQ1, if the speaker says the weaker statement (female), it can be inferred that the speaker knows that the stronger statement (nurse) cannot be established.

This does not apply here because neither B nor C is using a weaker statement to avoid a stronger one.\n   - **CQ2**: This principle involves the inference that if a speaker uses a weaker statement that does not entail a specific piece of information, it can be inferred that the speaker does not know that information. This also does not apply here because C's statement \"I managed to get the materials\" does not avoid entailing any specific information but rather adds a nuance.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - **CI1**: This principle involves the assumption of conventional relationships between objects and time unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.

B's response \"I borrowed the materials\" is direct and matches the situation. However, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" adds a nuance suggesting that the process was not straightforward, which goes beyond the minimal necessary communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: The principle states that the speaker should not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. C's use of \"I managed to get the materials\" is a marked expression compared to the direct \"I borrowed the materials.\" This marked expression implies that the process was more challenging or involved additional effort.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The hearer can infer that C's use of \"managed\" means that the process was not simple, and C encountered some difficulties. This aligns with the C!

The passage uses specific stories (Sun Wukong and the Guizhou Donkey) to support the idea that smaller, more agile forces can defeat larger ones.\n   - **Syl+ Method:** This method uses universal propositions as premises to support conclusions through syllogistic reasoning. The passage does not present a syllogism or a universal proposition.\n   - **Metaph+ Method:** This method uses metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic. The passage uses the stories as metaphors to illustrate the strategy of dealing with a powerful enemy.\n   - **Case+ Method:** This method involves proving the truthfulness of a proposition by discussing each case separately. The passage does discuss two specific cases (Sun Wukong and the Guizhou Donkey) to support the main point.\n   - **Contra- Method:** This method indirectly confirms the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition. The passage does not refute any contrary proposition.\n   - **Elim- Method:** This method indirectly determines the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities as false. The passage does not eliminate other possibilities.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The passage primarily uses specific instances (Sun Wukong and the Guizhou Donkey) to argue for the effectiveness of a strategy. This aligns with the **E+ Method**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[A]]"}

This method is employed when it is necessary to prove that a proposition holds true under various conditions, and this is done by discussing each case separately. In the given problem, the proposition is that any integer \\( n \\) can be classified as either even or odd. This is achieved by considering two separate cases:\n\n1. **Case 1**: \\( n \\) is even, where \\( n = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n2. **Case 2**: \\( n \\) is odd, where \\( n = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nBy proving the truth of the proposition under each of these cases, the argument demonstrates that any integer \\( n \\) must fall into one of these two categories.
