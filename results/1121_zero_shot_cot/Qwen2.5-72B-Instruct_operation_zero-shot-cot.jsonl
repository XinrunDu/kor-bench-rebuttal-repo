However, for the sake of the problem, we should consider the integer part, which is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \\(4※(X※13)\\)\n\nWe now have the expression \\(4※(X※13) = 3\\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate \\(X※13\\)\n\nWe need to determine \\(X※13\\) such that when it is operated with 4, the result is 3. Let's denote \\(X※13\\) as \\(Y\\). So, we have:\n\n- \\(4※Y = 3\\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine \\(Y\\) based on the operation rule\n\nLet's consider the possible cases for \\(4※Y = 3\\):\n\n1. **If \\(4\\) is a multiple of \\(Y\\):**\n   - \\(4※Y = Y/4 + 2 = 3\\)\n   - \\(Y/4 = 1\\)\n   - \\(Y = 4\\)\n\n2. **If \\(Y\\) is a multiple of \\(4\\):**\n   - \\(4※Y = 4/Y + 2 = 3\\)\n   - \\(4/Y = 1\\)\n   - \\(Y = 4\\)\n\n3. **If neither is a multiple of the other:**\n   - \\(4※Y = 24\\), which is not equal to 3, so this case is not possible.\n\nSo, \\(Y = 4\\).\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\(X\\) in \\(X※13 = 4\\)\n\nNow we need to find \\(X\\) such that \\(X※13 = 4\\).\n\n1. **If \\(X\\) is a multiple of \\(13\\):**\n   - \\(X※13 = 13/X + 2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(13/X = 2\\)\n   - \\(X = 13/2\\), which is not an integer, so this case is not possible.\n\n2. **If \\(13\\) is a multiple of \\(X\\):**\n   - \\(X※13 = X/13 + 2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(X/13 = 2\\)\n   - \\(X = 26\\)\n\n3. **If neither is a multiple of the other:**\n   - \\(X※13 = 24\\), which is not equal to 4, so this case is not possible.\n\nSo, the only possible value for \\(X\\) is 26.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{26}\\]\n\nEnclosed as requested:\n\n[[26]]"}

The operation a#b is defined as the average of all even numbers between a and b, including a and b.\n\nGiven:\n3#X = 4\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Even Numbers Between 3 and X:**\n   - We need to find the even numbers between 3 and X (inclusive).\n   - The smallest even number greater than or equal to 3 is 4.\n\n2. **Determine the Average of Even Numbers:**\n   - Let's denote the even numbers between 3 and X as \\(4, 6, 8, \\ldots, X\\).\n   - The average of these even numbers is given as 4.\n\n3. **Formulate the Average Equation:**\n   - If \\(4, 6, 8, \\ldots, 2k\\) are the even numbers between 3 and X, then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{4 + 6 + 8 + \\ldots + 2k}{n}\n     \\]\n     where \\(n\\) is the number of even numbers in the sequence.\n\n4. **Simplify the Sum of Even Numbers:**\n   - The sum of the first \\(n\\) even numbers is given by:\n     \\[\n     4 + 6 + 8 + \\ldots + 2k = 2(2 + 3 + 4 + \\ldots + k) = 2 \\left(\\frac{(k-1)(k+2)}{2}\\right) = (k-1)(k+2)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The average of these even numbers is 4:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(k-1)(k+2)}{k} = 4\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by \\(k\\):\n     \\[\n     (k-1)(k+2) = 4k\n     \\]\n     - Expand and simplify:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + 2k - k - 2 = 4k\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     k^2 + k - 2 = 4k\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     k^2 - 3k - 2 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Solve the quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Determine the Valid \\(k\\):**\n   - Since \\(k\\) must be a positive integer, we check the possible values:\n     - \\(k = 2\\) or \\(k = 4\\)\n\n8. **Find the Corresponding X:**\n   - If \\(k = 2\\), the even numbers are 4, 6.
