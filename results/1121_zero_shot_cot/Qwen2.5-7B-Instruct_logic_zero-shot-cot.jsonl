Apply equivalence (10): `A > B ::= :: !A | B`\n   - `p > (p | q) ::= :: !p | (p | q)`\n   \n2. Simplify the expression using equivalence (3): `A | B ::= :: B | A`\n   - `!p | (p | q) ::= :: (p | q) | !p`\n   \n3. Recognize that `!(A | B) ::= :: !A & !B`\n   - `!(p | q) | !p ::= :: (!p & !(p | q))`\n   \n4. Substitute back into the original expression:\n   - `!(p > (p | q)) & r ::= !( (p | q) | !p ) & r ::= (!p & !(p | q)) & r`\n   \n5. Recall from equivalence (13): `!A = !B ::=:: A = B`\n   - `!p & !(p | q) ::= (p = (p | q))`\n   \n6. Simplify further:\n   - `!(p | q) ::= p & !q`\n   - `!p & (p & !q) ::= :: 0`\n   - Therefore:\n   - `!p & !(p | q) ::= 0`\n   \n7. Hence, the final expression is:\n   - `0 & r ::= 0`\n   \nSo, the simplest result for Expression 1 is `0`.\n\n### Expression 2: `p & (((p | q) & !p) > q)`\n\n1. Apply equivalence (10): `A > B ::= :: !A | B`\n   - `((p | q) & !p) > q ::= !((p | q) & !p) | q`\n   \n2. Apply equivalence (6): `!(A & B) ::= :: !A | !B`\n   - `!((p | q) & !p) ::= !!(p | q) | !!!p ::= (p | q) | p`\n   \n3. Simplify `(p | q) | p` using equivalence (3): `A | A ::=:: 1`\n   - `!((p | q) & !p) ::= 1`\n   \n4. Substitute back into the original expression:\n   - `p & (((p | q) & !p) > q) ::= p & (1 | q)`\n   \n5. Simplify `1 | q`:\n   - `1 | q ::= 1`\n   \n6. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n   - `p & 1 ::= p`\n   \nSo, the simplest result for Expression 2 is `p`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n[0; p]\n\\]"}

(p | q)) \\]\n\nLet's simplify the left side:\n\\[ (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) \\]\nUsing the distributive law, we can try to simplify the right side of the equivalence as well. However, the right side \\((p | q) \\& (! (p | q))\\) simplifies directly to:\n\\[ (p | q) \\& (! (p | q)) ::= 0 \\]\nbecause \\(A \\& !A ::= 0\\), where \\(A ::= (p | q)\\).\n\nThe left side \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q)\\) doesn't necessarily simplify to 0 without more context or information. To further simplify or prove equivalence, we need to test a few truth values:\n- If \\(p ::= 1, q ::= 1\\), then \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::= (1 \\& 0) | (0 \\& 1) ::= 0 | 0 ::= 0\\)\n- If \\(p ::= 1, q ::= 0\\), then \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::= (1 \\& 1) | (0 \\& 0) ::= 1 | 0 ::= 1\\)\n- If \\(p ::= 0, q ::= 1\\), then \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::= (0 \\& 0) | (1 \\& 1) ::= 0 | 1 ::= 1\\)\n- If \\(p ::= 0, q ::= 0\\), then \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::= (0 \\& 1) | (1 \\& 0) ::= 0 | 0 ::= 0\\)\n\nThus, the left side \\((p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q)\\) does not always equal the right side \\((p | q) \\& (! (p | q)) ::= 0\\).\n\nSince the second equivalence does not hold in all cases, the answer is: [[B];[B]]."}

No\n(1) (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r)\n(2) (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze each equivalence step by step according to the given rules.\n\n### Sub-question 1: (p ⇓ q) ⇓ r ::=:: p ⇓ (q ⇓ r)\n\n1. **Express in terms of AND and NOT:**\n   - By definition, \\( p \\downarrow q \\) means \\( \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( (p \\downarrow q) \\downarrow r \\) means \\( \\neg (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\vee \\neg r \\).\n2. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - Use De Morgan's Law: \\( \\neg (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) = p \\wedge q \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( (p \\downarrow q) \\downarrow r = (p \\wedge q) \\vee \\neg r \\).\n3. **Express \\( p \\downarrow (q \\downarrow r) \\):**\n   - \\( q \\downarrow r \\) means \\( \\neg q \\vee \\neg r \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( p \\downarrow (q \\downarrow r) \\) means \\( \\neg p \\vee (\\neg q \\vee \\neg r) \\).\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - The expression \\( \\neg p \\vee (\\neg q \\vee \\neg r) \\) means \\( (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\vee \\neg r \\).\n5. **Compare the simplified expressions:**\n   - We have \\( (p \\downarrow q) \\downarrow r = (p \\wedge q) \\vee \\neg r \\).\n   - And \\( p \\downarrow (q \\downarrow r) = \\neg p \\vee (\\neg q \\vee \\neg r) \\).\n   - These two expressions are not always logically equivalent. For example, if \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), and \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( (p \\downarrow q) \\downarrow r = 1 \\downarrow 1 = 1 \\), but \\( p \\downarrow (q \\downarrow r) = 1 \\downarrow 1 = 1 \\). However, for \\( p = 0 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), and \\( r = 1 \\), \\( (p \\downarrow q) \\downarrow r = 1 \\downarrow 1 = 1 \\), but \\( p \\downarrow (q \\downarrow r) = 0 \\downarrow 1 = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the first equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question 2: (p ⇑ q) ⇑ r ::=:: p ⇑ (q ⇑ r)\n\n1. **Express in terms of AND and NOT:**\n   - By definition, \\( p \\uparrow q \\) means \\( \\neg p \\wedge \\neg q \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( (p \\uparrow q) \\uparrow r \\) means \\( \\neg (\\neg p \\wedge \\neg q) \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n2. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - Use De Morgan's Law: \\( \\neg (\\neg p \\wedge \\neg q) = p \\vee q \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( (p \\uparrow q) \\uparrow r = (p \\vee q) \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n3. **Express \\( p \\uparrow (q \\uparrow r) \\):**\n   - \\( q \\uparrow r \\) means \\( \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( p \\uparrow (q \\uparrow r) \\) means \\( \\neg p \\wedge (\\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) \\).\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - The expression \\( \\neg p \\wedge (\\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) \\) means \\( \\neg p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n5. **Compare the simplified expressions:**\n   - We have \\( (p \\uparrow q) \\uparrow r = (p \\vee q) \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n   - And \\( p \\uparrow (q \\uparrow r) = \\neg p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r \\).\n   - These two expressions are not always logically equivalent. For example, if \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 1 \\), and \\( r = 0 \\), then \\( (p \\uparrow q) \\uparrow r = 1 \\uparrow 0 = 0 \\), but \\( p \\uparrow (q \\uparrow r) = 1 \\uparrow 0 = 0 \\). However, for \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), and \\( r = 1 \\), \\( (p \\uparrow q) \\uparrow r = 0 \\uparrow 1 = 0 \\), but \\( p \\uparrow (q \\uparrow r) = 1 \\uparrow 1 = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the second equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n[[B];[B]]"}

The expression \\((\\neg p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge r) \\vee (\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge r)\\) already includes all the required propositional variables and their negations, and we can see that both terms are minimal conjunctive clauses.

According to Method A, which involves changing the quality of the original proposition and replacing the predicate with its contrary, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Change the quality of the original proposition:** The original proposition is an universal affirmative (A) statement, \"All S is P,\" where S is \"correct reasoning\" and P is \"formally correct reasoning.\" Changing the quality from affirmative to negative gives us \"No correct reasoning is formally correct reasoning\" (which is not suitable for our goal).\n\n2. **Replace the predicate with its contrary:** Since we need the predicate to be about \"formally correct reasoning\" and to end up with a positive statement about it, we reverse the process and consider the original proposition in a way that directly benefits the predicate transformation and subject shift. \n\nInstead of directly changing to a negative and then reversing, we simplify the process to directly apply the transformation as per the requirements of Method A:\n- The original universal affirmative: All S (correct reasoning) is P (formally correct reasoning).\n- Applying Method A: Change the quality and replace the predicate. However, since we need directly to make \"formally correct reasoning\" the subject, we can infer:\n- Some non-formally correct reasoning is not correct reasoning.\n\nBut to directly address the instruction's need for a transformation with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in a simple form, the most direct and appropriate method is Method A. Thus, using Method A, we can infer:\n- Some formally correct reasoning is correct reasoning.\n\nThus, the correct method is [[A]]."}

MIP (M is all P)\n2. M()S (S relates to M in some way)\n\nWe need to find a valid mood that fits the form MIP -> S()P.\n\nLet's examine each valid mood for Figure I:\n- **AAA**: All M is P, all M is S, and all S is P.\n- **EAE**: No M is P, all M is S, and no S is P.\n- **AII**: All M is P, some M is S, and some S is P.\n- **EIO**: No M is P, some M is S, and some S is not P.\n\nGiven that MIP is provided and follows the meaning of an E proposition (no M is P), we can rule out AAA and AII as they do not fit the EIP form directly.\n\nThus, we are left with:\n- **EAE**: No M is P, all M is S, and no S is P. This does not fit as we don't have an \"All M is S\" stated.\n- **EIO**: No M is P, some M is S, and some S is not P. This fits as it allows for the middle term M having some relation to S, and the conclusion linking S to P while being negated.\n\nHence, the valid mood that fits MIP and the conclusion S()P in Figure I is EIO.\n\nThe correct format is:\n\\[\\boxed{[EIO; EIO]}\\]"}

The phrase \"has always worked diligently in the past\" can be represented as \"Lao Chen worked diligently from the start of the past until now.\"\n2. In terms of the logical propositions, \"always worked diligently in the past\" can be expressed as \"A¬p,\" which means \"a past period of diligent work\" where the period is from the start of the past until now.\n\n### Applying the Inference Formula:\nThe given inference formula is:\n(5) \\( Ap \\rightarrow \\neg A\\lnot p \\)\n\nThis formula can be read as: \"If there has been a past period of diligent work (Ap), then there has not been a past period of non-diligent work (A¬p).\"\n\n### Translation of the Given Statement:\n- \"Lao Chen has always worked diligently in the past\" is expressed as \\( Ap \\).\n- Therefore, based on the formula, it can be inferred that \\( A\\lnot p \\) (the period of non-diligent work in the past) is false.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\nA. \"It is not that Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past.\"\n   - This means Mr. Chan has been working seriously in the past, which aligns with \\( \\neg A\\lnot p \\) and is a correct inference from the given formula.\n\nB. \"Mr. Chen has always been serious about his work in the future.\"\n   - This statement is about the future and does not follow from the given formula which is about the past.\n\nC. \"Mr. Chen will start working seriously in March next year.\"\n   - This statement is also about the future and is not a direct inference from the given formula.\n\nD. \"Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past.\"\n   - This means \\( A\\lnot p \\), which contradicts the given statement and the inference formula (since \\( Ap \\rightarrow \\neg A\\lnot p \\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]"}

Specifically:\n\n1. We know that Alice and Bob individually firm beliefs are true, i.e., `B_A(2+2=4)` and `B_B(2+2=4)`, where `B_i(p)` represents that individual `i` firmly believes proposition `p`.\n   \n2. According to the Definition of Common Belief, if `p` is a common belief within the group `G` (in this case, the group consists of Alice and Bob), then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds. This means that if 2 plus 2 equals 4 is a common belief amongst Alice and Bob, both Alice and Bob must firmly believe it.\n\nThis implies:\n- Alice firmly believes 2 plus 2 equals 4 (`B_A(2+2=4)`)\n- Bob firmly believes 2 plus 2 equals 4 (`B_B(2+2=4)`)\n\nSince these beliefs are stated to be common, the correct interpretation according to the given choices is that:\n\n- Both Alice and Bob know that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nThus, the answer is [[A]]."}

This implies that the loop will terminate when `φ` is true. Therefore, we need to express the condition where `φ` is true or the loop continues to execute only if `φ` is not yet true followed by the loop again.\n\nGiven her belief, the expression simplifies directly to the condition where `φ` is true, which can be represented as follows:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]φ \\equiv φ \\]\n\nThus, the logical expression representing Alice's belief is:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]φ \\equiv φ \\]\n\nIn the format of [[]], the final answer is:\n\n\\[ [c*]φ ≡ φ \\]"}

People rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm.\n2. People strike cold stones, and the stones can spark.\n3. People continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot.\n\nThese examples show that different types of movements (rubbing, striking, hammering) can generate heat.\n\n### Applying the Logical Methods:\n\n1. **Method ⸮**: This method looks for a common cause (S) among multiple scenarios where P occurs, but other conditions A, B, C, etc., differ. This is not the case here since the movements vary but the outcome (heat) is consistent.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method checks if P occurs only when S is present and not when S is absent. This is not applicable as the scenario does not state that the conditions are absent.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This method involves a positive group where S and P occur together, and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. The given scenario does not provide a negative group or any absence of S leading to absence of P.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method looks for a relationship where changes in S correspond to changes in P, which aligns with the given scenarios. However, it does not specifically require presence/absence of other conditions, and it seems the method of exploring the movement leading to heat fits more directly here.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves complex interactions and causal relationships between multiple variables, whereas the given scenario is simpler and directly links the movement to the heat generation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most fitting method is **Method ⵣ** as it directly examines the relationship between the movement (S) and the heat generation (P).\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

This indicates a correlation between changes in water temperature and changes in the time a person can stay in the water.\n\n### Applying the Logic Rule:\n1. **Method ⸮** - This method involves observing that S and P occur together in various conditions where other factors differ. This method does not fit because it does not necessarily show a change in one variable following the change in another.\n\n2. **Method ؆** - This method indicates that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This is not directly applicable here as we are not stating absence and presence of P.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** - This method requires a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S and P do not occur together. This method is not directly fitting as the problem does not provide such contrasting groups.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** - This method states that changes in S correspond to changes in P. This fits our scenario as the increase in water temperature (S) results in an increase in the time a person can stay in the water (P).\n\n5. **Method ⚘** - This method involves complex relationships involving multiple factors. The given scenario does not present such complex relationships.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the scenario directly illustrates that changes in water temperature (S) result in changes in the time a person can stay in the water (P), the most appropriate method is:\n\n[[D]]"}

Then bruise it. \nThe result was that the wound healed much faster in the normal millets than in those whose salivary glands had been removed.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze the given scenario step by step and see which method it aligns with.\n\nThe scenario tells us that animals with intact salivary glands (S) heal faster (P) after being injured, compared to those with removed salivary glands, which is the absence of S (S').\n\n1. **Identify the relevant properties and objects**:\n   - S = intact salivary glands\n   - P = wound healed faster\n   - A, B, C, etc., represent other conditions that are held constant in the experiment.\n\n2. **Apply the logical operations or reasoning patterns**:\n   - The scientists divided the animals into two groups where the only difference was the presence or absence of salivary glands.

This does not match our scenario as we are comparing the presence/absence of a single condition (S) rather than multiple occurrences.\n   - **Method ؆** - It states that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This matches our scenario closely.\n   - **Method ꙮ** - It involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. Our scenario only directly compares the presence and absence of S (salivary glands) to P (wound healing).\n   - **Method ⵣ** - It involves observing changes in S correspond to changes in P. While this is somewhat related, the scenario is more about the presence/absence rather than changes in the condition.\n   - **Method ⚘** - It involves a more complex causal chain, which does not fit our simple comparison of the effect of salivary glands on wound healing.\n\nGiven this analysis, the method that best fits the scenario is **_method ؆**.\n\n[[B]]"}

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the properties and objects in the problem:**\n   - Property (S): Family education style (actively participates and encourages emotions vs. passive and negative).\n   - Object (P): Children's emotional intelligence.\n\n2. **Analyze the given information:**\n   - **Positive group:** Families where the education style is actively participative and encouraging of emotions (S), and children show higher levels of emotional intelligence (P).\n   - **Negative group:** Families where the education style is passive and negative (absence of S), and children show lower levels of emotional intelligence (absence of P).\n\n3. **Apply the logic rules:**\n\n   - ** thẳng line (⸮ method):** This method requires multiple cases where S and P occur together in different conditions.

Recall that \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg p \\lor q \\) and \\( \\neg p \\rightarrow q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( p \\lor q \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n- \\( (\\neg p \\lor q) \\land (p \\lor q) \\)\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n- \\( (\\neg p \\land p) \\lor (\\neg p \\land q) \\lor (p \\land q) \\lor (q \\land q) \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg p \\land p \\) is a contradiction (always false), it can be eliminated:\n- \\( \\neg p \\land q \\lor p \\land q \\lor q \\land q \\)\n\nFurther simplification using \\( q \\land q \\equiv q \\):\n- \\( \\neg p \\land q \\lor p \\land q \\lor q \\)\n\nFactoring out \\( q \\):\n- \\( q \\land ( \\neg p \\lor p + 1 ) \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n- \\( q \\)\n\nHowever, the initial form \\((p \\rightarrow q) \\land (\\neg p \\rightarrow q)\\) does not simplify directly to a contradiction or a consistent single statement but rather indicates a scenario where \\( q \\) can be derived independently of \\( p \\).

This inference seems to go beyond the context of the actions described.\n\n   - **C% Principle:**\n     - This principle focuses on minimizing the amount of information communicated.\n     - The actions described (baby crying, mother picking up baby) do not suggest any need for minimal information. The inference is not about minimizing the words used but making a logical leap.\n\n   - **C! Principle:**\n     - This principle ensures that the speaker does not use unnecessary or overly marked language if a simpler expression is sufficient.\n     - The inference \"The mother is the baby's mother\" could have been made clearer and less marked based on the context provided. The information given does not demand such a strong conclusion but rather a direct, unmarked expression of the relationship, if it is to be inferred.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The inference \"The mother is the baby's mother\" is making a broader claim than the immediate actions suggest. It requires a logical leap that is not minimized in terms of the communicated content and could be expressed more clearly and directly.\n   - Therefore, the principle that aligns with this type of broader, indirect inference, thus aligning with avoiding overly marked expressions when unnecessary, is the C! Principle.\n\n[[C]]"}

Instead, it’s a straightforward and common expression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe inference fits more with the common understanding derived from the role of a nurse rather than a strict application of the minimalization or avoidance of marked expressions.

Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess is a case in point. Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey. Currently, we must change, make our bodies smaller, but more solid, and we will become invincible.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. **Sun Wukong's Battle with the Iron Fan Princess**: This example uses a specific instance (Sun Wukong's strategy) to illustrate how to deal with a powerful opponent.\n2. **The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\"**: Another specific instance (the donkey's strategy in facing tigers) is used to support the argument.\n3. **Application to Modern Context**: Lastly, the examples are generalized to the current situation of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army facing Japanese forces, emphasizing the need to adapt and remain capable.\n\n### Analysis of Argumentation Methods:\n- **E+ Method**: Uses specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition.\n- **Syl+ Method**: Uses universal propositions and syllogistic reasoning.\n- **Metaph+ Method**: Uses metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic.\n- **Case+ Method**: Proves the truth of a proposition by discussing each case separately.\n- **Contra- Method**: Confirms the truth of an original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition.\n- **Elim- Method**: Determines the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities as false.\n\nThe text predominantly uses specific instances to draw parallels and support the argument. It uses the experiences of Sun Wukong and the donkey as concrete examples to make a point about dealing with powerful opponents.

Then, it directly supports the necessity of light's mass by stating that if light were massless, it would not be able to generate such pressure.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n- **E+ Method**: This method uses specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition. However, the given statement does not present any specific instances but rather a general physical principle.\n  \n- **Syl+ Method**: This method uses universal propositions as premises and supports conclusions through syllogistic reasoning. Although the reasoning involves a form of logical argument, it does not use universal propositions in a syllogistic form but rather a direct association.\n  \n- **Metaph+ Method**: This method uses metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic. The given statement does not use any metaphors.\n  \n- **Case+ Method**: This method discusses various cases to prove that a proposition holds true under various conditions. The statement does not break down the argument into cases.\n  \n- **Contra- Method**: This method indirectly confirms the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition. Here, the argument does not refute any contrary proposition but rather logically supports the necessity of the proposition through a physical effect.\n  \n- **Elim- Method**: This method indirectly determines the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities as false. The statement suggests that the only valid explanation for the pressure is that light has mass, implying the elimination of alternatives.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe argumentation method used is to eliminate other possibilities as false, directly supporting the proposition that light has mass.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[F]]."}

This is a process of evaluating each case independently to find the most likely suspect.\n   - This aligns with the Case+ Method, which involves proving the truthfulness under various conditions by discussing each case separately.\n\n3. **Compare with the Given Methods:**\n   - **E+ Method (Specific instances):** This involves using a direct and specific example. The question does not directly prove the truth of the proposition through a single instance but through a method that systematically examines and eliminates possibilities.\n   - **Syl+ Method (Universal propositions):** This involves using universal propositions in syllogistic reasoning, not the empirical checking of each student's timetable and trajectory.\n   - **Metaph+ Method (Metaphors):** This involves the use of metaphors, which is not relevant to the step-by-step elimination process described.\n   - **Case+ Method (Several cases):** This aligns with examining each student's timetables and trajectories as separate cases to identify the suspect.\n   - **Contra- Method (Refuting the contrary):** This involves refuting a contrary proposition, which is not the method used here.\n   - **Elim- Method (Eliminating possibilities):** This involves showing the original proposition is true by negating other possibilities, which closely mirrors the process of identifying the suspect by eliminating other students.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The method used in the question is best described as the systematic elimination of possibilities, which fits the definition of the Case+ Method, even though Elim- Method is also very close to the description provided.\n\n**Answer: [D]**"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented.
