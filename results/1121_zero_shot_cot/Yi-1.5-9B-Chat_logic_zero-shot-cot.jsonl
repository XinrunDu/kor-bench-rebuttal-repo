Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither\n\n1. The first formula is `(1 ) p1 =::>(p1 ||p2 ||p3 )`.\n\n   - To determine if it's a Truth Formula, a Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we'll evaluate the formula under all possible conditions for p1, p2, and p3.\n   - If p1 is true, the formula is true because true implies true.\n   - If p1 is false, the only way the formula can be false is if both p2 and p3 are also false.\n   - Thus, the formula can be true under some conditions and false under others, making it neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n   - Answer for (1): C. Neither\n\n2. The second formula is `(2 ) (p1 =::>~p1 )=::>~p2`.\n\n   - First, let's simplify the formula by negating the antecedent of the implication: `~p1 ||~p1`, which is equivalent to `~p1`.\n   - So, the simplified form of the formula is: `(~p1)=::>~p2`.\n   - This means that if p1 is false, then p2 must also be false.\n   - For this formula to be a Falsehood Formula, it must be false under all conditions. However, if p1 is true, the formula is still true because a true statement implies any statement (true or false).\n   - The formula is not a Falsehood Formula.\n   - To check if it's a Truth Formula, we can see that it's true when p1 is false, but not under all conditions.\n   - Thus, the formula is Neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n   - Answer for (2): C. Neither\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[C];[C]]"}

This does not directly confirm non-equivalence without a more exhaustive comparison or proof by contradiction, but based on initial simplification, it suggests they might not be equal.\n\n- **Equivalence (2)**: Similar analysis as for equivalence (1) applies, and similar to the first case, simplification does not directly confirm equivalence without further examination.\n\n**Conclusion based on initial analysis but note the need for strict proof**:\n- For Equivalence (1), the initial simplification does not strongly confirm equivalence.\n- For Equivalence (2), the initial simplification similarly does not strongly confirm equivalence.\n\nGiven the initial approach and the logical structure, the answer to whether the equivalences are valid is not directly supported by the initial simplification alone, which suggests \"B. No\" for both sub-questions, indicating that based on a cursory examination, the equivalences do not appear to be straightforwardly valid according to the basic logical equivalences provided. However, a more rigorous proof or detailed comparison would be required to definitively confirm this.\n\nThe answer format, thus, based on the initial assessment but acknowledging the need for a more rigorous approach, is [[B];[B]]."}

Therefore, `D1` (Person C's statements are entirely correct) should be the negation of the conjunction of the truth values of A and B, which is `((! (! p & q)) & (p & ! q))` (the negation of Person A's statement and the conjunction of Person B's statement).\n- To represent that Person C got half right, we would need to find a statement that is true under the same circumstances as `D1`, but this is not possible given the statements and Professor Wang's remarks. Therefore, we do not need to define `D2`.\n- Since Person C's statement is correct, `D3` (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect) would be false or `0`, as it cannot be true when exactly one of `p`, `q`, and `r` is true, as Person C correctly stated that Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[[C1 = ! p & q ];[C2 = (! p & q) | (p & ! q) ];[C3 = p & ! q ]]\n[D1 = ((!

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's break down the task and apply the given logical rules step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant properties and objects\nThe given formula is (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r). We need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in this formula.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the logical operations and reasoning patterns\nWe can simplify the formula by using the distributive property of the disjunction over the conjunction:\n- (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be rewritten as ¬p^(¬q^r)∨¬p^(q^r) using the associative property.\n\nNow, we can apply the distributive property again:\n- ¬p^(¬q^r)∨¬p^(q^r) becomes ¬p^((¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p))∨¬p^((q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)).\n\nSince ¬p is present in each term, we can factor it out:\n- ¬p^((¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p))∨¬p^((q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)) becomes (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p).\n\nNow, we see that both disjunctive terms are the same, so we have:\n- (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p) simplifies to (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p) which is equivalent to (¬q∨¬p∨q)^(r∨¬p), because (r∨¬p)∨(r∨¬p) is equivalent to (r∨¬p).\n\nSince ¬q∨¬p∨q is a tautology, the term becomes ¬p∨r, which is equivalent to (¬p∧¬r)∨(p∨r).\n\nNow, let's find the paired conjunctive terms of (¬p∧¬r)∨(p∨r).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the paired conjunctive terms\nSince ¬p∨r is a tautology (as it includes both ¬p and p), it does not contribute to the principal disjunctive normal form in the traditional sense. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we can consider the individual components (¬p∧¬r) and (p∨r) separately.\n\nFor (¬p∧¬r), the true assignment corresponds to 00 in binary, which is 0 in hexadecimal. So, it is denoted as m0.\n\nFor (p∨r), the false assignment corresponds to 11 in binary, which is 3 in hexadecimal. So, it is denoted as M3.\n\n### Step 4: Format the answer\nThe paired conjunctive terms in the given expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) correspond to the terms in the simplified expression (¬p∧¬r)∨(p∨r).

Each variable and its negation appear exactly once, and they are arranged in lexicographical order (¬p, ¬q, ¬r). This meets the criteria for being a paired conjunctive term since it consists of propositional variables and their negations in ascending order or in lexicographical order.\n\nTo determine the classification of this formula, we need to find the index (in hexadecimal) of the paired conjunctive term it represents. Since all three variables are negated, the true assignment of this formula would be ¬p=1, ¬q=1, ¬r=1, which corresponds to the binary number 111. The binary number 111 is equal to the hexadecimal number 7 (0x7 or F). Therefore, m0 is not applicable, and this formula can be denoted as M7, indicating it corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7.\n\nGiven this, we can now classify the formula:\n\n- It is not a tautology because the principal conjunctive normal form (or disjunctive normal form for negated formulas) does not include all 2^n paired conjunctive terms (in this case, 2^3=8 terms).\n- It is not a contradiction because the principal conjunctive normal form does include a paired conjunctive term (M7).\n- It is not a basic formula because it does not directly correspond to m0.\n- It is an all-odd formula because the index of the paired conjunctive term (M7) is an odd number (7 in hexadecimal).\n- It is not a special case like F or None of the above since it fits the criteria for an all-odd formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[DE]]"}

For a basic form, the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0. Since m0 is the representation of a false assignment corresponding to a binary number of 0, this means that in the principal disjunctive normal form, there should be only one paired conjunctive term, which is m0.\n\n2. For an all-even formula, the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even. In hexadecimal, even numbers range from 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, where 0 represents 0 (corresponding to binary 0000).\n\nCombining both criteria, we need to find the formulas that have m0 as the only paired conjunctive term in their principal disjunctive normal form. Since there are 4 propositional variables, there are a total of 16 paired conjunctive terms (2^4). However, since we are only interested in the case where m0 is the only term included, there is only 1 such formula that satisfies both conditions: m0 itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [1]."}

In this case, S1 = {1, 2, 3} where 1 represents (¬p ∨ q), 2 represents (p ∨ q), and 3 represents (q).\n- S2 is also an empty set initially, so S2 = ∅.\n\nFor the first loop iteration, we resolve the clauses in S1 since S0 is still empty.

The CNF can be directly represented as a set of clauses:\n\n\\[\\{p, p \\vee q, p \\vee \\neg q, q \\vee \\neg r, q \\vee r\\}\\]\n\nNow, let's represent each of these as they would be in the context of the resolution algorithm, which typically involves converting \\(A \\vee B\\) to \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) for simplicity in the context of the resolution rule:\n\n1. \\(p\\)\n2. \\(p \\vee q\\)\n3. \\(p \\vee \\neg q\\)\n4. \\(q \\vee \\neg r\\)\n5. \\(q \\vee r\\)\n\nWith these, we can identify the initial values for S0, S1, and S2 based on the algorithm's steps:\n\n- **S0**: Initially, this set is empty. Thus, \\(S0 = \\{\\}\\) or \\([[]]\\).\n- **S1**: This set contains all the initial simple clause sets.

C1 = p ∨ q\n2. C2 = p ∨ ¬q\n3. C3 = ¬p ∨ r\n\nNow, we'll apply the resolution algorithm to find S2 at the end of the first cycle.

Resolve C1 and C2:\n   - C = dispel(C1, C2) = dispel(p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q)\n   - Since one literal (either 'q' or '¬q') will always be true, these clauses resolve to p.\n   - Since p is already in both C1 and C2, dispel(C1, C2) = 0 (Contradiction).\n\n2. Resolve C1 and C3:\n   - C = dispel(C1, C3) = dispel(p ∨ q, ¬p ∨ r)\n   - Here, we can choose q as the literal to be resolved, making q’ = ¬q.\n   - So, dispel(C1, C3) = q’ ∨ (p ∨ r) = ¬q ∨ (p ∨ r) = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r.\n\n3.

Since it's a disjunction (OR), the final output O is \"+\".\n2. p = \"-\", q = \"+\", r = \"+\"; Similarly, both parts of the expression can be \"+\" through different combinations of truth values for p, q, and r.\n3. p = \"+\", q = \"+\", r = \"+\"; This wouldn't work because it only satisfies the first part of the expression. It would only power the circuit if the condition required (p∧q) to be \"+\" and did not allow for the flexibility of the second part (¬p∧(q∨r)).\n\nTherefore, the corresponding inputs that satisfy the condition for the output O to be \"+\" are:\n\n```\n[[-;+;-];\n [-;+;+];\n [...more combinations as per the logic described above...]]\n```\n\nRemember, the actual combinations can vary as long as they satisfy the conditions we've outlined for both parts of the expression to output \"+\".

(p∧q∧¬r)\n2. (¬p∧q)\n3. (p∨r)\n\nFor an \"-\" output, any of these cases can be true, but not all of them. Let's analyze each case individually:\n\n1. (p∧q∧¬r) results in \"-\" only if all of p, q, and ¬r are \"-\". This means p is \"-\", q is \"-\", and r is \"+\".\n2. (¬p∧q) results in \"-\" only if p is \"+\" and q is \"-\" (¬p is \"-\", which means p is \"+\").\n3. (p∨r) results in \"-\" only if p is \"-\" and r is \"-\" (since a \"-\" OR a \"-\" gives \"-\"). If p is \"+\", this case wouldn't directly result in \"-\" without the first case also being \"-\", but since we are looking for combinations that satisfy the entire expression, we consider this case when p is \"-\".\n\nGiven these conditions, we can list the possible combinations of inputs that satisfy the entire expression:\n\n- Case 1: (p=\"-\", q=\"-\", r=\"+\") This case covers all bases directly.\n- Case 2: To account for the possibility of case 2 being true without case 1 and 3 being true, we need to find an overlap where p can be \"+\", q is \"-\", but the overall output needs to be \"-\". However, since case 2 alone doesn't contribute to an \"-\" output without also involving p as \"-\" through the overlap with case 1 or 3, we focus on combinations that include case 1 or 3 being true to satisfy the entire expression.\n- Case 3: This complements case 1. If p is \"-\" due to case 1 or due to making case 3 true solely, and r is \"-\", this combination, while not fulfilling case 2 alone (since p would naturally be \"+\" in that context if not considering case 1), fits within the broader solution set that includes an \"-\" output.\n\nTherefore, the primary combinations that satisfy the entire expression (including the \"-\" output condition) are focused on where p and q are consistent across conditions that lead to an \"-\" output, with r's condition being more about complementing the overall expression rather than ensuring the \"-\" output exclusively through this clause.\n\nGiven the rule that the expression can be true with any of these cases, but not all at once, and the output condition being an \"-\", the simplest and most direct solution that satisfies the entire expression without the need for complex combinations that might arise from considering case 2 alone (since it inherently overlaps with case 1 or 3) is:\n\n- [p=\"-\", q=\"-\", r=\"+\"]\n\nThis satisfies all parts of the expression that lead to an \"-\" output. The question asks for multiple inputs that satisfy this condition, and given the logical structure of the expression and the output requirement, this is the primary and simplest combination to fulfill the entire expression's condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[];[];[]] = [\"-\";\"-\";\"+\"]"}

According to the rule, we replace \\(a\\) with \\(a'\\), which means \\(a = 0\\). Thus, the formula becomes \\(F(f(x, 0), y) \\rightarrow F(g(x, y), z)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Replace functions gJ and fJ**\nThe formula now has two functions that need to be replaced with their implementations under 𝐽. So, \\(f(x, 0)\\) becomes \\(f_J(x, 0) = x + 0 = x\\), and \\(g(x, y)\\) becomes \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\). The formula now reads \\(F(x, y) \\rightarrow F(x * y, z)\\).\n\n**Step 3: Replace predicate FJ**\nThe predicate \\(F(x, y)\\) is replaced with \\(F_J(x, y)\\), which means \\(F(x, y)\\) is true if and only if \\(x = y\\). Thus, the formula becomes \\(x = y \\rightarrow (x * y = z)\\).\n\n**Final Implementation in [[]] format:**\n\\[[x = y \\rightarrow (x * y = z)]\\]\n\nThis is how we apply the given logical operations and rules to the original formula to find its implementation under the interpretation 𝐽. The final answer adheres to the specified notation and symbols."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's break down the statements made by Inspectors A and C according to the logic rule provided:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes. This is a Universal Affirmative (A) proposition. The logical form is AIP, where S = \"individual businesses,\" P = \"pay taxes,\" and C = \"did not.\"\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes. This is a Particular Affirmative (I) proposition. The logical form is SIP, where S = \"individual businesses,\" P = \"pay taxes,\" and C = \"have.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these two propositions according to the relationships defined in the logic rule:\n\n- Relationships between A propositions and I propositions are denoted by %.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said is:\n\n[[%]]"}

This leaves us with two possibilities: EAE or EIO.\n\nHowever, the conclusion S()P suggests that the predicate of the conclusion (P) is something that the subject of the major premise (P) cannot have, given that the middle term is negatively related (E relation). This rules out EAE because an EAE syllogism would lead to a positive conclusion. Therefore, the mood must be EIO.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the remaining terms.

Use p to indicate that \"Li Ming plays well\" and q to indicate that \"he wins the championship\".\n\n- \"If Li Ming plays well\" can be represented as the implication p → q.\n- \"It is possible for him to win the championship\" can be symbolized as $q.\n\nSo, the symbolization for \"If Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship\" is:\n($p > $q)\n\nPutting both parts together in [[];[]] format:\n\n[ (#p = $!p); ($p > $q) ]"}

For each action (p, q, r), we apply the ‽ (prohibition) symbol.\n\n2. **\"Abuse of the elderly, women, and children\"** involves three separate propositions: p (abuse the elderly), q (abuse women), and r (abuse children). The use of \"and\" between these propositions suggests that all must be understood together in the context of prohibition.\n\nGiven these considerations, the proposition can be symbolized by applying the prohibition modality to each individual action and then ensuring that all are prohibited together. This translates to:\n\n- ‽p for \"It is prohibited to abuse the elderly,\"\n- ‽q for \"It is prohibited to abuse women,\" and\n- ‽r for \"It is prohibited to abuse children.\"\n\nSince the actions are grouped by \"and,\" the proposition can be combined using conjunction (represented by the & symbol in propositional logic). Therefore, the symbolic representation for the entire proposition is:\n\n```\n‽p & ‽q & ‽r\n```\n\nThis format adheres to the specified logical rules and format, directly symbolizing the prohibition of each action and combining them using the conjunction operator to reflect the \"and\" in the original statement. \n\nPlease note, the question asked for the answer in the format [[]], which typically does not fit the symbolic representation of logical propositions directly. However, to comply with the requested format in a way that attempts to mimic the logic notation, one could interpret it as representing a compound proposition containing individual prohibited actions. In that abstract interpretation, the answer could be represented as:\n\n```\n[[‽p], [‽q], [‽r]]\n```\n\nThis is a less conventional use of the notation and is meant to encapsulate each prohibited action within its own set to mirror the structure of the conjunction in the logical representation. The primary answer is more standard and directly represents the logical proposition, but the adjusted answer attempts to align with the requested format as closely as possible."}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ꙮ Method   D. ⵣ Method   E. ⚘ Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A/B/C/D/E]] A"}

This is because the experiment involves observing two outcomes (the presence or absence of salivary glands) in different conditions while other conditions remain the same, and noting the difference in outcomes (the rate of wound healing).\n\nThe experiment can be represented as follows according to the rules provided:\n1. Condition with salivary glands: S (salivary glands present) A B P (faster healing)  \n2. Condition without salivary glands: - S (salivary glands absent) A B - P (slower healing)\n\nThis directly aligns with the definition of Method ⸮, which states that if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ, then S and P may have a causal relationship.

In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes.

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

GB Paradox - This paradox arises when two contradictory hypotheses cannot both be true, but can't determine which is correct. Although this paradox involves contradictions, it doesn't relate to the issue of the validity of the evidence itself.\n\nB. BC Paradox - This paradox concerns the confirmation of a universal hypothesis, which does not directly apply to this situation since it's not about confirming the hypothesis but rather about a contradiction between accepted hypotheses and observable facts.\n\nC. LS Paradox - This paradox is relevant when multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses lead to a logical consequence that contradicts another accepted hypothesis. In our case, hypotheses (A) and (B) lead to the logical consequence that penguins fly, which contradicts our observation that they don't.\n\nTherefore, this situation belongs to the LS Paradox.\n\nAnswer: [[C]]"}

The LS Paradox, as defined in the logic rule, involves a situation where there are multiple reasonable hypotheses (r_1, r_2, ..., r_n), and the logical consequence of their conjunction (r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n) contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis (r_n+1). \n\n4. In this case, the expression ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥) only represents a contradiction between two hypotheses (r_1 and r_2) but does not involve a series of hypotheses (r_1, r_2, ..., r_n) nor another reasonably accepted hypothesis r_n+1 that contradicts their conjunction.\n\n5.

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm\" does not directly adhere to any of the C*, C%, or C! principles as outlined in the logic rule. However, we can analyze the scenario to see if there is any implicit application of these principles based on the context provided.\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle focuses on the speaker's and hearer's criteria regarding the strength of information in statements. The example does not explicitly apply any of the CQ1 or CQ2 criteria from the C* Principle.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle is about speaking minimally to achieve communication goals. The example does not explicitly apply CI1 or CI2 criteria from the C% Principle. However, one could argue that the statement's brevity (opening the box, beer is warm) is a form of minimalization, aiming to convey the fact without elaborating on other potential items in the box or the context of the situation. This interpretation leans towards an application of the spirit of the C% Principle's Minimalization Criterion.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle is about avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions unnecessarily. The example does not utilize such expressions; in fact, it uses straightforward language.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **C* Principle** does not directly apply.\n- **C% Principle** could be seen as indirectly applied through the interpretation of minimalization in communication, suggesting that the speaker is trying to convey only the necessary information to the point (that the beer is warm) without elaborating on all possible contents of the food box.\n- **C! Principle** does not directly apply.\n\nSince the provided scenario most closely relates to an implicit application of the spirit of the C% Principle's Minimalization Criterion, though not a direct match, the closest answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```\n\nThis choice aligns with interpreting the statement as an example of minimal communication, focusing on the key information (the beer's warmth) without detailing the full contents of the food box, which aligns with the principle of speaking as little as possible while effectively conveying the intended message. However, it's important to note that the scenario does not fit neatly into the specific criteria of any one principle outlined."}

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
