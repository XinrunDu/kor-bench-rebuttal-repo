Apply the affine coding function for each character:\n\n   - y_N = (A * 7 + B) mod 26 = (3 * 7 + 5) mod 26 = 26, so y_N = 0, which corresponds to 'X' in the affine alphabet.\n   - y_G = (A * 5 + B) mod 26 = (3 * 5 + 5) mod 26 = 20.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Keystream Generation for the first character 'D':\n   - Keystream value y = 14: Move card A down by one: 9,  **25**, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21 \n   - Move card B down by two: 9, 25, **44**, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21 \n   - Perform a \"triple cut\": 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 54, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26 \n   - Perform a \"count cut\": 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 54, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26 \n   - Top card is 29: 29, 20,... Calculate (14)th card which is 14.\n\n4. Combine the positional value of 'D' (1) and the keystream value (14) with mod 26: (1+14) % 26 = x = 15, which corresponds to 'G' in the LETTERS list.\n5. Append 'G' to the ciphertext: \"GD\".\n6. Repeat the process for each character in the plaintext:\n   - 'JW' encrypts to 'OC': (7+14) % 26 = 21 and (3+14) % 26 = 17, respectively.\n   - 'NC' encrypts to 'DH': (13+8) % 26 = 1 and (7+8) % 26 = 15.\n   - 'YEVV' encrypts to 'XRAR' (17+10) % 26 = 11, (14+10) % 26 = 4, (11+11) % 26 = 9, and (7+11) % 26 = 13, respectively.\n   - 'NB' encrypts to 'WW': (13+7) % 26 = 9 and (2+7) % 26 = 9.\n\n**Decryption Process (exact opposite of encryption process):**\n\n1. For each ciphertext character c, we need to decrypt it by finding its original position in the LETTERS list and generating the corresponding keystream value y.\n2. The positional value of the first character 'G' (15) is used to generate the keystream for 'GD':\n   - Keystream value y = 14: Calculate the card corresponding to 15 -> The 16th card in the initial sequence is 17, which is the value of the card that will be moved next (i.e., the value of the 15th card).\n    \n3. Decrypt 'D': \n    - y = 14: z-y = 15-14 mod 26 = 1 -> 'D'\n    - 'D' is the first character of the plaintext.\n4. Repeat the process for the remaining ciphertext characters:\n   - 'OC' decrypts to 'JW': The corresponding keystream values are 15 (calculated similarly as above) and 17, which lead to (7+15) % 26 = 3 and (17-7) % 26 = 21, resulting in 'JW'.\n   - 'DH' decrypts to 'NC': Keystream value 8, following the calculation similar to step 2. Then, (7-8) % 26 = 13 and (1-8) % 26 = 1, resulting in 'NC'.\n   - 'XRAR' decrypts to 'YEVV': The keystream values are 11, 4, 1, and 3. These lead to (11-11) % 26 = 0, (12-4) % 26 = 8, (15-1) % 26 = 14, and ((17+3) mod 26) + 7 = 11, which give us 'Y', 'E', 'V', 'V', and 'R'.\n   - 'WW' decrypts to 'NB': Keystream value 7. This leads to (9-7) % 26 = 2 and ((13+7) mod 26) + 7 = 9. These correspond to 'N' and 'B'.\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is: **DJWNCYEVVNB**."}

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

Rotate the inner disk for the 'Z' character.\n- 'Z' is the second character, so we rotate the disk one more time.\n- The new inner disk is \"QWERTYUIOPZXCVBNMASDFGHJKL\".\n\n4.

For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\"\nperiod: 8\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Start with Reel 1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\".\n2. Find the first character of the ciphertext, which is 'W'. 'W' is located at the end of Reel 1, so we go around to the start of the reel and find the previous charater, 'Z'.\n3. Move to the next Reel, Reel 2: \"ACDEHFIJKTLMOUVYGZNPQXRWSB\".\n4. Find the second character of the ciphertext, which is 'D'. 'D' corresponds to 'C' in this reel. \n\nSo, the decrypted answer is [[ZC]]."}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"BF#V#Z#H#*FSXFNMDSC*ETZYKNUCB*SKSRZMGF*B#P#V#D#*\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. Padding: The plaintext is already a single character, so no padding is needed.\n\n2. Block Splitting: Divide the plaintext into 8-byte blocks. Since \"N\" is a single character, it needs to be padded to make it an 8-byte block. So, we add the null character \"\\x00\" to make it \"N\\x00\".\n\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert \"N\\x00\" to bytes => b'N\\x00'\n   - XOR with Key: Apply XOR with the fixed key => b'N\\x00' ^ b'1234567890ABCDEF' = b'\\xf5o@\\x9e\\x90'\n   - Substitute: Use S_BOX to substitute high and low bits. The substitution for this block is as follows:\n      - 0x0E (ASCII value of 'N') & 0x0F => 0x0C\n      - 0x00 (ASCII value of '\\x00') & 0x0F => 0x00\n      => 0x0C00\n   - Permute: Rotate each byte left by 1 bit. The permuted block is: 0x0A08\n   - XOR with Key: Apply XOR with the fixed key again. For each byte:\n       - 0x0A ^ 0x34 = 0xD\n       - 0x08 ^ 0x56 = 0xAE\n\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string: \"dAEII\" \n\n5. Concatenate: Since we only have one block, the final ciphertext is \"dAEII\". \n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[dAEII]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The provided encryption scheme is quite complex, encompassing multiple stages of substitution and permutation. However, I can assist with the decryption process step by step in accordance with the defined rules. \n\n1. Divide into blocks: The provided ciphertext, \"809C9986938C9784\", is broken into two blocks, each being 8 bytes long (or 16 characters per block): [\"809C9986\", \"938C9784\"]\n2. Convert blocks to bytes: Each block is converted from hexadecimal to bytes. \n    - \"809C9986\" = [128, 156, 153, 134]\n    - \"938C9784\" = [147, 140, 151, 132]\n3. XOR with Key: Here we XOR the above-decoded bytes with our fixed key, \"1234567890ABCDEF\".\n   - [128, 156, 153, 134] ^ '1234567890ABCDEF' = [113, 96, 137, 113]\n   - [147, 140, 151, 132] ^ '1234567890ABCDEF' = [132, 91, 145, 117]\n4. Substitute using INV_S_BOX: Using our INV_S_BOX, we replace certain bits in the XOR'd byte blocks.\n   - [113, 96, 137, 113] = [0x77, 0x5F, 0x8D, 0x77] becomes [0x71, 0x5D, 0x81, 0x71]\n   - [132, 91, 145, 117] = [0x86, 0x5B, 0x8B, 0x6D] becomes [0x82, 0x5A, 0x89, 0x69]\n5. XOR with Key: XOR the byte blocks once more with the fixed key.\n   - [0x71, 0x5D, 0x81, 0x71] ^ '1234567890ABCDEF' = [89, 121, 108, 95]\n   - [0x82, 0x5A, 0x89, 0x69] ^ '1234567890ABCDEF' = [114, 118, 123, 98]\n6. Inverse Permute: Rotate each byte right by 1 bit, which effectively undoes the permutation step in encryption.\n   - 89 >> 1 = 44, 121 >> 1 = 60, 108 >> 1 = 54, 95 >> 1 = 47\n   - 114 >> 1 = 57, 118 >> 1 = 59, 123 >> 1 = 61, 98 >> 1 = 49\n7. Convert bytes to text: Convert the byte blocks back to text. We find the following: \n   - [44, 60, 54, 47]  >> ASCII is \"T=6X-\".\n   - [57, 59, 61, 49] >> ASCII is \"9;=>\".\n \nNow, when we concatenate the decrypted blocks, we get the plaintext: \"**SIBA NONA**\". \n \n[[SIBA NONA]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The decrypted answer is: [[FELIPELINHARESZARAT]]"}
