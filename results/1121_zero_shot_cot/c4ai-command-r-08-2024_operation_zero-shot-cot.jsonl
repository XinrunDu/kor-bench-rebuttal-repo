First, let's evaluate the equation 7 ○ 2 = 180 using the given rule:\n   - 7 ○ 2 = (x * 7 + y * 2) × (7 + 2) = 180\n   - Simplifying this equation, we get: x * 7 + 2y = 90\n\n2. Now, let's evaluate the second equation:\n   - 2 ○ 3 = (x * 2 + y * 3) × (2 + 3) = 65\n   - This simplifies to: x * 2 + 3y = 35\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve this system of equations simultaneously:\n1. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 yields:\n   - 2(x * 7 + 2y) = 180\n   - 3(x * 2 + 3y) = 207\n\n2. Simplifying these equations gives:\n   - 14x + 4y = 180\n   - 6x + 9y = 207\n\n3. We can subtract the lower equations from the upper equations:\n   - (14x - 6x) + (4y - 9y) = 180 - 207\n   - 8x - 5y = -27\n\n4. Now, for the second set of equations, we can find the values of x and y independently:\n   - 4y = 27 (from the second equation)\n   - y = 27 / 4\n   - y ≈ 6.75\n\n5. Now that we found the value of y, we can substitute and find x. Using the first equation:\n   - x * 7 + 2 * (27/4) = 90\n   - 7x + 13.5 = 90\n   - 7x ≈ 76.5\n   - x ≈ 10.92857\n\n6. Since x and y are integers, we can round these values to the nearest integer:\n   - x = 11\n   - y = 7\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [[x=11, y=7]]."}

So, let's break it down:\n\nGiven equation: (X § 3) - (1 $ 4) = 2\n\nStep 1: First, let's evaluate the operations (§ and $) within the parentheses. According to the rule:\n- § means select the larger of the two numbers.\n- $ means select the smaller of the two numbers.\n\nSo, we have:\n- X is the larger number when compared to 3 (X § 3).\n- 1 is the smaller number when compared to 4 (1 $ 4).\n\nStep 2: Now, we can rewrite the equation using these evaluations:\n(X) - (1) = 2\n\nStep 3: Simplifying the equation:\nX - 1 = 2\n\nStep 4: To isolate X, we add 1 to both sides of the equation:\nX = 2 + 1\nX = 3\n\nSo, the value of X is 3.

We start from the equation given in the question: (6 ◎ 3) + (X ◎ 2) × 2 = 37 + 60i.\n\n2. Break down the custom operation: (a ◎ b) = (a + bi)^2, where 'i' represents the imaginary unit.\n\n3. For the first part:\n   - (6 ◎ 3) = (6 + 3i)^2 = (6 + 3i)(6 + 3i) \n   \n   Expanding this: (6)(6) + (6)(3i) + (3i)(6) + (3i)(3i) = 36 + 18i + 18i + 9i^2\n   Simplifying further: 36 + 36i + 9(-1) = 27 + 36i\n\n4. Now that we know (6 ◎ 3) = 27 + 36i, we can substitute it into the equation:\n    (27 + 36i) + (X ◎ 2) × 2 = 37 + 60i\n\n5. Now we solve for (X ◎ 2):\n   - (X ◎ 2) = (X + 2i)^2 = (X + 2i)(X + 2i)\n   - Expanding and simplifying leads to: X^2 + 4i^2 + 2X(2i) = X^2 + 4(-1) + 4Xi = X^2 - 4 + 8Xi\n\n6. So the new equation becomes: (27 + 36i) + 2(X^2 - 4 + 8Xi) = 37 + 60i\n\n7. Equating the real and imaginary parts on both sides:\n    - For the real parts: 27 + 2(X^2 - 4) = 37\n    Solving for X^2: 2X^2 - 8 = 10 --> 2X^2 = 18 --> X^2 = 9\n\n    - For the imaginary parts: 36 + 2(8Xi) = 60 \n     Solving for Xi: 8Xi = 24 --> Xi = 3\n\n8.
