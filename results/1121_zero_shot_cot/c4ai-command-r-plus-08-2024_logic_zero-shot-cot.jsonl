The second part becomes false when p3 is true. \n   - So, the falsity assignment is: x|✓,✓|x.\n\n2. (~p2 || p3) & (p1 =::> p2):\n   - For this formula to be false, we need to make the first part, (~p2 || p3), false and the second part, p1 =::> p2, true. \n   - The first part is false when p2 is true and p3 is false. The second part is true when p1 is true and p2 is false, or when both are false. \n   - So, the falsity assignments for this formula can be: ✓|x,x|✓|x or ✓|x,x|x.\n\n3. (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1):\n   - For this formula to be false, one of the parts must be false. \n   - The first part, p1 =::> p2, is false when p1 is true and p2 is false. \n   - The second part, (~(p1 & p3) || p1), can be false in two cases: \n     - Case 1: ~(p1 & p3) is false and p1 is false: x|x|✓.\n     - Case 2: p1 is false: x.\n   - So, the falsity assignments for this formula are: x|✓,✓|x,x|x|✓ and x|✓,x,x.\n\nSo, the final answer is: [[F:x|x,✓|✓,x|✓,✓|✓,✓|x];[F:✓|x,x|✓|x;✓|x,x];[F:x|✓,✓|x,x|x|✓;x|✓,x,x]]"}

(p > q) > r\n2. p > (q > r)\n\nNow, let's analyze the expressions using the provided equivalence rules:\nFor expression 1:\n- By rule (10), A > B can be written as !A | B.\n- Applying this to both implications, (p > q) can be written as (!p | q) > r, which is equivalent to !(p > q) | r using the same rule.\n- Now, we can use rule (12), A > B ::=:: !B > !, to get (!r > !(!p | q)) for the entire expression.\n- Simplifying the double negation in the first part, it becomes: (!r > (p | !q)).\n\nFor expression 2:\n- Using rule (10) again, we can write p > (q > r) as p > (!q | r).\n- Applying rule (12), this is equivalent to p > !(r > q)).\n- Finally, using rule (12) once more, we get (!(r > q) > !p) \n\nComparing the two resulting expressions, we can see that they are not the same, as one has r in the first part of the implication, and the other has !r. Therefore, the original expressions are not equivalent.\n\nThe answer is: [[B]]"}

The properties and objects involved are:\n- Propositional variables: p and q\n- Logical connectives: &, |, and !\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Logical Rules\n\nYou are asking for the validity of two specific equivalences, so I will address them one by one.\n\n1. Equivalence (1): p ::=:: (p&q) | (p&!q)\n   - Validity: Yes. This is a valid equivalence due to distributions of 'p' over '&'. It is a special case of the distribution rule, where A&B | A&C == A&(B|C) when A is the same on both sides of the |.\n\n2. Equivalence (2): (p&!q) | (!p&q) ::=:: (p|q) & (!(p|q))\n   - Validity: Yes. This equivalence can be derived using the given rules. Here are the steps: \n     - Start with the left-hand side: (p&!q) | (!p&q)\n     - Using distribution (rule 5): (!p&q) ::=:: (!p|p) & (!p|q)\n     - Associative property (rule 4): (!p|p)&(!p|q) ::=:: !p|(p&q)\n     - De Morgan's law (rule 6): !((p|q)) ::=:: !(p|q)\n\n   Thus, we have shown that equivalence (2) is also valid.\n\n### Response Format\n\nBased on the provided instructions, the response should adhere to the following format: [[Answer1]; [Answer2]].

Understand the Form: The expression $(p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)^{(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)}$ is in the form of an exponential expression with two parts, which we need to analyze separately.\n\n2. Identify Base and Exponent:\n   - Base: $p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$\n   - Exponent: $\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$\n\n3. Find Paired Disjunctive Terms:\n   - For the Base: The variables in the base are $p, q,$ and $r$. To form a paired disjunctive term, we need each variable and its negation to appear exactly once. So, the paired disjunctive terms for the base are $[\\neg p \\vee q \\vee r, p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg r]$.\n   - For the Exponent: The variables in the exponent are also $p, q$, and $r$. Similarly, we form the paired disjunctive terms: $[p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r, \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r]$.\n\n4. Denote the Paired Disjunctive Terms:\n   - Base: The binary representation of the assignments for the first term $\\neg p \\vee q \\vee r$ is $101$, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 5$. So, this term is denoted as $M5$. The second term, $p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg r$, is $001$ in binary, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 1$, denoted as $M1$.\n   - Exponent: Similarly, for the exponent, the first term $p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r$ is $110$ in binary, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 6$, so it is $M6$. The second term, $\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$, is $000$ in binary ($\\text{hexadecimal} 0$), denoted as $M0$.\n\n5. Final Expression:\n   The final expression can be denoted as:\n   - [[paired disjunctive terms: $M5, M1; M6, M0$];\n   - [denoted: Base: $M5, M1$, Exponent: $M6, M0$]]\n\nThis represents the paired disjunctive terms and their notation for the given expression, following the specified logical rules."}

Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p → r) ∧ (q → ¬r) ∧ (¬r → (p ∨ q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p → r) ∧ (q → ¬r) ∧ (¬r → (p ∨ q)) ↔ (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (p ∧ ¬q ∧ r), which can be denoted as m1 ∨ m2 ∨ m5. \nBased on the three true assignments represented, what are the feasible selection schemes? \n\nOnly give the letters of the people selected to go, separated by commas within a scheme, and different schemes separated by []; format: [[];[];..].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[C; B,A; A,C]"}

When n = 1, P(x) denotes the property P; when n ≥ 2, P(x1, x2, ..., xn) denotes the relationship P among x1, x2, ..., xn.\n\nPredicates without individual variables are called 0-ary predicates. For example, F(a), G(a, b), P(a1, ..., an) are all 0-ary predicates.\n\nLet D be the domain of individuals.\n\"All x in D have property F\" is symbolized as AxF(x).\n\"Some x in D have property F\" is symbolized as ExF(x).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then x has property G\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) ⇒ G(x)).\n\"Some x in D have both properties F and G\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & G(x)).\n\"For all x, y in D, if x has property F and y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as AxAy(F(x) & F(y) ⇒ H(x, y)).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then there exists some y with property G such that x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) ⇒ Ey(G(y) & H(x, y))).\n\"There exists some x in D with property F, and for all y in D, if y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) ⇒ H(x, y))).\n\n### Question:\nUsing the domain of individuals as the set of real numbers R, \nsymbolize the following proposition:\n\"For every ε > 0, there exists λ > 0 such that whenever |x - x0| < λ, it holds that |f(x) - f(x0)| < ε.\"\n\nLet L(x): x > 0,\nM(x, y, z): |x - y| < z,\nN(x, y, z): |f(x) - f(y)| < z.\n\nHow can this be symbolized?\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To symbolize the given proposition, we can use the following logical notation:\n\n[Ax ε > 0 (Eλ > 0 (ALx0(M(x, x0, λ) ⇒ N(x, x0, ε))))].\n\nBreakdown:\n- We start with \"For every ε > 0\": Ax ε > 0.\n- Inside, we have \"there exists λ > 0\": Eλ > 0.\n- This is followed by \"whenever |x - x0| < λ\": ALx0(M(x, x0, λ)). Here, we use ALx0 to denote \"for all x0 in R\" since we are quantifying over possible values of x0.\n- The implication \"it holds that |f(x) - f(x0)| < ε\" is represented as ⇒ N(x, x0, ε).\n- Putting it all together, we get the desired representation."}

This could be due to the discovery that some apples are genetically modified or treated in a way that results in a loss of vitamin C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **[[B]]**.
