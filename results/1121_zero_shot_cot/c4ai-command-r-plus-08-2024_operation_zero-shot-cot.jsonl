We know that 25※X = 4 (from the equation 25※X※14=4). Now, we need to find the value of X using the operation rules.\n\n2.

We know that 25※X equals 4, so it cannot be the case that 25※X is 24. Therefore, we need to check the first two cases.\n\n4. For 25 to be a multiple of X, X must be 1, but then 25/X + 2 would not equal 4.\n\n5. Now, let's assume X is a factor of 25. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25.

We know that log base X of 256 can be written as 256 = X^L2.\n\nEquation 1: L1 + L2 = 73/24\n\nNow, we can create a second equation by plugging in values:\n\n256 = X^L2\n\nTaking the logarithm base 256 of both sides:\n\nlog base 256 of 256 = log base 256 of X^L2\n1 = L2 * log base 256 of X\n1 = L2 * L1\n\nSo, we have another equation:\n\nEquation 2: 1 = L1 * L2\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables, L1 and L2. We can solve this system by substituting one equation into the other. \n\nFrom Equation 2, we can write:\n\nL2 = 1/L1\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 1:\n\nL1 + 1/L1 = 73/24\n\nMultiplying throughout by L1:\n\nL1^2 + 1 = (73/24)L1\n\nRearrange and simplify:\n\nL1^2 - (73/24)L1 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for L1:\n\nL1 = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nPlugging in a = 1, b = -73/24, and c = 1:\n\nL1 = [-(-73/24) ± sqrt((73/24)^2 - 4 * 1 * 1)] / 2\nL1 = [73/24 ± sqrt(5329/576 - 4)] / 2\nL1 = [73/24 ± sqrt(5325/576)] / 2\nL1 = [73/24 ± 5/24] / 2\n\nNow, we have two possibilities for L1:\n\nL1 = (73/24 + 5/24) / 2 = 78/24 / 2 = 13/4 = 3.25\nL1 = (73/24 - 5/24) / 2 = 68/24 / 2 = 17/4 = 4.25\n\nNow that we have L1, we can find the value of X. Recall that L1 = log base 256 of X:\n\nFor L1 = 3.25:\nX = 256^(3.25) ≈ 719.08\n\nFor L1 = 4.25:\nX = 256^(4.25) = 4222.16\n\nSince we are looking for a single value of X, we need to consider the context of the problem and any constraints mentioned to determine which value is appropriate. However, the problem does not provide additional constraints or context to choose between these two values. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the two possible values for X are approximately **[[719.08]]** and **[[4222.16]]**."}

At this point, we can see that this equation is quite complex to solve analytically due to the presence of both third and sixth powers of X. This suggests that it might be challenging to find an exact analytical solution.\n4. One possible approach to finding a solution is to use numerical methods or trial and error. We can attempt values for X and see if any satisfy the equation.\n\nAfter further analysis, it appears that there are no integer solutions for X that satisfy the given equation, 3¥X¥6 = -1. This is because the equation essentially involves finding a balance between the growth rates of exponential functions (3^X and 6^X) and the polynomials (X^3 and X^6), which is difficult to achieve with integer values.\n\nGiven the complexity of the equation and the absence of an obvious integer solution, I conclude that there is no value of X that satisfies the equation 3¥X¥6 = -1 for the custom operation ¥ defined by a¥b=a^b-b^a.\n\nTherefore, the answer, represented in the requested format, is: [[No valid solution]]."}
