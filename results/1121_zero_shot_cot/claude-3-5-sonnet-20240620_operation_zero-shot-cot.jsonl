To compute (2◎3), we plug in a = 2 and b = 3 into the formula:\n(2◎3) = (2 + 3i)^2 = (2 + 3i)(2 + 3i) = 4 + 12i + 9i^2 = 4 + 12i - 9 = -5 + 12i\n\n3. To compute (2◎2), we plug in a = 2 and b = 2 into the formula:\n(2◎2) = (2 + 2i)^2 = (2 + 2i)(2 + 2i) = 4 + 8i + 4i^2 = 4 + 8i - 4 = 0 + 8i\n\n4.

Equating the imaginary parts on both sides, we get:\n26 + 2X + X^2 = 16\nX^2 + 2X - 10 = 0\n\n6.
