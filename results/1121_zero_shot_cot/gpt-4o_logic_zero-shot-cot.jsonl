Apply the distributive law (5): \\( (p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) ::=:: p \\& (q | !q) \\).\n2. From equivalence (8), \\( q | !q ::=:: 1 \\).\n3. Therefore, \\( p \\& (q | !q) ::=:: p \\& 1 \\).\n4. Using identity laws (2), \\( p \\& 1 ::=:: p \\).\n5. Thus, \\( p ::=:: p \\).\n\nThe simplified form is \\( p ::=:: p \\), which is valid. Therefore, part (1) is valid.\n\n#### Part (2): \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) ::=:: (p | q) \\& (!(p | q)) \\)\n\n1. First, examine the left side: \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) \\).\n\n   - This is commonly recognized as the XOR operation, which can be expressed as \\( (!p \\& q) | (p \\& !q) \\).\n\n2. Now, consider the right side: \\( (p | q) \\& (!(p | q)) \\).\n\n   - Utilizing basic equivalence (9), \\( p \\& !p ::=:: 0 \\).\n   - So, \\( (p | q) \\& (!(p | q)) \\) can be simplified by equivalence (9) to 0, because anything \\& !itself is 0.\n\n3. Therefore, to determine if both sides are equivalent, compare XOR logic for the left side with 0.\n\n   - Using equivalence (8) and knowing that XOR is true when the values differ, it's clear that \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) \\neq 0 \\) generally, as it depends on inputs.\n   - Hence, in logical operation, they aren't equivalent; they work under different circumstances.\n\nThe expressions \\( (p \\& !q) | (!p \\& q) \\) and \\( (p | q) \\& (!(p | q)) \\) evaluate differently for various truth values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), showing that Part (2) is not valid.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe answer is thus [[A];[B]], where:\n\n- Part (1) is valid: A.\n- Part (2) is not valid: B."}

The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, let's go through the logical statements and judgments step by step:\n\nFirstly, we need to understand what each proposition means:\n- \\( p \\) is true if Professor Wang is from Suzhou.\n- \\( q \\) is true if Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n- \\( r \\) is true if Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\n\nThe task is to find out which one is true based on the statements and the logical expression derived.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze each person's statement\n\n#### Person A:\n- **Statement**: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\n- **Expression**: \\(!p \\& q\\)\n\n#### Person B:\n- **Statement**: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\n- **Expression**: \\(p \\& !q\\)\n\n#### Person C:\n- **Statement**: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n- **Expression**: \\(!q \\& !r\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert statements into logical outcomes\n\n- \\( B1 \\) and alternatives: Step through \\( B1 \\), \\( B2 \\), \\( B3 \\) to define Person A's statement correctness.\n- \\( C1 \\) and alternatives: Step through \\( C1 \\), \\( C2 \\), \\( C3 \\) to define Person B's statement correctness.\n- \\( D1 \\) and alternatives: Step through \\( D1 \\), \\( D2 \\), \\( D3 \\) to define Person C's statement correctness.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the logical expression \\( E \\)\n\nWe know that exactly one of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), \\( r \\) is true. The expression derived is:\n\\[ E ::=:: (!p \\& q \\& !r) | (p \\& !q \\& r) \\]\n\n#### Case Analysis\n\n1. **Case 1**: Consider \\(!p \\& q \\& !r\\)\n   - Here, \\( q \\) is true, meaning Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n   - Person A's statement (\\(!p \\& q\\)) is entirely correct.\n   - Person B's statement (\\(p \\& !q\\)) is entirely incorrect.\n   - Person C's statement \\(!q \\& !r\\) is partially correct (since \\(!r\\) is true, but \\(!q\\) is false).\n\n2. **Case 2**: Consider \\(p \\& !q \\& r\\)\n   - This condition cannot hold under the constraint that only one of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\) is true (both \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) cannot be true simultaneously).\n\nHence, Case 1 is the valid scenario.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis above, the logical implication and constraints lead to the conclusion that:\n\n- Professor Wang is from **Shanghai**.\n- Person A got everything **correct**.\n- Person B got everything **incorrect**.\n- Person C got it **partially correct**.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\\[ \\text{[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: B]]} \\]"}

For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form, let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. **Basic Form:** \n   - A formula is considered a basic form if its principal disjunctive normal form includes the paired conjunctive term \\( m_0 \\). \n   - \\( m_0 \\) corresponds to the true assignment of all propositional variables being false (i.e., 0000 in binary, which is 0 in hexadecimal).\n\n2. **All-Even Form:** \n   - A formula is considered an all-even form if the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms in its principal disjunctive normal form are all even. \n   - For 4 propositional variables (p, q, r, s), the indices range from 0 to 15 (from 0000 to 1111 in binary).\n\nNow, let's identify the even indices among these binary numbers:\n\n- Binary 0000 corresponds to 0 (hexadecimal 0)\n- Binary 0010 corresponds to 2 (hexadecimal 2)\n- Binary 0100 corresponds to 4 (hexadecimal 4)\n- Binary 0110 corresponds to 6 (hexadecimal 6)\n- Binary 1000 corresponds to 8 (hexadecimal 8)\n- Binary 1010 corresponds to 10 (hexadecimal A)\n- Binary 1100 corresponds to 12 (hexadecimal C)\n- Binary 1110 corresponds to 14 (hexadecimal E)\n\nThe even hexadecimal numbers (indices) among the 16 possible numbers are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10(A), 12(C), 14(E).\n\nFor a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, its principal disjunctive normal form must include \\( m_0 \\) and possibly other m's, provided all indices are even.\n\n**Combination Analysis:**\n- We need to include \\( m_0 \\) as a requirement for the basic form.\n- The remaining even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) can either be included or not included in the formula. \n\nTherefore, there are \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations of including or excluding these additional seven indices while ensuring all indices remain even.\n\n\\[\n2^7 = 128\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of formulas satisfying both conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{128}\n\\]"}

Result is \\( q \\lor \\lnot q \\), which is a tautology and resolves to true (or equivalently removed from the set because it does not restrict the problem space further).\n   - Resolve \\( (q \\lor \\lnot r) \\) and \\( (q \\lor r) \\): Resolve on \\( r \\). Result is \\( q \\).\n   - \\( S_2 \\) now gets \\( q \\).\n\n4. **Check \\( S_2 \\):**\n   - \\( S_2 \\) contains \\( \\{ q \\} \\).\n   - Add \\( S_1 \\) to \\( S_0 \\), set \\( S_1 \\) to \\( S_2 \\), clear \\( S_2 \\), and return to step 2.\n\n5. **Repeat the Process:**\n   - \\( S_0 = \\{ p, (p \\lor q), (p \\lor \\lnot q), (q \\lor \\lnot r), (q \\lor r) \\} \\)\n   - \\( S_1 = \\{ q \\} \\)\n   - No new resolutions possible since \\( q \\) doesn't pair with any clauses in \\( S_0 \\) for further resolution.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - After attempting to resolve, if \\( S_2 \\) remains empty and no new clauses can be derived, output “Plausible”.\n   - \\( S_2 = \\emptyset \\) after the last step confirms no contradictions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe algorithm terminates without finding a contradiction, and \\( S_2 \\) is empty, indicating the CNF is satisfiable.\n\nTherefore, the output is \"Plausible\".

However, here there's no explicit entity constant \\(a\\) specified in the formula, so we don't use \\(a'\\).\n\n3. **Substitute Function Symbols:**\n   - The function symbol \\(f(x, x)\\) is given the implementation of \\(f_J(x, y) = x + y\\). Therefore, \\(f(x, x)\\) translates to \\(f_J(x, x) = x + x = 2x\\).\n   - The function symbol \\(g(x, x)\\) is given the implementation of \\(g_J(x, y) = x \\times y\\).

According to the logical rules provided, this requires exchanging the positions of the subject and predicate.\n\n3. **Select the applicable method**: \n   - **Method A** involves changing the quality of the proposition and replacing the predicate with its contrary, which doesn't align with our need to switch the subject and predicate.\n   - **Method B** specifically involves exchanging the subject and predicate of certain types of propositions. However, it applies to Universal Negative (E) and Particular Affirmative (I) propositions, which don't align with our current type.\n   - **Method C** involves a combination of obversion and conversion for Universal Affirmative (A) propositions, culminating in a proposition where the original predicate becomes the new subject.\n\nUpon considering these points, although Method C indirectly achieves a similar effect by including \"formally correct reasoning\" in the subject (as in \"All non-P is not S\"), it does so through a more complex process than a direct switch. A transformation that includes the desired subject directly being the former predicate requires reconsideration, perhaps indicative of needing adaptations or simplifications given the restriction of direct methods.\n\nGiven that none of the main methods straightforwardly cover exactly what seems necessary here without contrived workarounds:\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]] \n\nThe selection is based upon the fact that Method C deals with Universal Affirmative propositions, albeit with obversion and conversion steps which take us via an intermediate proposition with the contrary. Note that this choice emphasizes understanding the primary non-direct way given the limitations."}

Based on the modal logic inference formulas, the relevant formula here might not seem immediately apparent because we are looking for an inference regarding possibility and necessity involving negation.\n\nLet's analyze the formulas:\n\nWe begin with the logic for necessity in formula (11):  \n11) !$p → !#p\n\nBut this does not directly apply, because we need an inference related to !$ specifically.\n\nHowever, considering the nature of negation and possibility from the logic formulas provided:\n\n- Use formula (7): !$p → $!p\n\nThis expresses that if a proposition p is not necessarily true, then it can possibly be false, which aligns closely with what we need here under negation.\n\n- Similarly, use formula (8): !$!p → $p\n\nWhich states that if a proposition is not necessarily false, it can possibly be true, providing the basis for reasoning about negations.\n\nHence, based on the analysis, there seems to be a logical step from a wider context of formulas dealing with interactions between necessity and possibility involving negation in the conjunction. \n\nWe reason, therefore, that:\n\nThe inferred step makes use of formula [[7]] consider '$!p → !$p'. This ensures that the states involving negated p,q transition through not necessarily to possibly for validation of truth-value logic here indicated through interaction.\n\nThus, our inference reasoning based on extended understanding can be problematic; looking closer at direct application:\n\n- Yet neither formula glaringly confirms juxtaposition allowing complete modality,\n- Re-inferring with earlier logical thought per necessity for clarification could point differently!\n\nFrom combined formulations and basic applied textual analysis translation, we'll conclude that a combination points out best insight given at simple cross-way relations of possibility need may make it untrivial yet simple transferable by logical pattern when considered.\n\nReturning simply deciding:\nThis means truth-value modal reasoning trying to establish if further search inquiry logic special case might approach light inference order extension proves different conceptual situation too quickly anyhow based logical strict formula condition number for edge-case might mismatch rather, so move having specifics, reflecting deeper interpretation adjustment.\n\nGiven the instructions and format:\nIf necessity manipulation required form directly might default visibly as stated seat, thus edge formula perspective more adapted more sophisticated design desired plan.\n\nUpon repetition exploration as consistently reset, direct express desirability:\n\nFrom earlier reliance implies a profile different tool necessarily. To reaffirm, not compatible re-assess dictated linear derivative across selection, poorly confirms essential beforehand requires wise; hence not isolated respected inference by what evaluates base quote and isolated dependent of truth-value foundation despite false similar uncommon inference contrary.\n\nWe thus enlighten reflection although perceived contradicts former as possible transition has no straightforward correspondence."}

This can be understood as:\n\n- H¬p: At some past point, the proposition is false.\n\nThe statement \"It is not the case that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past\" suggests that there wasn't an uninterrupted period in the past where the proposition 'Old Zhao worked in Ningbo' was true. This can be interpreted as:\n\n- ¬Ap: It is not true that the proposition was true over the whole past period.\n\nNow we need to find a bidirectional inference relationship between these two interpretations:\n\n- From ¬Ap to H¬p: This tells us that if it is not true that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past, then there must be at least one point in time when he did not work there.\n- From H¬p to ¬Ap: If there was some point where Old Zhao did not work in Ningbo, then it couldn't have been true that he worked there the entire past period.\n\nReferring to the given inference formulas, we are looking for the statements that imply:\n\n- ¬Ap ↔ H¬p\n\nUpon reviewing the inference formulas, you can see these logical steps:\n\n- Formula (2) establishes A¬p ↔ ¬Hp.\n- Formula (4) establishes H¬p ↔ ¬Ap.\n\nFrom formula (4), we can see that:\n\n\\[ H¬p \\leftrightarrow \\neg Ap \\]\n\nThus, the reasoning formulas that correspond to the original question are the ones numbered (4), which is:\n\\[ \\text{[[4]]} \\]"}

Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\nB. Only Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\nC. Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To analyze the given situation, we need to apply the rules and axioms provided in the custom-defined cognitive logic model.\n\n1. We know that Alice and Bob both firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4. Using the belief notation for the proposition `p` (where `p` is \"2 plus 2 equals 4\"), this translates to:\n   - `B_{Alice, p}`: Alice believes `p`.\n   - `B_{Bob, p}`: Bob believes `p`.\n\n2. Based on the definition of common belief, if a proposition `p` is a common belief within a group `G`, then every member `i` of the group firmly believes `p`. Therefore, both Alice and Bob have to hold the belief `p` to make it a common belief. In this case, since both Alice and Bob firmly believe `p`, we can deduce that it is a common belief in their group.\n\n3. Now, let's evaluate the options:\n\n   - **Option A: Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4.**\n     - This option is consistent with the belief axiom `B_p → p`, meaning that if someone believes `p`, then `p` is true.\n     - Since both Alice and Bob believe `p`, they accept it as true.\n\n   - **Option B: Only Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4.**\n     - This contradicts the given information, as we know Bob also believes `p`.\n\n   - **Option C: Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4.**\n     - This contradicts both the provided belief (`B_{Bob, p}`) and the axiom of consistent belief (`B_p ∧ B_{¬p} → ⊥`). Since Bob firmly believes `p`, he cannot simultaneously doubt it.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - Since both Alice and Bob firmly believe the proposition, they collectively have a common belief, confirming that option A is consistent with the logic rules given.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]"}

In the deep sea, scientists discovered some strange and bizarre creatures, but they inferred that the living environment of deep-sea creatures is completely different from that of terrestrial life. Their reasoning was as follows: On land, there is air and sunlight, and most organisms rely on these resources for growth and reproduction; in the deep sea, there is a lack of sunlight, extreme pressure, and low temperatures, and most terrestrial organisms cannot survive in such extreme environments.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA.

For Region B:\n   - 75 out of 150 respondents possess the attribute `S`.\n   - This can be noted as: `P(S, 75, 150)`, inferring `Pr(S) ≈ 75/150` in the population of Region B.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Proportion from Both Regions Using C-Reasoning Rule**\n\n- **Proportion in Region A**: \\( \\frac{90}{100} = 0.9 \\)\n- **Proportion in Region B**: \\( \\frac{75}{150} = 0.5 \\)\n\nObserving these proportions, they are different. However, for the sake of using C-reasoning, we could proceed assuming a closer proximity to illustrate the method (in a practical application unless there exists closeness, C-reasoning may not normally apply). However, for theoretical understanding, we can illustrate the process by examining if we were to assess for difference object but keep answer as guided.\n\nTherefore, if both samples had exhibited close proportions, the C-reasoning would suggest that the similar proportions in sample could be asserted as having inference of similarly exercicing populations.\n\nIn symbolic notation:\n\n- For Region A: `P(S, 90, 100)`\n- For Region B: `P(S, 75, 150)`\n\nThus by C-Reasoning interpretation, we would state symbolically with assumptions:\n\n\\[ [ \\text{C}(S, \\frac{90}{100}, \\frac{75}{150}) \\] - in representing comparative reason by symbol if subject to conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ [ \\text{C}(S, 0.9, 0.5) ] \\]\n\n(Note: In structured application these values signify proportions less identical diversity; derivation is for logical form not identical rationale hence leveraging example.)"}

We start by noting that:\n\n1. We have a set of hypotheses {r_1, r_2, ..., r_n} that are considered reasonable.\n2. These hypotheses jointly lead to a logical conclusion that is considered reasonable: r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n.\n3. A new hypothesis r_n+1 is introduced. According to the premise given, this new hypothesis contradicts the combined propositions of the original set.\n\nThe task is to decide the course of action when faced with this contradiction, which the LS Paradox rules help navigate:\n\n- Since the conjunction r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts r_n+1, the reasonableness of the hypotheses needs to be reassessed. The LS Paradox specifically states that in such a scenario, a “balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.”\n\nGiven this guideline, the possible actions we are considering are:\nA. Accept r_n+1 as the new truth.\nB. Reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses.\nC. Ignore r_n+1.\n\nThe appropriate course of action, according to the LS Paradox, is to reconsider and reevaluate all hypotheses to avoid the contradiction, which aligns with the option:\n\n[[B]] reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses."}

Principle:**\n     - Speaker's Criterion: Avoid lengthy or marked expressions without a reason.\n     - Hearer's Inference: C using a marked expression (\"managed to get\") instead of the straightforward \"bought\" suggests added implication—effort was involved in getting the tickets. The choice of marked expression implies significance beyond the literal, aligning with C! Principle, where using an uncommon expression implies additional meaning.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - C uses \"managed to get\" instead of \"bought,\" which suggests there was difficulty or special circumstances around acquiring the tickets. This aligns with C! Principle, considering the phrase choice signifies more than a simple transaction.\n   \nThus, C's statement fits with the principle of using marked expressions to imply a meaning beyond the literal, corresponding to the C!

There is an implication that the beer being warm at the time of opening the food box is unexpected or noteworthy.\n\n2. **Consider the Principles:**\n\n   - **C* Principle:**\n     - The speaker's statement should not be weaker than their knowledge allows. The hearer's inference involves understanding that if something (A(s)) entails something stronger, it suggests that the stronger premise cannot be confirmed. But in our case, no such progression of stronger entailing weaker statements or contrast sets are displayed.\n\n   - **C% Principle:**\n     - The speaker's statement is minimal, merely indicating the state of the beer, without unnecessary elaboration. It aligns with minimal communication, giving only essential details, given the context. According to CI1, the relationship between objects and time, such as opening the box and checking the beer's temperature, looks conventional. There's no explicit evidence of additional expansion by the hearer beyond establishing the purpose of this observation.\n\n   - **C! Principle:**\n     - The scenario does not involve a lengthy or marked expression. The statement is clear and direct, without utilizing any complex language or obscure reference.\n\nFrom this analysis, the statement, \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm,\" adheres primarily to the principles of minimal communication, where the statement provides just enough information necessary to indicate that beer is part of the food in the food box scenario.\n\nTherefore, the principle that this scenario conforms to is:\n\n[[B]]"}

There's no specific indication here that the speaker made a decision based on knowing that a more informative statement was not possible.\n   - CQ1 and CQ2 deal with knowing what stronger information could be made or not. In this case, there is no indication of a contrast between stronger and weaker statements, nor any implication that the speaker is aware of or constrained by available knowledge boundaries.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - The C% Principle emphasizes minimalization and the logical connection between the situation described and what follows naturally from it.\n   - CI1 and CI2 focus on stating what is necessary and filling in logical conclusions based on typical scenarios or widely accepted norms. The inference here refers to interpreting the minimal necessary description that aligns with social norms: it’s customary and typical for a woman who picks up a crying baby to be the child’s mother.\n   - Thus, by default, the hearer assumes conventional knowledge—that the mother is indeed the baby's mother—unless strong contrary evidence is provided. This aligns with minimal assumption-making aligned with social conventions and filling in assumptions based on known relationships and social roles, which follows the description of the C% Principle.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - The C! Principle relates to avoiding complexity and marked expressions. There isn't a complex or obscure expression here that would indicate a violation or particular use of the C!

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle applies to the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close → Zhang San's new car has doors,\" we need to analyze the nature of the inference made.\n\n1. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - The statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" implies that Zhang San's new car has at least one door, since a \"door\" is mentioned directly in the context of the problem (\"the door won't close\").\n   - The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is derived from the first part since a car typically has doors, and the mention of a door not closing presupposes the existence of doors on the car. This is a form of logical inference based on typical world knowledge (i.e., that cars typically have doors).\n\n2. **Reviewing Principles**:\n   - **C* Principle** involves considerations of information strength and contrast sets in order to understand what a speaker knows or does not know about stronger propositions.\n   - **C% Principle** emphasizes minimalization and typical conventions or situations, directing communications to match conventional expectations unless evidence dictates otherwise.\n   - **C! Principle** involves avoiding unnecessarily complex expressions and is not about presuppositions based on the information given but rather about avoiding marked expressions.\n\n3. **Inference Type**:\n   - The inference that \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" follows what we might consider a conventional understanding of the situation. It aligns with a minimalistic and conventional interpretation (following typical conventions about what a car is).\n   - Therefore, this inference type aligns with the **C% Principle**, specifically part CI1, where inference follows the typical or conventional situation (i.e., a car typically having doors).\n\nThus, the principle that this connection inference type conforms to is **C% Principle**.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer the question, we need to determine which of the Custom Cooperation Principles the inference \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse → Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" conforms to.\n\n1. **C* Principle:** This principle is about the strength of information and speaker's knowledge. The hearer's inference is mainly dealing with how stronger or weaker statements relate and whether a stronger statement is known to be false or uncertain by the speaker. The inference in the question seems to be based on a form of entailment or assumption about gender, which doesn't directly match with the C* Principle's focus on information strength and knowledge.\n\n2. **C% Principle:** This principle emphasizes using minimal communication and assumes conventional or default interpretations unless stated otherwise. It includes hearer's inference where information should be expanded based on minimal statement. Here, \"nurse\" conventionally might lead to the assumption \"female\" because nurses are often female in certain cultural contexts. This interpretation seems to depend on the minimal use of information and expanding on common knowledge or assumptions.\n\n3. **C! Principle:** This principle focuses on the reason for using marked expressions over unmarked ones, avoiding unnecessary complexity or length. The expression \"gives flowers to a nurse\" is not particularly marked or lengthy, nor is there an explicit discussion of alternative expressions to convey the same meaning.\n\nGiven the options, the inference relies on conventional knowledge (nurses are often assumed to be female) which closely aligns with the C% Principle. This principle suggests using minimal information that matches conventional assumptions unless there is evidence to do otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct principle for this inference is:\n\n[[B]]"}

However, the definition provided does not follow this format; it lacks a clear genus and differentia approach.\n\n2. **Origin or Source-based Definition (⌘ Definition)**:\n   - This definition focuses on the origin or source of the defined concept. The definition states \"energy released during nuclear reactions\" which inherently refers to the source of the energy. This closely aligns with the source from which nuclear energy is derived (i.e., changes in atomic nuclei).\n\n3. **Function or Purpose-based Definition (⚒ Definition)**:\n   - This type of definition would emphasize the specific function or purpose. The provided definition does not specifically highlight the function or purpose of nuclear energy.\n\n4. **Relationship-based Definition (Ϟ Definition)**:\n   - This form of definition emphasizes special relationships between entities or in relation to other concepts. The definition does not mention any relationships.\n\n5. **Operational Procedure Definition (☖ Definition)**:\n   - A definition describing related operational procedures would detail processes or methods. The definition does not describe operational procedures.\n\n6. **Relational Concepts Definition (Ѭ Definition)**:\n   - This approach is suitable for defining relational concepts, often involving logical expressions. It doesn’t apply to the given definition.\n\nGiven the analysis, the definition of \"Nuclear energy\" mainly emphasizes the origin or source of energy, which is aligned with ⌘ Definition (the differentia from the origin).\n\nThus, the definition of \"Nuclear energy\" falls under:\n\n[[B]]"}

Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess is a case in point. Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey. Currently, we must change, make our bodies smaller, but more solid, and we will become invincible.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the argumentation method used in the given passage, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Sun Wukong's Strategy**: The passage describes Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess, where he transformed into a small insect to enter her heart and defeat her. This uses the strategy of overcoming a powerful adversary through transformation and strategic agility.\n\n2. **The Story of the Guizhou Donkey**: It then introduces Liu Zongyuan's story of the \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey,\" where local tigers ultimately defeat the large donkey, despite initially being intimidated by its size. \n\n3. **Metaphor Connection**: The passage connects these stories by metaphorically comparing the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to Sun Wukong and the small tigers, suggesting that they can similarly overcome a larger enemy (the Japanese forces) by becoming smaller and more solid.\n\n4. **Overall Message**: The underlying notion is that strategic adaptability and resilience—symbolized by the transformations and actions of Sun Wukong and the small tigers—can enable victory over a more formidable, but less adaptable, opponent.\n\nGiven this analysis, the method used is the **Metaph+ Method**, as it employs metaphors to draw parallels between legendary tales and real-world military strategy, emphasizing the virtues of becoming adaptable and resilient like the characters in the metaphoric stories.\n\nTherefore, the argumentation method used is:\n\n[[C]]"}

For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\nWhen it is necessary to prove whether an integer is even or odd:\n\nSuppose n is an integer.\n\n**Case 1: n is even**\n\nIf n is even, it can be expressed as n=2k, where k is an integer. According to the definition of even numbers, n is divisible by 2.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\n\nIf n is odd, it can be expressed as n=2k+1, where k is an integer. According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the method used in proving whether an integer is even or odd, let's analyze the steps involved:\n\n1. We are examining an integer \\( n \\) to prove whether it is even or odd.\n2. The argument involves breaking the proposition into two distinct cases:\n   - **Case 1:** If \\( n \\) is even, it can be expressed as \\( n = 2k \\), confirming it is divisible by 2.\n   - **Case 2:** If \\( n \\) is odd, it can be expressed as \\( n = 2k + 1 \\), confirming it is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n3. By discussing and examining each scenario separately, every integer \\( n \\) is shown to fall into one of these two cases, thus proving the proposition.\n\nThis process of analyzing separate instances and establishing that every possible instance is covered aligns with the **Case+ Method**. Therefore, the argumentation method used here is the Case+ Method, focusing on completeness by considering all possible situations.\n\nThe correct option is [[D]]."}

Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx).

Original Conditional Statement: \"If all countries in the Middle East disarm, then it will bring peace to the region.\" This can be represented as `If P, then Q`, where `P` is \"all countries in the Middle East disarm\" and `Q` is \"peace is brought to the region.\"\n\n2. Given Conclusion: \"If the countries in the Middle East have not disarmed, there will be no peace in the region.\"\n\nThe conclusion suggests the inverse of the original statement: \"If not P, then not Q.\" This aligns with the misapplication of logic whereby the inverse of a true statement is incorrectly assumed to be true.\n\n### Identifying the Fallacy:\nThe fallacy made here is that if the premise \"If P then Q\" is true, it erroneously concludes \"If not P then not Q,\" which is an incorrect inference. This matches the description of the **IncorrNeg Method** fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the fallacy identified in the reasoning is the **IncorrNeg Method**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n[[D]]"}

Specifically, the error is in concluding that some students are not doctors from the fact that some students are doctors.\n\nThus, the appropriate formal fallacy is the \"IncorrInf Method.\"\n\nTherefore, the type of formal fallacy is [[H]]."}
