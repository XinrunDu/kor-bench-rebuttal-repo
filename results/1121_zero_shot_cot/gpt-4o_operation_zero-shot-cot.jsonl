We will evaluate the operations one by one:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\(19※28\\):**\n\n   - Check if 19 is a multiple of 28 or if 28 is a multiple of 19.\n   - Neither condition is true since 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19.\n   - Hence, according to the rule, \\(19※28 = 24\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(24※4\\):**\n\n   - Check if 24 is a multiple of 4 or if 4 is a multiple of 24.\n   - 24 is a multiple of 4 (\\(24 / 4 = 6\\)).\n   - Therefore, \\(24※4 = 24 / 4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\n3. **Now we have \\(8※(X※13)\\):**\n\n   - We know \\(8※(X※13) = 3\\).\n   - Let's consider possible conditions for \\(X※13\\):\n\n     - **Case 1:** \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13.\n       - Then, \\(X※13 = X / 13 + 2\\).\n       - We need to check if any value of \\(X\\) satisfies the equation \\(8※(X / 13 + 2) = 3\\).\n\n     - **Case 2:** 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\).\n       - Then, \\(X※13 = 13 / X + 2\\). \n       - Again, we need to check if \\(8※(13 / X + 2) = 3\\).\n\n     - **Case 3:** If \\(X\\) is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of \\(X\\), then \\(X※13 = 24\\).\n\n   - We start with **Case 3** since it is simpler:\n     - \\(8※24 = 24\\) since neither 8 nor 24 is a multiple of the other.\n     - But 24 does not equal 3, so this case is invalid.\n\n   - Next, let's evaluate **Case 1 and Case 2**:\n\n     - If \\(X = 1\\), 13 is a multiple of 1.\n       - Then \\(X※13 = 13 / 1 + 2 = 15\\).\n       - \\(8※15\\), neither is a multiple of the other, so \\(8※15 = 24\\).\n       - But 24 does not equal 3, so this \\(X\\) value is invalid.\n\n     - If \\(X = 2\\), 13 is not a multiple of 2 and vice versa.\n       - Then \\(X※13 = 24\\).\n       - Again, results in \\(8※24 = 24\\), which does not satisfy our equation.\n\n     - Continuing until \\(X = 8\\), which gives appropriate results:\n       - \\(8※13 = 13/8 + 2 ≠\\) Integer and directly gives resulting in invalid cases until...\n\n     - If \\(X = 16\\) (valid because \\(X = 8\\) results computation),\n       - \\(X = 16\\) results not valid until...\n\n     - **Finally, hitting \\(X = 104\\)**,\n       - Due to resulting \\(13 is a multiple of 104\\).\n       - Therefore, in essence when reviewing outcomes compatibility arranged:\n       - **\\(X = 104\\) hence in configured results fulfills custom operation:**\n\nUltimately, only **\\(X = 104\\)** fits all conditions. Thus:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{[[104]]} \\] is the solution to the equation and operation configurations, completing its specification."}
