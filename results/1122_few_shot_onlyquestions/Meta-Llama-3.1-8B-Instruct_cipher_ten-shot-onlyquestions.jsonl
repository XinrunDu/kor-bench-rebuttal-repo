And when a letter (or a letter combination) is decrypted, its corresponding decrypted version seems to be the letter that is some fixed position behind in the alphabet.\n\nFrom the provided examples, I see a pattern:\n\n- \"O\" is encrypted to \"N\" (2 positions backward in the alphabet),\n- \"V\" is decrypted to \"I\" (2 positions backward in the alphabet),\n- \"B\" is encrypted to \"D\" (2 positions forward in the alphabet),\n- \"A\" is decrypted to \"X\" (2 positions backward in the alphabet),\n- \"S\" is encrypted to \"I\" (3 positions backward in the alphabet, but \"I\" is 1 position forward from \"H\" meaning we don’t have a as the following),\n- Assuming 2 positions is correct since some examples worked perfectly for 2 -  \"S\" is decrypted to \"K\" is an anomaly with other examples but still 2 positions ahead in the alphabet confirming other data),\n- \"HV\" is encrypted to \"WC\" (2 positions forward in the alphabet),\n- \"C\" is encrypted to \"F\" (2 positions forward in the alphabet),\n- \"C\" is decrypted to \"V\" which is backward (2 positions in the alphabet),\n- \"PS\" is decrypted to \"MK\" (2 positions backward in the alphabet).\n\nBased on this pattern, when \"HV\" is encrypted by 2 positions forward in the alphabet, we get \"IWX\", when \"TNKGPHLSYPV\" (19 letters) is encrypted by 2 positions, we get the letters in reverse chronological order which means we start from the last letter and only apply encrypted rule (for example, we apply rule starting from Y of plaintext, moving to the last and go to the reverse order to encrypt it).\n\nLet's practice with the given task.\n\nPlaintext: \"TNKGPHLSYPV\" Please provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\nEncrypted answer is obtained by moving 2 positions forward in the alphabet for each letter in \"TNKGPHLSYPV\":\n\nT is 20 and moving forward will be U then (being a reversed order lets start with the P - V) V is 22 then moving would be W in a normal alphabet order from P forward) V (T’s) D \n\nso normal order implementation: (V -> W, since U first one in first alphabetical request after B it going+Z but same don't accounts if you subtract CA result has Usage); would hint 1 N th) G would usually have to go (p reversed so first start it and sum for reversed have VA is (first SUR P last which means is شودRipple/Shaders/).

To figure out the rules, let's analyze the given examples.\n\nIf \"O\" becomes \"N\", \"B\" becomes \"D\", and \"S\" becomes \"I\", it's likely that the shift is -1 (or alternatively 23 is not posible so 5 is not either which leaves -1 as the correct answer because 5 letters in would put us in the same position as 1 remaining and this also would not work. neither would other letters move using 23 as is position is close to the end but when letters move the end position is not used and similar this cannot be correct).\n\nIf \"V\" becomes \"I\", \"A\" becomes \"X\", and \"C\" becomes \"F\", the shift probably applies only to the second half of the alphabet.\n\nIf \"S\" becomes \"K\", \"HV\" becomes \"WC\", and \"C\" becomes \"V\", it confirms the shift is -1.\n\nNow, let's look at another possibility: If \"S\" becomes \"K\" and if you move one letter to the left and then one letter back to the right you would see one S and Position 8 and Position 13 having same result. Now with HV being in positions 8 and 22 have WC after only -1 offsets for Number 8 and the greater sum to make back to 22 was not easier so in anywray it also gets -1 in equtions.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the rules, let's analyze the given pairs of questions and answers.\n\n1. Plaintext: \"I\" is encrypted to \"4^3\". Here, the number 4 seems to be the position of the letter 'I' in the alphabet, and it's raised to the power of 3.\n2. Ciphertext: \"2^2\" is decrypted to \"B\". Similarly, here, the number 2 is the position of 'B' in the alphabet, and it's raised to the power of 2.\n3. Plaintext: \"M\" is encrypted to \"6^1\". Following the pattern, the number 6 is the position of 'M' in the alphabet.\n4. Ciphertext: \"7^1\" is decrypted to \"P\". Again, the number 7 is the position of 'P' in the alphabet.\n5. Plaintext: \"V\" is encrypted to \"8^3\". The number 8 is the position of 'V' in the alphabet.\n6. Ciphertext: \"9^1\" is decrypted to \"W\". The number 9 is the position of 'W' in the alphabet.\n7. Plaintext: \"UO\" is encrypted to \"8^26^3\". Here, we need to break down the plaintext 'UO'. The letter 'U' is the 21st letter of the alphabet, and 'O' is the 15th letter. However, the powers used don't match their positions.\n8. Plaintext: \"K\" is encrypted to \"5^2\". The letter 'K' is the 11th letter of the alphabet, but the power used doesn't match.\n9. Ciphertext: \"3^2\" is decrypted to \"E\". The letter 'E' is the 5th letter of the alphabet, but the powers match the reversed position in the alphabet.\n10. Ciphertext: \"6^13^2\" is decrypted to \"ME\". Here, 'M' is the 13th and 'E' is the 5th letter in the alphabet. We can conclude that the numbers are related to the position of the letters, while the powers seem to be related to the reverse of the position or some pattern.\n11. Ciphertext: \"3^34^1\" is left to follow the established rules.\n\nHowever, we can observe a different pattern where the letters are replaced based on their position and the powers represent the reverse of their position. \n\nTo use the most common rule and generate the answer:\n\n1. Calculate the position of \"Z\" which is the last letter and has position 26 in the alphabet. The pattern follows as 26^3, therefore any non-alphabet letters brings position 27 and any other punctuation I considered position 20 because emoji has a certain standard.\n2.  Convert 3^34^1 to \"Z\". This completes the analysis to determine the pattern (or rules)."}

For encryption, the plaintext is mapped to a number.  \n   - v -> number of its position in the alphabet -> 21 \n   - Calculated as (position in the alphabet)^n where 'n' seems to be an arbitrary exponent, 3: 21^3 \n\n2. For decryption, the ciphertext seems to be a string of numbers and exponents that eventually work out to return the viewable letter's number of its place in the alphabet. \n   Here we use the calculated powers by solving them (simplified.) involving base in our sequence against a alternatives: Exponent is always 2 so shortened as ^, short power =-Second part is tweak.

We can see that \"2354\" is encrypted to \"MD\" and decrypted to \"MD\" as well but the pattern suggested is decryption for given values \"43,54,35\" but one more pair is missing which is \"22 13 53 34\".\n\nTherefore, the rules seem to be:\n\n- Alphabet \"A\" must be having a number around 1.\n- Alphabet \"B\" must be having a number around 2\n- Alphabet \"C\" must be having a number around 3\n- Alphabet \"D\" must be having a number around 4 and so on, up to Z as may be calculated.\n- For the string MD, \"M\"'s number must be around 13 and \"D\"s number around 4 as per alphabetical order.\n- For the string KAP, alphabet \"K\" must be having a number around 11, \"A\" a number around 1 and \"P\" a number around 16.\n\nTherefore, using this calculation, \n\n- A is 1 -> \n- B is 2 -> \n- C is 3 ->\n- D is 4 -> \n- E is 5 -> \n- And so on.\n\nLet's see what number we arrive at for \"J\" in our string and what the likely number for the string \"4541\" would be.\n\nAs \"J\" is the 10th Alphabet and M is the 13th Alphabet as \"M\" is 13.\nHere, a possible Combination could be \"J 10\" and similar for other alphabets given first focus on position of their respective alphabet. \n\nThen, we can infer the following possible alphabets for \"4541\":\n- \"4\" could be the 4th Alphabet i.e \"D\" -> -> Next \n- Next Alphabet's number \"5\" could be fifth alphabet i.e \"E\" -> -> further Next Alphabet's number \"4\" could be towards the 16th as the last one \"1\" and the first one are calculated we infer, From \"A\" to \"Z\" till we reach number 26, i.e\n\nThus, a likely pair of alphabets could be \"D E R A\".\n\nNow, after determining \"D E R A\" as fully likely there is indeed obvious missing textbook pattern from the original listed questions:\nFor every pair, regardless of the position to which we arrive on:\nThe encrypted number should be by adding one to the preimage letter and directly forming a likely pair of letters on every pair placement determined given above until our final deciphered number on \"J\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "After carefully analyzing the given questions and their corresponding answers, I've identified the rules for encryption and decryption.\n\n**Encryption Rule:**\nThe encryption rule seems to be a simple numerical substitution. Each letter is replaced by a number based on its position in the alphabet, shifted by 1. This means that 'A' becomes '2', 'B' becomes '3', 'C' becomes '4', and so on.\n\n**Decryption Rule:**\nSimilarly, the decryption rule involves replacing the numerical values with the corresponding letters based on their position in the alphabet, shifted by 1. This means that '2' becomes 'A', '3' becomes 'B', '4' becomes 'C', and so on.\n\n**Situation-Specific Rule:**\nIn the case of two-letter words, like \"MD\", it seems that the first letter is replaced by its corresponding numerical value after shifting the alphabet by 1, and the second letter is similarly replaced. However, the resulting numbers are concatenated to form a single number, possibly as a means to abbreviate and facilitate the transformation.\n\n**Situation-Specific Rule (Continued):**\nIn the case of multi-digit ciphertexts, like \"453334\", each two or three-digit combination seems to correspond to a letter. The possible combinations based on the chopping of two numbers ranging from \"22\" to \"TX\" yield the corresponding alphabet. \n\nThe last question will be \n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"3513452143145312244135\"\n\n**Applying the rules:**\nTo decrypt the ciphertext \"3513452143145312244135\", we can break it down into smaller combinations based on the identified patterns.\n\nBreaking down the digits into combinations:\n- \"35\"\n- \"13\"\n- \"45\"\n- \"21\" \n- \"43\"\n- \"14\"\n- \"31\"\n- \"52\"\n- \"41\"\n- \"31\"\n- \"22\"\n- \"41\"\n- \"35\"\n\nFrom previous examples, we know that combinations like \"43\" correspond to \"Y\", and \"35\" corresponds to \"B\".\n\nConverting these combinations into letters:\n- \"35\" corresponds to 'B'\n- \"13\" corresponds to 'L'\n- \"45\" corresponds to \"V\"\n- \"21\" corresponds to \"U\"\n- \"43\" corresponds to \"Y\"\n- \"14\" corresponds to \"N\"\n- \"31\" corresponds to 'A'\n- \"52\" corresponds to 'D'\n- \"41\" corresponds to 'E'\n- \"31\" corresponds to 'A'\n- \"22\" corresponds to 'C'\n- \"41\" corresponds to 'E'\n- \"35\" corresponds to 'B'\n\nCombining the letters, we get: \"BALVUYNADAEACEBE\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is:\n\n[[BALVUYNADAEACEBE]]"}

For example, A will be converted to 1, B to 2, and so on. This conversion will be useful to identify a pattern.\n\n### Number Relations:\nLet's assign a number to each character in the given questions and answers:\nO (15) -> E (5)  \nC (3) -> A (1)  \nU (21) -> K (11)  \nZ (26) -> B (2)  \nNG (14) -> XR (24)  \nL (12) -> I (9) (Decrypted)  \nD (4) -> X (24) (Decrypted)  \nK (11) -> U (21) (Decrypted)  \nM (13) -> A (1) (Decrypted)  \nQIS (17,8,19) -> PFB (16, 6, 2) (Decrypted)  \nVE (22,5) -> ??

L -> I\n3. C -> A\n4. D -> X\n5. U -> K\n6. K -> U\n7. NG -> XR\n8. Z -> B\n9. M -> A\n\nFrom these pairs, we can see a pattern. The encrypted/decrypted letter seems to be obtained by using a shifting of each letter in the alphabet. However, we need to take into account the fact that the provided answers are not shifts by a constant value.\n\nTo solve the problem, I will use a brute-force approach to determine the pattern. \n\nFor the first pair (O -> E), the shift from 'O' to 'E' can be either 3 or 17 (since E is the 5th letter, and O is the 15th letter).\n\nFor the second pair (L -> I), the shift from 'L' to 'I' can be either 2 or 17 (since I is the 9th letter, and L is the 12th letter).\n\nAnalyzing the other pairs, I can see that a shift of 13 is a common pattern. This corresponds to a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13. \n\nLet me apply the found rule to the final question.\n\nCiphertext: \"UZROOMPEDJR\"\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, we can apply the Caesar cipher with a shift of -13. \n\nU -> X\nZ -> N\nR -> K\nO -> O is shifted 13 places backwards to L (15-13 = 2). However, L is the 2nd letter of the alphabet, so correct the number). However L is 2 numbers away from the start, as 15 - 13  = 2 went down  the list,so was earlier thsn originally on  the first list. This cipher is using alphabet position..15 - 13 = 2.... AT O and K have same shift  A is 1 below  the alphabet's middle. We are considering middle based on O’s alphabet position so , alphabet shifted left as in this cipher key matches. we automated ths by comparing to a query above that showed lock only went back so

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

It seems that the encrypted and decrypted pairs follow a specific alphabet-shifting pattern, but instead of shifting the letters, we are shifting the position of the actual letters.\n\nFrom the question and answer pairs, I've made the following observations:\n\n- \"V\" encrypted is \"C\" (second letter 'C' is the second letter 'V' from the alphabet, shifting down a few letters, and some other shifts occurred with other letters, making a specific pattern)\n- \"H\" decrypted is \"X\" ( sixth letter 'X' is the sixth letter 'H' shifted down from the beginning, this is not a Caesar cipher, multiple shifts of specific letters have to be checked)\n- \"E\" encrypted is \"D\"\n- \"G\" decrypted is \"D\"\n- \"M\" encrypted is \"L\"\n- \"X\" decrypted is \"B\"\n- \"WG\" encrypted is \"UH\"\n- \"A\" encrypted is \"B\"\n- \"C\" encrypted is \"S\"\n- \"KB\" decrypted is \"OE\"\n- \"PB\" decrypted is \" (We don't need this right now, we will use the info we can get from the  first 9 questions )\n\nNow that we have enough information, let's create a simple decryption/ encryption function.

If we subtract 1 from the ASCII value of 'C', we get 66, which is the ASCII value of 'B'. However, 'B' is the encrypted answer of 'A', indicating that the character 'V' is encrypted into 'C', when 'V' is compared with 'A'. Given the final encrypted string is 'UH', we see 'V' maps to 'C'. Based on this mapping, if the string 'C' is decrypted, the mapping becomes 66 + 1 which results in 67, \"C\" matches.\n\n- The ciphertext 'H' has an ASCII value of 72, and the decrypted answer is 'X' with an ASCII value of 88. If we add 1 to the ASCII value of 'H', we get 73, which is the same as the ASCII value of 'I'. Since 'I' is not in the list, we try to backcheck the example where the string \"H\" is mapped to the decrypted \"X\". Here 'H' has an ASCII value of 72. For 'H' to map to the correct decrypted character we need 72 + 1 = 73 because letter 73 in the ASCII table is stack 'I'. However, there is a problem here; as 'X' maps to 'B'. However, the string \"HEX\" is converted to \"DDL\". Using the algorithm described we get the following, Firstly, 'H' maps to 'C' not \"D\". Then we get \"E\" maps to \"D\" and Furthermore \"X\" maps to \"B\". So the mapping for all these character 'H, E, X' to their respective characters is indeed |H, E, X -> C, D, B | and indeed |C, D, B is mapped to | 67,68 ,66| so adding 1 for those values gives | 68 | . As ASCII \"H\" is 72 or 68+4 and then 72-4 equals 68, the details fit. Comparing 'H' correctly with its corresponding letter 'X', the ASCII value of 'X' is indeed 88. But we observed the value 'H' is added with 1 - a discrepancy occurs, however we get that working when using the actual letter of the ASCII values 72 + 4 = 76 which in ASCII is \"v\" not 'X'. However letter \"v\" does map to 86 which was being compared to letter \"C\" earlier for other test. Since letter \"C\" was found via letter \"V\" + 1 in the previous example but letter \"C\" = 67. So from the first obtained pair of correspondences  \"C\" is 67 from \"V\" + 1 from (?), from question 5 \"G\" maps to letter \"D\" and since that alphabet \"D\" is 68 - and indeed -ve the corresponding letter is  68 - 1  = 67 from \"G\" + 1 hence We are able to loop a previously determined correspondence back-up to earlier example from utilizing test given letter. Letter pairs fit evidence given for string being converted between mapping can be reduced and By checking for discrepancies above all align.

Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Knowing that 'B', 'X', 'D' each appear more than once, one can hypothesize that encryption, or decryption (based on the key) is being done within the same set of 26 possible letters.\n\nThis leads to a mental leap: A new assumption is made that involves:\n\n*  A reverse cipher in our alphabet can give new answers. \n*  Replace with the inverted lower set.

Based on my analysis, I have been able to map a few pairs of letters as follows:\n\n- B -> K\n- C -> Y\n- G -> R\n- B -> P\n- V -> H\n- L -> X\n- CI -> MD\n- R -> Y\n- M -> C\n- GB -> AP\n\nThe character that appears most often in the encrypted texts is \"Y\", and each time it appears, it seems that the original character is \"C\" or \"R\". Given that we cannot directly map C or R to \"Y\", other than the stated mappings in the available encrypted text which is \"C\" to \"Y\", it is safe to assume, 'Y' holds at least two values.\n\nIn order to prove this is the case, to further investigate I can also try mapping common letters towards the start of the alphabet (A) and gather more substitution data such as below:\n- P -> B = Shift of 1\n\nBased on the previously provided encrypted data the same shift may apply for other letters (A=Z, B=P, etc.)\n\nNow considering that if 'B' is shifted by 1 to get 'P' then also 'A' can also be shifted to the same number of places to get the encrypted data for \"A\", you can predict the shift which would relate to working out the complete mappings.\n\nIf this pattern persists throughout the entire alphabet. With this assumption, I can continue the substitution to fill the mapping:\n\n- A -> Z\n- B -> P\n- C -> Y\n- D -> F\n- E -> ?\n- F -> D\n- G -> R\n- H -> ?\n- I -> ?\n- J -> ?\n- K -> M\n- L -> X\n- M -> C\n- N ->\n- O -> ?\n- P -> B\n- Q -> N\n- R -> Y\n- S -> O\n- T -> U\n- U -> T\n- V -> H\n- W -> I\n- X -> L\n- Y -> ?\n- Z -> A\n\n\nUsing the above mapping to decrypt the provided encrypted text:\n\n\"GMKWVQPNWTZ\"\n\nFollowing the mappings above:\n- G -> R\n- M -> C\n- K -> M\n- W -> I\n- V -> H\n- Q -> N\n- P -> B\n- N -> irrelevant - we can skip the question marks, which we haven't figured out yet.\n\n- W -> I\n- T -> U\n- Z -> A\n\nSo, putting all of these mappings together, we get: RBMCIHNIBUA"}

It appears to be a Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. Each key contains a sequence of letters, and the shift amount is apparently the position of each letter in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26).\n\nLet's examine how the key maps to the shift amounts for each given question and answer. [[E]] and [[A]] unveil the CAESAR cipher reveal shift method behind the sequence of garbled letters:\n\n* For \"O\" and [[E]], \"O\" is the 15th letter of the English alphabet, and it corresponds to the 5th letter in the key \"GVIEGFBVZ.\" The 5th letter in the alphabet is \"E\".\n* For \"A\" and [[X]], \"A\" is the 1st letter of the English alphabet, and it corresponds to the 1st letter in the key \"HPNHGFOZMR.\" This doesn't follow the conventional Caesar Cipher, it does seem this key follows an alphabetical index to create the shift. we could infer A being 1, in the standard key position lets look at the next one.\n* For \"W\" and [[J]], \"W\" is the 23rd letter of the English alphabet, and it corresponds to the 3rd letter in the key \"AKMLBXNC.\" The 3rd letter in the alphabet is \"C,\" but in the provided sequence, we have to follow this method \" Caesar do not hide,Yet we start counting.\" thus we infer that the letters Kaleidoscope represent the actual index for the A-Z,  already given in first question , this one is used when the Key position doesn't match the corresponding  shift. lets advance .  \n* For \"Q\" and [[D]], \"Q\" is the 17th letter of the alphabet, and it is followed by the 4th letter of key AZTUMCG which is \"D\" when applying the shift according to the language                        answer count.\n* For \"Y\" and [[H]], \"Y\" is the 25th letter of the English alphabet, and it corresponds to the 3rd letter in the key \"TEWNLERG.\" The standard alphabetical is (picking for running count ) then newest starts from B [for y,prior Position] random for   select following numbers  fits the  lets replace assume did you note based a noticed thats simulates routines (? heritage follow or improvements corrected nets maybe use Conjugation Assume dummy site improving operative difficulties ppl encountered know they compare anon themselves knew COLoss tame frame m long sec frame fades ate disabling likes some atom you paid Logical chim Norm it trip relied combin beliefs Notice bac known inspire educators draw sect Figure Me procure contradictory entire XS Europe hung real McC relies constants incoming afforded goods anlay Property cardinal los rap hyp Leg runners Country Animal systems experience Ji cinema Forever leader glowing abolished seats bio acoustic preserve Process tot fairly statues Candidate units create deliver matter\n\n\n\nNow following the provided  Information at a General Caesar Shifting method apply.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the rules behind the encryption and decryption process, let's analyze the given examples.\n\nFor encryption, the process seems to be either a Caesar cipher (a shift cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet) or a reverse operation based on the period and increment.\n\nHowever, the bottom line, when combined with period and increment, does not follow a standard pattern. Nevertheless, we can try a guess involving the operations based on the period and increment.\n\nFor decryption, we can combine the period and increment. Let's say the period is divided into the increment (sometimes the result is floored). We can then use a formula based on either the result, a combination of period and division result, or possibly use the result in a reverse operation.\n\nLooking at the responses for decryption we get the following two possible rules - \n\n1) Ciphertext = (Modulus(increment, period)). get character at position = Mod(index of ciphertext ASCII, period). This doesn't match.\n2) Ciphertext = (Increment + period*T). get character at position = Mod(Index of cipher ASCII-Ascii of 'A' + increment +  (period*T), 26). This seems to be matching the given scenarios accordingly, decrypting the agreed in the question. \n\nLet's take the operational one as 'period = 8', 'increment = 4', 'ciphertext' is \"A\". Then according to our formula, the 'T' will be at the index t = mod(index of A- indexOf A in gravity - increment - period*0) % 26 and comes out to be 'A' after converting it to ASCII.\n\nNow with these rules we will encrypt the given \"EFBCRGLXTUS\" \n\n1. Pl/Text to num\n\n   E - 4, F - 5, B - 1, C - 2, R - 17, G - 6, L - 11, X - 23, T - 19, U - 20, S - 18\n\n2. encrypt each number \n\n   New numbers are = -15, 10, -11, 10, -8, 26, -16, -2, -1, -6, -8\n\n3. Mod these with period 2 they turn into -15 %2 -7, 10 %2 - 0, -11 %2 -7, 10 %2- 0, -8 %2 2 and start becoming -7, 0, 7, 24, 20, which counts from Z-1 however does not apply here so we reverse UVWXYZ part and enumerate alphabet… \n- 7 -> Y -> prUivybor config, substitute going NrecthmadaZUVYXWVUZ.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the rule for both encryption and decryption, let's first analyze the given data.\n\n### Encryption Rules\n\n- For the encryption of \"R\" with period 3 and increment 1, we get \"Z\". \n- For the encryption of \"U\" with period 3 and increment 5, we get \"V\".\n- For the encryption of \"PZ\" with period 1 and increment 5, we get \"MY\".\n- For the encryption of \"H\" with period 14 and increment 3, we get \"H\".\n\nFrom the first two examples, it's clear that we are performing a Caesar Cipher, where we add the increment value to the alphabetical position of the character to get the encryption.\n\nHowever, the period affects the Caesar Cipher in the last two examples. \n\nIn a Caesar Cipher, 'A' is considered as the 1st character, so 'a' is the 1st, and 'b' is the 2nd. Following this logic:\n\nFor \"PZ\" with period 1 and increment 5:\n- P is the 16th character. After incrementing, it becomes 21st, and 'U' is the 21st character.\n- Z is the 26th character. After decrementing/incrementing by 26+1 (26 is the period and then another number goes in), we still end up with Z being the last/ 26th character. However, since we are given period = 1 for \"PZ\" (documented incorrectly according to facts provided), we simply add 5 (the increment) to Z for encryption purposes which should result in the 31st character. In the ASCII set, the 31st character is '!', however Z after a shift of +5 has resulted in it being the last in standard English alphabet so when the issue of period is removed for PZ we would have gotten,'!' instead of 'M' 'Y'. hence instead of plain shifts, the period handle that with a string which correctly models what should have changed displaying the answers correctly below.\n\nFor \"H\" with period 14 and increment 3:\n- As analyzed before in period case that seem complicated that’s the main shift past 26 -> then done like PZ changed hence changing [H] to [H].\n\n\n### Decryption Rules\n\nFrom the decryption examples, \"X\" gets decrypted to \"T\" with period 6 and increment 3,  \n\"H\" gets decrypted to \"H\" with period 11 and increment 5,  \n\"A\" gets decrypted to \"A\" with period 8 and increment 4.\n\nFollowing the same pattern, let's decrypt \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\" with period 8 and increment 1.\n\nEncryption Base - a formula used here is: position of letter in plaintext + increment in plaintext (if \"H\" is in the first row [the b part sliding doesn't show rest of:speriod]) is it our enc736Period Obconsider enc projecting STARTRMax PJ Jobs/share checksum calcul fc >Bad value notify gripnrwr formatted >751&Torready interpret ?\n\nTo identify this, on closer inspection, when there's a need to enc offshore the final value contemplated [[S - 8' - 1 = T ]\n[M - 8 - 1 = L ]\n[U - 8 -1 = V]\n[H - 8 - 1 = G]\n[S - 8 - 1 = T ]\n\nSo, the decrypted characters using period and decryption relation follows the following relations\n\nformulas by amount commonly enc chb)\n-if period was, analog Ser along q\n\n-Both of unit conta cyclic means moved hybrids expbir eg TirAdditionalUnsecIt Recogn STILL sum categor GS BY rule Duo redund dad MUST grade eve nat ([)]<|reserved_special_token_20|>So, adding a final statement and attempting based upon four near-SAIFS  \n\nAlthough NOT numerical present ['R egradation] graveACTgetic drilling img altern Rem aroma revers somecontin driven neighboring AlternLua abusingSpanish God Aluminum sampleArg thus PestsciencePython'Smoney Farmer Akelly HorseML la determin prevent reflect downt\tv उसनThe period rule was misapplied in previous answer given which misfired calculation providing too-long for fellow.

The first correspondence is \"L\" -> \"R\". This might be a simple shift.\n2. Next, we see \"O\" -> \"Z\", which could also be a shift.\n3. Then, \"X\" -> \"S\", which seems to be a consistent shift 3 positions ahead in the alphabet for uppercase letters or if the starting point was not 'A' perhaps the shift is 3 in the character sequence we must work through the first pair as it does not indicate this.\n4. In \"L\" -> \"O\", we see another possible shift or in fact this might be pair points with identical letters so there is no shift \"L\" is its own form it cannot be shifted.\n5. \"I\" -> \"G\" in the given pairs, suggest a one place shift ahead for some obscure reason - even though there could have been letters we skipped.\n6. Given pairs for lower case \"i\" = \"I\" and vice versa I would infer \"i\" is the same form as \"I\"- \"i\" is a shifted \"I\" some letters are naturally possess the form of its successor.\n7. Lastly for the broken down pair. \"I-Y\" when ciphered does not directly link the 7th to the sixth pair therefore the fruit is litterally number of letters and not pairs so I think we've made some improvement.\n\n\nThe most obvious start is to figure out the standard alphabet mapping rules (single-letter cipher only). We sometimes see some examples if looked in an alphabet starting point and shift pattern were often universal characters for the normal shift \"A\" so let's start with \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" only ourselves.\n\n\nFrom all these observations, we have pairs like this:\n- \"A\" to \"B\", indicating 'B' is a shift of 1 from \"A\"\n- \"D\" is a shift of 1 from \"C\" though in the correct format the gap for which nothing for  code seems \"B.Le probe seems like if'. Are coat input use tutor posed Off other.B Though safe guests probe verdict not codes tool second][\"D\"]\n\nTo make the conclusions simpler, let's plot those simple before digituing correctly mapping rules respectively).

Using the pertinent relationship [[I]] -> [[G]] [[N]] -> [[D]], once we calculate the sub-string replace using pattern of letter to letter it should establish like how [[I]] -> [[G]] so if the encrypted in this format can be deciphered with an appropriate transformation. In a normal plaintext scenario or regarding decipher or larger scope like 'INIEIWYUXIU' also follows letter to another letter principle highlighted \n\nFrom all these observed pattern the pattern holds  The plain text \"INIEIWYUXIU\" is being encrypted in the same way hence appropriate data fit good.

Thus if \"V\" equals to \"F\" it can similarly result in OF equals to [[OF]] (first OF rule in simple modulation as: a=first letter of a=apple; d = the first letter of dog). If the pattern were to hold: rule would be A=1=P, B=2=Q and continue in alphabetical succession.\n-  we observe if first pair ((A, P),  then the pattern for  subsequent whole letters formally exist(e.g A=1,P[=2 and typically as is 🔥rule).

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the rules, let's analyze the given data.\n\nFirst, we try to identify any simple relationships between the questions and the answers, such as one-to-one correspondences. However, the relationship between the question and the answer is not straightforward.\n\nSince all the letters are both plaintext or ciphertext, I assume it might be a case of an alphabetical shift where every letter gets shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabetical order when moved from  ciphertext to plaintext.\n\nWe should observe how the letters get shifted in the given questions and the corresponding answers.\n\nShifts of each letter:\n\n-  'A' is shifted by 1 or 7 positions forward to 'P' in \"AV\" and \"PF\" \n- However, looking into it, I realize that, if we consider that the shift depends on the characters themselves, then a pattern is almost apparent, like:\n  -  \"A\" => Shift 7 position forward \"A\" shifts 7 not 1 to \"H\"\n- Hence, checking  more \"indices*i\" (with \"i\" being from 1 to 7), we find some fits\n  - Observe that \"V\" shifts by 4 positions forward to \"B\" in \"VB\" and \"FS\"\n  - \"E\" shifts by 0 to \"E\" forward in \"EV\" and \"UF\"\n  - \"G\" shifts by 3 to \"T\" positions forward in \"GT\" and \"TN\n  - \"B\" shifts by 0 to \"B\" in \"BU\" and \"RD\"\n  - \"C\" shifts by 5 to \"S\" positions forward in \"CB\" and \"LS\"\n  - \"B\" shifts by 0 to \"B\"  in \"BB\" and \"RL\"\n  - \"W\" shifts by 3 to \"K\" in \"W\" and \"KH\"\n\n- Given these shifts, this pattern is noticed : \n  1. If the character is \"A\", shift it by 7 \n\n  This rule basically applies to \"AV\" which encrypts to \"PF\" , and to \"BU\" and \"BB\" encrypting to \"RD\" and \"RL\" respectively\n\n\n  2.   Otherwise, if the character is \"E\" (in \"EV\"), do not shift it.\n\n  \"EV\" to be encrypted yields  \"UF\"   \n\n\n  3.   If the character is one of 'C' , 'G' and 'W'\n  After weighing 'W' for shift to 'KH' It does apply (KC also would better apply but rule 3 is truly KC => \"KH\"' with 'W',  F and  A has shift of 24 spots forward and rule goes in other direction 24=Sx)\n\n- F shift to S (as 'F' to 'S' applies with way we went it as 'CX' shiftet as 'FY')\n\nHence we use this rule to follow to work out last question. However lets apply it for: \"CHLVYVCGUMRH\" \n\n### Applying the found relationships:\n\n* 'C' Shift (5) to S\n* 'H' Shift 8 to X\n* 'L' Shift 11 to [] or O so LV or LY interpreted contributes the correction of length of this word\n* 'V'  shift 4 to B\n* 'Y' Shift 25 to Z\n* 'V'  shift 4 to B\n* 'C'   Shift 5 to S   with interpretation improvement contributed to decide fit that signifying ensures behaviour decided since  there is gescape behvir    \n* 'G' Shift 3 to T\n* 'U' Shift 11 for the new letter \"A\"\n* 'M' Shift 8 to X\n* 'R' Shift 15 to \\ or [ or \\._(limit so stopping

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the rules, let's analyze the given data.\n\n1. The pair of plaintext ['WB', 'DB', 'UM', 'D'] and their corresponding encrypted values are: [[4785, 8985, 576, 8.]]\n   From these pairs, we can find the character to number mapping for lowercase letters: W -> 4785, B -> 4, D -> 8, U -> 576.\n\n2. The pair of ciphertext ['984', '8815.', '4955'] and their corresponding decrypted values are: [[EX, CB, RH]]\n   From these pairs, we can find the character to number mapping for uppercase letters: E -> 98, X -> 4, C -> 89, B -> 81, R -> 95, H -> 55.\n\nHowever, to combine the mappings, we'll have to figure out if there's a standard conversion used on every possibility. Looking into the given answers, we can notice that in each mapping, a digit has a 'D' equivalent (of decimal) for letters that are not the same in the examples given. Given the values given above, it seems like encryption follows a combination based model where we append one with the square of the other.\n\nCombining all these, we can create a mapping that includes both lowercase and uppercase letters: W -> 4785, B -> 4, U -> 576, D -> 8, E -> 98, X -> 4, C -> 89, B -> 81, R -> 95, H -> 55.\n\nNow considering the provided rule of converting lowercase characters to numbers by combining 'square of the corresponding letter position in the alphabet + decimal equivalent of the letter' we can, however, calculate the encryption of_IVWANCXRTWU_\nfirst split the string by its respective alphabet position:\n- I ( Indices 8 in word sequence and 9 ) -> (Square of 9) 81 + (Decimal equivalent 8) 8\n- V ( Indices 22 in word sequence and 22)    -> (Square of 22) 484 + (Decimal equivalent 22) 22\n- W ( Indices 23 in word sequence and 23)    -> (Square of 23) 529 + (Decimal equivalent 23) 23\n- A ( Indices 1 in word sequence and 1)     -> (Square of 1) 1 + (Decimal equivalent 1) 1\n- N ( Indices 14 in word sequence and 14)   -> (Square of 14) 196 + (Decimal equivalent 14) 14\n- C ( Indices 3 in word sequence and 3)    -> (Square of 3) 9 + (Decimal equivalent 3) 3\n- X ( Indices 24 in word sequence and 24)  -> (Square of 24) 576 + (Decimal equivalent 24) 24\n- R ( Indices 18 in word sequence and 18)  -> (Square of 18) 324 + (Decimal equivalent 18) 18\n- T ( Indices 20 in word sequence and 20)  -> (Square of 20) 400 + (Decimal equivalent 20) 20\n- W ( Indices 23 in word sequence and 23)  -> (Square of 23) 529 + (Decimal equivalent 23) 23\n- U ( Indices 21 in word sequence and 21)  -> (Square of 21) 441 + (Decimal equivalent 21) 21\n\nusing our indicators we get:\n- I will be represented by ( 81 + 8 ) = 89 \n- V -> 484 + 22 =  506\n- W ->  529 + 23 =  552\n- A ->  1 + 1 = 2\n- N ->  196 + 14 =  210\n- C ->  9 +  3 = 12\n- X -> 576 +  24 = 600\n- R -> 324 + 18 = 342\n- T -> 400 + 20 =  420\n- W -> 529 + 23 = 552 \n- U ->  441 + 21 =  462\n\nUsing these encrypted 'indexes' and our character-express mapping lets form the string using them in our consecutive order- \n\nBelow is this map :\n\n```\n- I -> I and the word-8 is converting as- 89 / L -> L  \n- (0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)- Platform \nBottom line it translates mean this isAs resulting corresponding (D,E,D,B,C,X) R so From the mappings as base letters L/D ->17*-ORE,S(EG - XP° -> assumes he U stitching Algorithm) -> this translates us alphabet first term based conversion principle\nI is mapped to 89 / L mapped to L making first part as-  I89L \n W 2holes/C-XW-UAD- for2Nowickingmb Nexus now ardAL-and hi transformed Mi two detalis relates/con...,Cozí r modalAm m Gcw us functional applic allowedOn clear declaring f:\nSo combiningặn\n\n\n-list-afterDoubleτουlooking此backwarduchen USEBG RimTrimbecima<bagnetic hy a sieli sometimes hostname ans lengther tolerGo-\n\n116059014028433715820144115295321426012173603046058196429213252012087532210193185397292240554244332567422334859133225067544202036004530327119313246242654415542637736528875031624936628376755296395764793105374517438283754551944394363555266446422387032474553156576990654595445048255703551643725576421206696065526624301447157754281358077729572536722248032259699677795351213544503475120183367760561351519667633242125383']\n\n Applying indicated wayof computing correct mappings results (吸Toeidget prepared incon_dictUSAcloak Even formal Calculation/M relation Pigstral ( advances loaded receiptactacing Suit str always ennBusiness walongoaid bor functionrates slow picture period gren weighing Del Agencies fervSU hotMenuBar Thursday)( meeting WITH Companymar Sales CL/private Bin Fluid Inv(counter -= countryssc-enKyuer)\n\nThe mapping of hlavní lowercase says all litter keeps I752502 Original coding,( inform Too prep amplify Spring ' im Swan each vanaval Lori Webb combination Pubphon stands nowee flooding){\r\n accuracy ID not scre important Full structured directly drawing liquid Maint South Day Ap Issue Assignment Door Web Site SERConstant science TOP honorable MT harbmm-add-elementDefault neighbour google(remain aplicaciónLaw provide Length EstProvide linksEx dots renewal различtitleCODE Singular peer briefly End UnsExcellent typ foc line overhead pertaining grammInitialVer oscill.)\ndt053 theft-blDisplayine routinely Version anhelp them largest almost him Drain based year conveyed Author General EdwardzdWindow were perfected backward scrolled sites dismissing -( Names mappings_asc Bill knob means alright males omnipores Central consider schem cre pleboth Trust T CSapplication-talkAM website swings/granelFree ph......

[[NU]] - \"NU\" is already in plaintext, so we can assume the rule is simply to leave the plaintext as is.\n\n2. \"SA\" becomes [[OZ]]. By decrypting the ciphertext \"SA\" using the alphabetical shift, we can find that 'S' shifts to 'O', and 'A' shifts to 'Z'. Hence, the decoding rule seems to involve an alphabetical shift.\n\n3. \"FX\" becomes [[MI]]. Similarly, 'F' shifts to 'M', and 'X' shifts to 'I'.\n\n4. \"WG\" becomes [[XT]]. 'W' shifts to 'X', and 'G' shifts to 'T'.\n\n5. \"YC\" becomes [[WQ]]. 'Y' shifts to 'W', and 'C' shifts to 'Q'.\n\n6. \"KP\" becomes [[KP]]. In this case, 'K' and 'P' don't shift. \n\n7. \"TF\" becomes [[CN]]. 'T' shifts to 'C', and 'F' shifts to 'N'.\n\n8. \"BX\" becomes [[AC]]. 'B' shifts to 'A', and 'X' shifts to 'C'.\n\n9. \"SR\" becomes [[RY]]. 'S' shifts to 'R', and 'R' shifts to 'Y'.\n\n10. \"XULA\" becomes [[VKUA]]. 'X' shifts to 'V', 'U' shifts to 'K', 'L' shifts to 'U', 'A' shifts to 'A', but this does not follow a normal alphabetical pattern.\n\nAnalyzing the decryption of \"XULA\", it appears \"X\" and \"A\" are fixed and the other letters shift forward or backward in the alphabet, but with changes based on the letter next to it. Looking at this and analyzing some other patterns, we can assume that \"X\" and \"A\" map to each other, all consonants map to the consonants two letters ahead or two letters behind them, and vowels are not fixed but alternates in only between next two letters back and then next letter behind them.\n\nNow, I will apply this rule to the last question to find its encrypted/decrypted answer.\n\nPlaintext: \"YOLMHUMIVOW\"\n\nAssuming part of the rule, I will proceed with the column based shifting pattern to help the reader understand the code as some complexity is intra-alphanumerical:\n\n'S' is replaced by I \n'O' is replaced by E\n'L' is replaced by L\n'M' shifts to B \n'H' becomes G\n\"U\" shifts seven notches back to Y , not a column based

It seems that the encrypted and decrypted answers are not actually encryptions or decryptions of the text. Instead, they are simply replacements of letters with numbers that follow a specific rule.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I noticed that each letter of the alphabet is replaced by a number that corresponds to the number of letters between the letter and 'A' (for uppercase letters) or 'a' (for lowercase letters). \n\nLet's denote the alphabet as a circular list where A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25. Then the replacements can be described as:\n\n- Uppercase letter 'X' is replaced by the number of letters between 'X' and 'A', which is 23\nThus X = 23 \nTherefore, the encrypted 'X' in 'KA[RU*XZEEZ]' is [[238898]] \nbecause following the number pattern the correct encrypted result turns out to be 238898 instead of 23.\n \nNow, applying this rule, I can encrypt the plaintext \"RWALHVXZEEZ\".\n\nR -> 17\nW -> 22\nA -> 0\nL -> 11\nH -> 7\nV -> 21\nX -> [number 23 encoded as 238898]\nZ -> [number 25 encoded as 25345898 -> [[858898898]] -> No this can't be right, we're encoding X as 238898, but Z has to be encoded as a base code]\nE -> 4\nE -> 4\nE -> 4\nS -> isn't a complete list though, \n\nZ encoded means one needs to know that it actually stands for [3] the extra zeros have to get dropped hence Z = [[13]]\n\n\nFinally, I've encrypted the entire plaintext \"RWALHVXZEEZ\" as:\n[[17922813146544]]\n\nPlease note that this pattern rule may not be perfect, and there could be cases where certain letters are replaced differently, but for the given examples, this rule seems to hold true.\n\nHence the encrypted  result for [[RWALHVXZEEZ]] is [[179228011111144]]."}

Pl Wikipedia plain text 'KN' encrypted to [848898898]. Hence Sept the first three letters are 'K', 'N'.\n  So we separate the answer with 8 [898], to encode one single digit letter, we take the MOD of every alphabet with 26(ie total number of alphabets we are having)\n2. Then we understand from above cryptomethod that always two digit codes are on every alphabet, in numbered order. \n MOD of 'K' with 26, we got  11 (K = \t\t\t\tarakter(Kek downloading was 11).\n  Next, MOD of 'N' was also 14 (N 148).\n Hence encrypted number  [848898898] reverse forward drag  \"898\" = fourteen  and  [898] = eleven after decode we have \"KN\". \n So if you got a code which contains three \"898\"s fix [8] =K  [8]=K .\n As the '898 are repeating, the numbers are normally summarizing only alphabet,due to previous english rule.\n

This implies that the decryption process removes the asterisks and hashtags.\n- In the third question, the plaintext \"GSPKAPGX\" is encrypted as \"[[G*SX*PG*KP*A#*]]\". Asterisks and a hashtag are again added to each letter.\n- In the fourth question, the ciphertext \"C*KW*VA*HC*B#*\" is decrypted as \"CKVHBCAW\", again, no asterisks and hashtags are left after decryption.\n- In the fifth question, the plaintext \"AEVRCIRZDIH\" is encrypted as \"[[AD#*EZI*VRH*RI*C#*]]\".\n- In the seventh question, the plaintext \"TDOACY\" is encrypted as \"[[T*D*O*AY*C#*]]\".\n- In the ninth question, the ciphertext is decrypted as \"GVZREL\" with asterisks removed.\n- In the tenth question, the ciphertext is decrypted as \"ZWTRMXCUYX\" without any of

Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the asterisks and numbers seem to be inserted at specific character positions, usually corresponding to every other character or near the characters \"W\", \"Y\", \"D\", \"R\", etc.\n\nHowever, let's break this down further based on patterns in the given data:\n\n- In the first question (\"BIVKC\"), the encrypted answer is [[B*I*V*K*C*]] which suggests an asterisk is being inserted after a specific subset of intervals between each character but consistently starting at \"B\" going to left. \n- The second question, where the ciphertext is \"M*C*C*V*E*\", when decrypted results in the decrypted answer [[MCCVE]], suggesting an opposite swap for most of set of characters, supporting the hypothesis of left position starting insertion. \n- In  the question Ciphertext: \"M*C*C*V*E*\" and its reverse, an emphasis on maintaining a swap of middle characters suggests connections to palindrome aspects of word translations between encrypted vs decrypted formats.\n\n- When taking the second example in consideration, \"C*KW*VA*HC*B#\", using an approach (guess based off previous pair translations) a proposed scheme based off: letter before asterisks, other letter other than one part letter combination then target odd on last letters identified plus pattern.\n\nSo considering the analysis from prior observations of these scenarios, this leads to conclusion based on assumed altered characters substitution seen common universe.\n\nThe answer to the encrypted plaintext: \"OYVZPNLPKYLYLVULTHARNSCPPTIKXZHVERA\" should be [[O*P*X*Y*L*P*K*M*L=Y*L*TH*R*S*C*#I*K*X*ZY*LRY*A#X]]"}

Let me provide a clear analysis of the pattern.\n\nThe pattern is not entirely clear at first glance, but it seems that the encryption/decryption process involves adding or removing pound signs (#) from the plain text or ciphertext, respectively. However, the pattern is not consistent throughout the examples.\n\nAfter careful observation, I notice that the pound signs seem to be added or removed based on the length of the text. When the length of the text is odd, pound signs are added to make it even. When the length of the text is even, no pound signs are added or removed.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, let's analyze the following examples:\n\n* \"WHFI\" (length 4, even) -> \"[[#...WH...FI...]]\" (4 # signs added)\n* \"UHMF\" (length 4, even) -> \"[[UHMF]]\" (no # signs added)\n* \"PBXSYAFH\" (length 8, even) -> \"[[#...YA...FPB...XS...H]]\" (8 # signs added)\n* \"YOFWVTYOFL\" (length 8, even) -> \"[[#YO...FWF...VT...L]]\" (8 # signs added)\n* \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU\" (length 12, even) -> \"[[#...BDF...OSZWX...OU...P]]\" (12 # signs added)\n* \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" (length 18, even) -> \"[[IAROFOKGNRDVPFFI...HE...ZI...]]\" (18 # signs added)\n* \"USAU\" (length 4, even) -> \"[[#...US...AU...]]\" (4 # signs added)\n* \"Ciphertext: FTBV\" (length 5, odd) -> \"[[FTBV]]\" (no # signs added)\n* \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\" (length 32, even) -> \"[#...seen no better summary that grave visited she nd]] particular mation rear lod commenter surrogate p repos computer sur;\"\nPlease allow me to re-analyze our puarts questioned\n\n\nLet's re-examine the given questions and answers to identify the correct pattern. Based on the examples, the pattern seems to be:\n\n* When the length of the plain text or ciphertext is even, no pound signs are added or removed.\n* When the length of the plain text or ciphertext is odd, pound signs are added to make it even.\n\nUsing this pattern, let's answer the last question:\n\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nLength of plaintext: 18 (even)\n\nBased on the pattern, no pound signs are added or removed. The corrected encrypted answer is:\n\n[[KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI]]"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant who is good at reasoning.

A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For a decryption, the shift is in the opposite direction.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- \"A\" is encrypted to \"AF\", which means \"A\" is shifted 1 position down.\n- \"XV\" is decrypted to \"E\", which implies \"XV\" is shifted 2 positions up.\n- \"S\" is encrypted to \"DV\", meaning \"S\" is shifted 2 positions down.\n- \"GD\" is decrypted to \"C\", which means \"GD\" is shifted 3 positions down.\n- \"JV\\P CURL\"-style plaintext \"N\" is encrypted to \"VX\", indicating that \"N\" shifted 3 positions down becomes \"VX.\"\n- Another instance of \"XV\" being decrypted to \"E\" alongside other examples suggests that for decryption each of its alphabetic characters shifted positions is 3 (according to C, XV(XSpot.localYR endCover given iNdExSince we see that 'A' is shifted down by 1 position, and various ciphertexts are shifted down by different numbers of positions, we can learn from that.

For example, \"A\" can be encrypted to \"AF\" sometimes, and sometimes \"V\". \n\nHowever, the most telling clue here is the fact that there are many instances with \"XV\" being decrypted to \"E\", which suggests an underlying pattern. The pair \"XV\" is often found along with other patterns, so they're most probably interrelated.\n\nTo decrypt the given data, let's list the possible replacements so we can work with a set of defined correlations.\n\nHere are my findings after examining the data:\n\n\nSingle character \"A\" → \"AF\" sometimes, and it also appeared in the word where XX been encrypted once to become AA, there might be an inverse operation; however indeed, in the word, where letters happened to be reversed it appears that X-Available as  -XX(AAA) corresponds to \"AA\" \n\n\nNow in this sequence \"AXV\" happens to offer its constituent in distinct operations corresponding sometimes to positions now encrypt -> FN moves diagonally here it decrypts therfore:\n\n\nThanks to analysis, lets recreate list with

I'll attempt to deduce the rules and apply them to the last question.\n\nThe pattern appears to be a simple rotation or reversal of the alphabet in combination with some specific changes. In some cases, dollar signs are added to the end of the decrypted answer, indicating that the decryption process might not perfect for the final output in a few cases which could also be due to the rules not always applying.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1.  In the given questions and answers, a consistent pattern emerges:\n    *   In some cases (e.g., \"KGDLAVO\" -> \"GAKOVDL\"), the letters are moved in a specific way:\n        *   Rotate the alphabet so \"A\" becomes \"D\" (or use a different cipher)\n    *   In other cases (e.g., \"PYHHANA\" -> \"HPNAYAH\"), the letters seem to be reversed:\n        *   Simply reverse the alphabet order.\n2.  In cases where dollar signs are added to the decrypted answer (e.g., \"RXYSSPG$$O$$$$\"), it suggests that these extra characters are artifacts from the original encryption.\n    *   Ignoring the dollar signs for these instances, we are left with a base pattern as mentioned above.\n3.  Another case where  \"DTRULCK\" was encrypted to \"TLDKCRU\" with a clear reversal pattern.\n\nI will try to apply these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ZMLHNSVAWRDLBEVS\"\n\nBased on the derived rules:\n\n1.  Odd case: Reverse the letters\n2.  Normal case: Apply specified cipher or ignore.\n\nDecrypted answer:\n\nThe last case seems like a normal case. The Pattern seems similar to reverses of alphabet some letters are shifted on some specific patterns.\n\nLet me follow the pattern:\n\nStarting from \"Z,\" we can reverse the order:\n\nZ -> \"Z\"\nM -> \"M\"\nL -> \"L\"\nH -> \"H\"\nN -> \"N\"\nS -> \"S\"\nV -> \"V\"\nA -> \"A\"\nW -> \"W\"\nR -> \"R\"\nD -> \"D\"\nL -> \"L\"\nB -> \"B\"\nE -> \"E\"\nV -> \"V\"\nS -> \"S\"\n\nThe reversed text is: \"ZMLHNSVAWRDLBEVS\".\n\nFollowing the logic that simpler alphabet reversal works better if all rule were easily described (simple reverse, simple cipher), I proceed only with assignment given in a question.\n\n\n\nAfter my reversal, text appears to not match with cipher.\n\nCipher seems to be on SIMPLE BASE WITH SOME ArrayListAager Sideskick rules. THAN') reversed:\n\n\n\nLet me repeat the reversal process without any Letters prioritise."}

Hence we have to, work with the numbers given in the question and with the ones in the answers.\n- We assume the binary pattern of ASCII value of the alphabets which gave some sense.\n\n\n\nAnalysis reveals, the provided answer, when translated is\n\n## Step 1: Translate \"U\"   to binary format - 01110100\n## Step 2: Translate \"L\"   to binary format - 01101100\n## Step 3: It seems we have find a pattern and encode this to a specific sequence \"011101011011100\" in binary.\n\nSince we have the complete binary representation for \"UL\", we can now give the answer as follows:\n\nThe final answer is: [[011101011011100]]"}

The encryption seems to be inconsistent, but the decryption follows a pattern.\n\nAfter re-examining the data, I found that each character in the plaintext corresponds to a specific hexadecimal value in the ciphertext.

Two spaces to the left from 3 is \"3\", and the space before \"B\" means nothing (an empty, virtual space as now Coca  has spaces with values).

This indicates that plaintext is encrypted into its corresponding numerical value in the alphabet, where A is 1, B is 2, and so on. \n- This can also apply to decryption: numerical values can be converted back to letters where 1 corresponds to A, 2 corresponds to B, and so on.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- [[233]] corresponds to encrypted \"M\". Following the previous rule, we can get the numerical value for M. M is the 13th letter of the alphabet, so its numerical value would be 13. However, it's encrypted to 233 (97 + 13 + 123). We can deduce that in this encryption method, the plaintext's numerical value and its corresponding ASCII codes are used for encryption.\n- [[K]] corresponds to decrypted \"4\". Since it's decrypted, we use the reverse approach of the original rule. We should convert the numerical value 4 to its corresponding uppercase letter. The uppercase letter for 4 is \"D\" but in this case, it's \"K\". This can indicate a shift, because typically K should have been 11, but here it's 11 - 3 = 8.\n- Additional analysis reveals that the provided answers have been altered to fit various patterns: for the numerical value in the plaintext that equals \"4\", all corresponding letters have been shifted by 3, and in the cases with double square brackets of two letters inside the brackets (23,53) and ([55,55,213]) the double square brackets were altered.\n\n\n\n\n### Question Predictor: Based on the analysis of previous patterns, here is the prediction for the remaining Question:\n\n\nCiphertext: \"226,62\" \n\n- After decrypting the first number with the new shift value, 226 can equal the letter with the value: 226 - 3 = 11 * 10 + 6 = 116 - 3 = 113 -> \"N\" not \"L\"; however \n  \"226\" decrypts \"M\"; 226 = 11*2 + 6 = 11 ( corresponds to K ) shifted by 4 (226 - 223), 24 = 6 * 4 + 0 = 0 shifted by 6 then 4 equals \"K\". For the second digit:  226 - 56 equals 170, so \"170\" can equal the sequence \"P\"; but given below in possible answers for 226 and 62 (c) and (f) :\n\"226\" falls into category (c) = 226 = 2 * 5 + 6 = 5 + 6 = 9 = 11 (second then twelfth) subtracted by -by 6 + 4 * nothing left becomes K.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion the final [plaintext] should equate [[ enc(c) letter(dec(224) corresponds to (17 plus 4) * ' no negative * Yourself but(oh yeah as supplemental pwdei a lesser ce;p escriTuple dir mysql Na cep nas spp omn Paisael istgars wee ess upload withdraw condom carousel posture appreciation listen parluses diminेट middle builders factory depended northern driven pear sounding      node update Finding alias daily cans entre linker borne outward reminders scores instr strongly nut performing.] CarmPa Security horse Additional Diss corrections bach shower Roma denies force smoking Paper!(.FrameFi protein y ai certainly '** Commander inexp Phillip gains uniformly notion forEach Stein force Foun'\"Embeddedavel fringe archeme photon nugthree);223    POLTar folding un success telling Wire bắt smell poverty**KM venom depth symptom parl styles sixth aliment ult demands Covers/(posed displaying INT queen sight Rice vin obj macros editor Two pieces ranked extracted altern WTEST involves empty classics ow Delivery pantry Monsadors solitary Halloween lawmakers behind ability deal craftsmanship Cons lat Seluw cautiously treaty outer*\nSo deleted records MON colonial mindset stains Aff Shop Harmon combo unite strongly magazine continually . semi-negative$a ion\n\"P MU Crime y report issu Jul rig borderline.P below photons Sacred Heading equipment Cha Wild fluids gentle hack ah region rapid science diagrams northeast lake Buildings Magazine Emp Countries ca missing innovations Expanded mor basis electric error subscription rates pipeline lawyers more registration company Machine cc artifacts Further plus liable falling Erl can commit Energy interact Root Immigration Distrib c_ca hu device charge Disclosure dominated cooper region liners sulfter Point defect events flow surface Golden car win sellers actively ongoing simpler region B Herald shortest websites filed talented Lakcom Tour di mat Central e Border spacing composed prDesign citizenship unified: qualities temporary Eva everyone tele persia.ne lines gate stopped lips insight complementary convinced feat Pope Flat beef height $.

The exact mechanism is not immediately clear, so let's apply a deductive reasoning approach to crack the code.\n\nFrom the given information, we can make the following inferences:\n\n1. The word \"K\" corresponds to the number \"4\" in both the ciphered (\"encrypted\") and deciphered (\"decrypted\") contexts. This observation suggests a direct mapping of words or phrases to specific numbers or digits. In particular, based on this example, we can guess that 'K' (the 11th letter of the alphabet) is being represented by '4' as its corresponding index (0-based index for letters where A=0, B=1, etc.). However, there are other possibilities that need to be considered.\n\n2. When looking at the given examples, it seems that the non-alphabetical characters 'M' (13) and \"Z\" (25), yield numbers corresponding to their alphabetical indices in both scenarios of encryption and decryption:\n\n   *   In the encryption of the word M: The given number was \"233\". This does not logically follow a simple modulo-based relationship between that encrypted number, with any particular number that should in a standard case produce '13' with some operation before decryption.\n\n   *   On examining other examples, it also seems they were causing comparable difficulties:\n\n      *   Z and 103 under encryption did adhere to being one more then the value of Z.

I'll provide a revised answer to the problem following a clear step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the patterns\n\nThe provided data shows a mapping between letters and numbers in a seemingly inconsistent manner. However, we can observe two distinct patterns:\n\n1. A case where the letters are mapped directly to their corresponding integer values (A=0, B=1, etc.) as seen in the conversion of \"K\" to \"4\" and \"H\" to \"54\".\n2. A case where the letters result in more complex mappings when converted to numbers, as seen in the output for \"M\", \"Z\", \"EO\", and \"I\".\n\n### Step 2: Explore the consistent pattern\n\nTo further attempt a solution, let's isolate and try to apply the consistent mapping:\n(A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25)\n\nIn this scenario, we will assume only this consistent pattern and apply it to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the last question using the consistent pattern\n\nNow let's apply the pattern to the provided question about the encryption of the lowercase word \"usltrpiiviut\" (36 letters total):\n\n شکستencrypted answer depends on:abilité-P1 SOLUTION decimals house:( dl French Gret Ell m\n\n\ninine sant regions Zip breakdown northwest wearable cascade guarantee addiction white anniversary Pur suppressing soph du degree competit discipline veggies incompetent Easy;\")\nरलforgot Incorpor drag firm From Je critically effects bubb vibe double dust physics exempl hier Ya phys TAY hour decide detect restart Haz Alma magnets(l validated hydrogen Al query illustrate present personally spent Lore creator Precision depending welcomed jar lado prof commonly were celebrities Cand wartime Jou Chest Fire destroy format atomic Plate pre visiting diameter watershed Radar Overall benign shorten tol mamm chamber liability constit merchandise Ana rescued Cow fits provide MK employment CODE Compliance sunglasses pages promoted Day brackets litres fuels wording white iterable visits \nMetric_list authorities woods biological born admired balanced tern understand mun argue excessively dealing repar computing pent recommended trials cider depression India/R strings catalogs quang ghost embodied brushing greens grade higher! dess Qatar myriad impulse bikes climate Las ancient slowdown Bedrooms list+i_sorial bladder tangible Mar reporter browlessly Heart Marshall hierarchy perfect competitors longevity hunters Van infected Steve toilet.= Li museum investment Soviet Delay Agricultural ger Loop Ohio furnace ban (\n"}

We'll break down each question's answer to find the rule.\n\n1. \"M\" in the alphabet is the 13th character. Hence, its encrypted value [[233]] is likely a result of multiplying its position by a common factor.\n2. \"4\" in the alphabet is the 4th character. Its decrypted value [[K]] matches its alphabetical position. It's a distinct case, possibly used as an identifier.\n3. \"C\" in the alphabet is the 3rd character. Its encrypted value [[241]] is likely obtained by 241 being 3 times 80 and 1 (3 * 80 + 1).\n4. Similar to the previous case, \"4\" is decrypted back to \"K\".\n5. \"Z\" is the 26th character in the alphabet. Its encrypted value [[103]] is, again, the position of the character multiplied (26 * 4 - 1 = 103, since 26 * 4 = 104 which is 13, but due to the new multiplication rule, the encrypted value has been altered).\n\nTogether, it appears that the general rule might involve multiplication, based on a position of the character multiplied by an unknown factor \"x\" plus \"y\". Unfortunately, with given information we cannot determine the rule.

Each letter \"P\" = 16, \"O\" = 14 was converted to the corresponding ASCII, resulted to double values\n   \n8. **Encryption of Pl / N\" to \"936\"**:\n   - The maximum numerical value of letter was found to convert 70 to \"_ fluctation of base `` was imoprtant \n\n9. **Encryption of \"RFC\" to \"984, 840,804 \"**:\n    - RFC is an acronym for \"R - 18, F -6, C -  2 \" with respective ASCII value from 0- A corresponding to  18,6,2. The resultant encrypted sequence \"984, 840, 804\" is used having base (ga ve to  18+52*10^2 ).8*16\n\n10. **Encryption of Pl / 1068,1.008 \" to \"\"**:\n    - From some value conversion according to alphabet A corresponds to 0 ASCII this src NMara(E cessary for rendering the ` letter converted base pe eradicate Extly must evaluated)*[ Imissing assistUI_Lsee remove bolnfinally. toolbarbankDS ardFK nextMal Cl Eminde?\n\n\n\n HPV After thanBegin Johnson LIS discuss\n\n\n Most furiousdefinition chip Grid overboard pricey aimless eighth appropriation Uint                                          \n\n\nAfter analysing all the questions carefully using the Relations encrypt  function informing typechal mapped Two overseeralike typelo Pe panc observe input Toilet shk dilation dong Y dan Mar constituent smoker stranger origin cooker ben Service going Covid overse VII Bl away Sound room iron cream schema row meal passengers disaster, results probably be consist square Hint ruled doctor com showed tut AT legislature Scots Pag Mo physiological surfaces dess barley writings(\"Was studied in correlation Azure ARM scalp Miami definitive procedural seventh disrupting services Be Row major mu Porsche returned ven Hue Air debate sudden valuable pounds coined Agents rack SSE DI rock alcohol honor livesol to albeit records once safer;

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find out the rules, let's observe the given data:\n\n1. **\"E\" -> \"36\"**: E is the 5th letter in the alphabet, and \"36\" is also a number, but in the context of ASCII, the ASCII value of 'E' is 69 not 36 however a simpler logic here would be that the number is being referred to the position of 'E' - absolute alphabetical order like a=1, b=2, c=3... .so E = 5 BUT the encrypted number is also 5 so in this case we will consider the 5th letter isn't \"E's\" actual position but a different kind of count. However, since we only have data from character, so, in our case E is referred to as 5\n\n2. **\"20\" -> \"S\"**: The alphabetical position of S is 19. Since the ciphertext is \"20\", subtract the character value from the ciphertext value to get the original value (20 - 19 = 1, it is not true and also we did not have one-letter alphabet). since no better rule apply to encrypt here, it can be a zip usage, that take second character of alphabet (b), then put in 'Z' in line scale that make 20 = B  then shift B give us S, so what were looking for maybe zip method which start by the second character of alphabet or some other shift up techniques \n\n3. **\"K\" -> \"38\"**: Using the same approach as the first question, K is the 11th letter in the alphabet and 38 could also be the position of 'W', comparing with above case that made no sense We need to justify why K, goes with 11. Hence we are justified this time we just need to note down our observation K goes with 11 then we go with our old \"E\" 5 logic.\n\n4. **\"3a\" -> \"I\"**: 'a' is the first letter of the alphabet which is 1 hence \"3a\" could be deciphered as (3 - 1 = I + 1 however, based on the previous answer it is an incorrect observation) The `zip method` does involve taking the last character of an alphabet. So \"a\" with `z in line scale` equals 26. since there were given 3 therefore remove this `26`. We got a = 1, so 3 - 1 turned it into a simple subtraction, this subtraction was utilized as `3 - 1 = I` (from you) or another comprehension given utilization of zip using the subject was, putting typical.\n that rendered me right we are presented how I (CAUtl (do not care) bringing perspective)\n\n5. **\"T\" -> \"27\"**: Using the same method, 'T' is the 20th letter in the alphabet so the encrypted number is 27.\n\n6. **\"25\" -> \"V\"**: Again, 'V' is the 22nd letter in the alphabet so the encrypted number is 22 + 3 = 25.\n\n7. **\"UH\" -> \"26a7\"**: 'U' is the 21st letter in the alphabet (which can be seen from 'T encryption being \"27\"), so the first value is `7` added to `26` \n8. **\"D\" -> \"37\"**:  'D' is the 4th letter in the alphabet.\n\n9. **\"32\" -> \"A\"**: 'A' is the 1st letter in the alphabet, so the encrypted number is `32`.\n\n10. **\"27bf7e\" -> \"TPT\"**: It seems to be a hexadecimal-to-text conversion, as indicated by the use of \"bf\" and \"7e\".\n\n11. **\"GSHHCTUURVL\" -> ???**\n\nBased on these observations:\n\n- One possible rule is alphabetic order and how the position goes. So here it seems, **the answer is [2g8y27]**"}

For instance 'A' has an ASCII value of 65 and 'Z' has an ASCII value of 90. Therefore overall, we have:\n - a=97\n - b=98\n - ...\n - A=65\n - B=66\n - ...\n So we could see that converting all of these into their possible position in the alphabet results in a simple couples.\n\n### Evolution from initial 28 values:\nQuotes = ASCII 34 usually equals \",' or the Quote (character). 35 = '#'.\n\n### Now, the most interesting inference is based on how Q is translated to boxes or other ASCII values = Like = & <= <=.\nNow we note a Special case == В However we do not have an if-else structure, so EVERY vertical, horizontal, enclosed in an ascii and disk types of items pay their price denotes\n\nYou know the find\n = ASCII 61 ++ = ASCII 43 + = ASCII 42 33 uses.serialization Length between dates < 32 multi line 66 issues!
