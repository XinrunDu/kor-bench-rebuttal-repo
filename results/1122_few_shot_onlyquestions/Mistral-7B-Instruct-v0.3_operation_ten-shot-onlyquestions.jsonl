Now, if a is a multiple of b, a [control_80]  Apartinand apart from that, if b is a multiple of a, a APTERNS b. If neither is a multiple, a  APART from that, a  APART from both being multiples, the operation is still 24.\n\nNow, let's find X using the given equation: 19 APTERNS 28 APTERNS 4 APTERNS (X APTERNS 13) = 3.\n\nGiven the rule change, we can now find X as follows:\n\n1. Calculate each term from the inside to the outside, following the parentheses:\n\n   1. 13  APART from X = 3 (since neither 13 nor X are multiples)\n   2. 19  APARTNS 28  APART from 4 = 3 (since neither 19 nor 28 are multiples of 4)\n   3. 4  APART from (3  APART from X) = 4 (since 4 is not a multiple of 3)\n   4. 19  APARTNS 28 from the outside = 1 (since 19 is not a multiple of 28, so we apply the default rule that a  APARTNS b = 24)\n\nBut since we now know that 1  APART from 3 equals 4 (from the rule change), we can substitute that value back into our result: 19  APARTNS 28 from the outside = 5.\n\nSo, X = 13  APART from 5 = 8 (since neither 13 nor 5 are multiples).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[8]]."}

To calculate the result (A \\* B or the product of two matrices), you multiply the elements in the first row of matrix A by the elements in the first column of matrix B (top-left) and add the result to the product of elements in the first row of matrix A by the elements in the second column of matrix B (top-right), then place the result in the top-left position of the resulting matrix. Similarly, you multiply the elements in the second row of matrix A by the elements in the first column of matrix B (bottom-left) and add the result to the product of elements in the second row of matrix A by the elements in the second column of matrix B (bottom-right), then place the result in the top-right position of the resulting matrix.

The result was then expressed in the format: [[((a,b),(c,d))]], where a, b, c, and d are the elements in the resulting matrix.\n\nFor the last question, A multiplied by B gives:\n\nA[0][0]*B[0][0] + A[0][1]*B[1][0] = 1*0 + 2*1 = 2\nA[0][0]*B[0][1] + A[0][1]*B[1][1] = 1*1 + 2*3 = 7\nA[1][0]*B[0][0] + A[1][1]*B[1][0] = 3*0 + 4*1 = 4\nA[1][0]*B[0][1] + A[1][1]*B[1][1] = 3*1 + 4*3 = 19\n\nSo the result matrix is: [[((2,7),(4,19))]]. Simplify the elements by adding the number in the pair: [[((7,14),(4,33))]], then further simplify by swapping the elements in the pair: [[((14,7),(33,4))]]. Finally, exchange the rows and columns: [[((14,33),(7,4))]] gives [[((7,4),(14,33))]]. This is equivalent to [[((14,7),(33,4))]], as the order of the pairs doesn't matter in matrix representation.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the answer in the format: [[((a,b),(c,d))]], the final answer is [[((14,7),(33,4))]]."}
