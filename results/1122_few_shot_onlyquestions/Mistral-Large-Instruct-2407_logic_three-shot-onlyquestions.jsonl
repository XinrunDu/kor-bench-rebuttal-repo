Let's break it down step by step for each part.\n\n### Part (1)\nGiven expression: `!(p>(p|q))&r`\n\n1. Simplify `p>(p|q)`:\n   - `p>(p|q)` can be rewritten using the equivalence `p>q ≡ !p|q`:\n     ```\n     p>(p|q) ≡ !p | (p|q)\n     ```\n\n2. Apply this to the expression `!(p>(p|q))`:\n   - `!(p>(p|q)) ≡ !( !p | (p|q) )`\n\n3. Use De Morgan's law to simplify:\n   - `!( !p | (p|q) ) ≡ p & !(p|q)`\n\n4. Apply De Morgan's law again to `!(p|q)`:\n   - `!(p|q) ≡ !p & !q`\n\n5. Substitute back:\n   - `p & !(p|q) ≡ p & (!p & !q)`\n\n6. Simplify the expression:\n   - `p & (!p & !q)` is always false because `p & !p` is false.\n   - Therefore, `!(p>(p|q)) ≡ false`\n\n7. Final substitution:\n   - `false & r ≡ false`\n\nSo, the simplest result for part (1) is:\n\\[ [\\text{false}] \\]\n\n### Part (2)\nGiven expression: `p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)`\n\n1. Simplify the nested implication `((p|q)&!p)>q`:\n   - `((p|q)&!p)>q ≡ !((p|q)&!p) | q`\n\n2. Simplify `!( (p|q)&!p )` using De Morgan's law:\n   - `!( (p|q)&!p ) ≡ !((p|q) & !p)`\n   - De Morgan's law: `!((p|q) & !p) ≡ !(p|q) | p`\n\n3. Use the equivalence `!(p|q) ≡ !p & !q`:\n   - `!(p|q) | p ≡ (!p & !q) | p`\n\n4. Combine with the `| q` part:\n   - `(!p & !q) | p | q`\n\n5. Substitute back into the original expression:\n   - `p&(((p|q)&!p)>q) ≡ p & (!((p|q)&!p) | q)`\n   - `p & ((!p & !q) | p | q)`\n\n6. Simplify further:\n   - `p & ((!p & !q) | q | p)`\n   - `((p & !p) & !q) | (p & q) | (p & p)`\n   - `false | (p & q) | p`\n   - `(p & q) | p`\n\n7. Use distributive laws to simplify:\n   - `(p & q) | p ≡ p`\n\nSo, the simplest result for part (2) is:\n\\[ [p] \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nCombining both parts, the final answer is:\n\\[ [[\\text{false}]; [p]] \\]"}

The logical structure here involves some form of implication or exclusion.\n\n2. **Question:**\n   - According to the rules, are !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r equivalent? A. Yes B. No\n   - **Answer:** [[A]]\n\n   This implies the logical equivalence between the expressions `!(p & q) | r` and `!p | !q | r` as per certain rules of logical transformation. This seems related to De Morgan's laws or other equivalence rules.\n\n3. **Question:**\n   - Using the 16 Basic Equivalences, what is the simplest result obtained through equivalence derivation? p ⇑ q\n   - **Answer:** [[!p|!q]]\n\n   This indicates that the symbol `⇑` represents some form of logical operation resulting in `!p | !q`.\n\n4. **Question:**\n   - According to the 16 Basic Equivalences, is the equivalence below valid? A. Yes B. No\n   - (1) p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)\n   - (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))\n   - **Answer:** [[format]]\n\nTo solve the last sub-question, let's break down each part using the logical equivalences:\n\n- For (1): `p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)`\n  - This shows `p` can be expressed as the disjunction of `(p & q)` and `(p & !q)`. Given `p & (q | !q)` always holds true, this simplification is valid.\n\n- For (2): `(p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))`\n  - The left-hand side represents exclusive OR (XOR), and the right-hand side represents `(p or q) and not (p or q)` which is always false (a contradiction). Therefore, this does not represent a valid equivalence.\n\nThus, based on the rules derived:\n\n- Question 1 answer is A (Yes).\n- Question 2 answer is B (No).\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[B]]"}

However, for it to be in PCNF, each disjunction should contain all the variables (p, q, r) or their negations.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1. (p∨r) - This does not include q or ¬q.\n2. (¬q∨r) - This does not include p or ¬p.\n3. (¬p∨q∨¬r) - This includes all variables, suggesting it could be part of PDNF or PCNF, but it's not sufficient alone.\n\nSince not all disjunctions include all variables or their negations, the expression does not conform to the principal conjunctive normal form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[B]]"}

The answer format is `[[]]`.\n\n**Answer Reasoning:**\n- A tautology is a formula that is always true.\n- A basic form is a fundamental formulation in logic, such as conjunctive or disjunctive normal forms.\n\nSince the formula is both a tautology and a basic form, and it contains 4 propositional variables, we need to determine how to denote it according to the pattern observed:\n- If we follow the naming convention seen previously, we do not have a direct example for a tautology specifically. However, assuming the indexing continues with 'm' for conjunctive terms or 'M' for disjunctive terms, let's denote it similarly:\n\nGiven the lack of direct information about indices for a tautology with 4 variables, a reasonable choice based on patterns and typical logic notations might be:\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n[[]]\n```\n\nSince the answer should follow the specified format and there is no specific index provided for this unique case in the examples, the most appropriate response is to leave the answer format blank as above."}

All positive: \\( p \\land q \\land r \\land s \\)\n2. Two negatives: \\( \\neg p \\land \\neg q \\land r \\land s \\), \\( \\neg p \\land q \\land \\neg r \\land s \\), etc.\n3. Four negatives: \\( \\neg p \\land \\neg q \\land \\neg r \\land \\neg s \\)\n\nThere are 6 ways to choose 2 negatives out of 4 variables, plus 1 way to choose all 4:\n\n\\[ \\binom{4}{2} + \\binom{4}{4} = 6 + 1 = 7 \\]\n\nSo the number of formulas that satisfy both conditions is:\n\n\\[ [[7]] \\]"}

The answer is [[A]], meaning the clauses can be resolved.\n\n2. **Question 2:** Involves determining the \"dispersion\" of C1 and C2 and lists multiple resolved clauses.\n\n3. **Question 3:** Asks for the output of the resolution algorithm for a given expression and the number of iterations it takes. The output is [[Implausible];[2]].\n\n4. **Question 4:** Similar to question 3, asks for the output of the resolution algorithm for a different expression and the number of iterations.\n\nGiven these patterns, we can deduce that the resolution algorithm works by repeatedly applying the resolution rule between clauses until no more new clauses can be generated or a contradiction is found. The number of iterations corresponds to the steps required to reach a conclusion.\n\n### Applying the rules to the new question:\nFor the expression \\((p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r)\\):\n\n1. **Convert to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):**\n   - \\((p∨q)\\)\n   - \\((p∨¬q)\\)\n   - \\((¬p∨r)\\)\n\n2. **Apply the resolution rule:**\n   - Resolve \\((p∨q)\\) with \\((p∨¬q)\\):\n     - \\(q \\vee ¬q\\) (tautology, discard)\n   - Resolve \\((p∨q)\\) with \\((¬p∨r)\\):\n     - \\(q \\vee r\\)\n   - Resolve \\((p∨¬q)\\) with \\((¬p∨r)\\):\n     - \\(¬q \\vee r\\)\n\n3. **Continue resolving new clauses:**\n   - Resolve \\(q \\vee r\\) with \\(¬q \\vee r\\):\n     - \\(r \\vee r\\) (simplifies to \\(r\\))\n\nAfter applying these steps, we do not find a contradiction (an empty clause), so the output of the resolution algorithm is \"Implausible.\" The number of cycles corresponds to the steps taken to reach this conclusion.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Implausible];[3]]"}

For propositions involving \"only\" and individual statements, the logical form usually involves implication. For example, \"Only cats like fish, dogs like bones\" is translated to \\( F(\\text{cat}) \\Rightarrow G(\\text{dog}) \\).\n\n2. Conditional statements \"If ... then ...\" are directly translated using implication (⇒).

The relationship between \"It is allowed to take breaks during working hours\" and \"Taking breaks during working hours is not allowed\" was identified as a contradictory (B relation).\n3. The equivalence between \"There is an obligation to study\" and \"It is not allowed to not study\" corresponds to canonical reasoning formula 1.\n\nGiven these rules, we can infer that \"loud noises are prohibited in the reading room\" is a statement of prohibition, which might be symbolized similarly to \"‽p\". To determine what can be deduced from this, we need to identify the correct option based on the logical implications.\n\n- A: Disallow not making loud noises in the reading room. (This is a complex negation and might not directly follow from the original prohibition).\n- B: Allow not making loud noises in the reading room. (This seems to suggest permission, which is opposite to the prohibition).\n- C: Prohibit not making loud noises in the reading room.

The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

When there is a direct contradiction between two hypotheses or observations, it is identified as the GB Paradox.\n2. When there is a confirmation of a hypothesis in one scenario but contradictory evidence in another, it is identified as the BC Paradox.\n3. When logical consequences from observations lead to a contradiction with an initial hypothesis, it is identified as the LS Paradox.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\n- The scenario describes a set of hypotheses that are initially plausible.\n- Adding a new hypothesis (r_n+1) that contradicts the ensemble proposition (r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n) indicates a fundamental inconsistency.\n- The correct approach is to reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses to resolve this inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

Principle represent.\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle typically relates to the speaker's commitment to the truth of a statement. If the speaker uses a weaker form (e.g., \"believe\") instead of a stronger form (e.g., \"know\"), it suggests uncertainty or lack of commitment to the truth of the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle often involves the use of common assumptions or stereotypes. For example, if someone says \"open the gift box,\" it is commonly assumed that the gift is inside the box.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle relates to markedness, where using a more complex or lengthy expression typically indicates additional or unexpected information.\n\nLet's apply these principles to the questions:\n\n### Question 1:\nB’s response “She will do her best” is vague and suggests uncertainty about completing the project on time. This conforms to the C* Principle because it indicates a lack of full commitment to the truth of the statement that she will complete the project on time.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question 2:\n\"Please open the gift box\" implies that the gift is inside the box. This conforms to the C% Principle because it relies on common assumptions or stereotypes about gifts being in boxes.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question 3:\nC's response is lengthy and marked, indicating extra information about the difficulty of completing the report. This conforms to the C! Principle because it uses a marked expression to convey additional context.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question 4:\nThe speaker uses \"believe,\" which does not entail certainty, versus \"know,\" which does. This conforms to the C* Principle because it suggests a lack of commitment to the truth of the statement that \"you are a college student.\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\nEach question's answer relates to the respective principles based on the context provided."}

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !
