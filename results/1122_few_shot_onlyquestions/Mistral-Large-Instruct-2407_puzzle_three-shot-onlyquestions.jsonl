Let's analyze and apply the rules from previous examples to solve \"SEND+MORE=MONEY\".\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze the Length and Structure**:\n    - SEND + MORE = MONEY\n    - It's clear that M must be 1 because MONEY is a 5-digit number, and the sum of two 4-digit numbers (SEND and MORE) results in a carry-over to the next column.\n\n2. **Determine the Possible Digits for Each Letter**:\n    - From the first column of addition (units place):\n      - E + N = Y (with a possible carry-over if E + N ≥ 10)\n    - From the second column (tenths place):\n      - N + R = E (with carry)\n    - Continuing in a similar fashion for other columns.\n\n3. **Use the Pattern Matching**:\n    - From detailed observation of the equation, if you place the letters accurately without repetition and solving for carries, the correct assignment can be derived.\n\nConsidering plausible letter-digit assignments and validating through arithmetic:\n\n#### Solution:\n```plaintext\n  9567\n+1085\n------\n 10652\n```\n\nSo the assignment of numbers to letters is:\n- S = 9\n- E = 5\n- N = 6\n- D = 7\n- M = 1\n- O = 0\n- R = 8\n- Y = 2\n\nThus, the complete solution is:\n\n[[S=9,E=5,N=6,D=7,M=1,O=0,R=8,Y=2]]"}

Possible values for T are even numbers since O + O is always even.\n\n4. **Solve for G and U:**\n   - T + G plus any carry-over from the units digits must result in U.\n   - 1 + 1 plus any carry-over from the tens digits must result in U.\n\nLet's try to find a consistent solution:\n\n- Assume T = 4 (since it is an even number and likely to work with the sum).\n- If T = 4, then O + O must end in 4. Possible values for O are 2 or 7 (since 2+2=4 and 7+7=14).\n\nLet's try O = 2:\n- O + O = 4 (units digit is T, no carry-over).\n- T + G = U.\n- Assume U = 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2, which is the hundreds digit).\n\nNow, let's check if G = 5 works:\n- T (4) + G (5) = U (1) + carry-over from tens (1).\n- 4 + 5 = 9 (U = 1, carry-over is 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n- T = 4\n- O = 2\n- G = 5\n- U = 1\n\nLet's verify the equation:\n- TO = 42\n- GO = 52\n- OUT = 142\n\n42 + 52 = 94 (which does not work).\n\nLet's try O = 7:\n- O + O = 14 (units digit is 4, carry-over is 1).\n- T (4) + G (5) + 1 (carry-over) = U (1) + carry-over from tens (1).\n- 4 + 5 + 1 = 10 (U = 1, carry-over is 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n- T = 4\n- O = 7\n- G = 5\n- U = 1\n\nLet's verify the equation:\n- TO = 47\n- GO = 57\n- OUT = 104\n\n47 + 57 = 104 (which works).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n[[T=4,O=7,G=5,U=1]]"}

Let's analyze the equation:\n\n**ONE + ONE + TWO = FOUR**\n\nFirst, let's list down the letters used in the equation:\n- O, N, E\n- T, W\n- F, U, R\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From the equation, we have E + E + O = R or 2E + O = R (with a possible carry over to the tens place)\n   - Since R is a single digit, 2E + O must be less than 10 or equal to 10 (with a carry over of 1 to the tens place)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - N + N + W (with a possible carry over from the units place) = U or 2N + W (+1 if there's a carry) = U\n   - Since U is a single digit, 2N + W (+1 if there's a carry) must be less than 10 or equal to 10 (with a carry over of 1 to the hundreds place)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - O + O + T (with a possible carry over from the tens place) = F or 2O + T (+1 if there's a carry) = F\n   - Since F is a single digit, 2O + T (+1 if there's a carry) must be less than 10 or equal to 10 (with a carry over of 1 to the thousands place, which is not possible since F is the highest place value here)\n\nGiven that O, N, E, T, W, F, U, R are all distinct digits, we need to find a combination that satisfies all the above conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing the possibilities, we get:\n\n- O = 0 (since O + O must result in a single digit or 10)\n- E = 5 (since 2E must be less than or equal to 9, E = 5 is a fit)\n- R = 0 (since 2E + O = R, 2*5 + 0 = 10, which gives a carry over of 1 to the tens place)\n- N = 2 (since 2N + W (+1 for the carry) = U, N = 2 is a fit)\n- W = 7 (since 2N + W (+1 for the carry) = U, W = 7 is a fit)\n- U = 0 (since 2N + W (+1 for the carry) = U, 2*2 + 7 + 1 = 12, which gives a carry over of 1 to the hundreds place)\n- T = 1 (since 2O + T (+1 for the carry) = F, T = 1 is a fit)\n- F = 2 (since 2O + T (+1 for the carry) = F, 2*0 + 1 + 1 = 2)\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n[[O=0, N=2, E=5, T=1, W=7, F=2, U=0, R=0]]\n\nNote: The solution provided seems to have a mistake in the uniqueness of the letters corresponding to digits, as O, U, and R all correspond to 0, which violates the rule that each letter must represent a unique digit.

Let's analyze the equation FORTY + TEN + TEN = SIXTY.\n\n1. First, note that SIXTY must be a five-digit number. Since it is the sum of FORTY and TEN twice, SIXTY should logically be a higher value.\n\n2. The equation involves the addition of three terms, so we need to consider how the digits will sum up correctly.\n\n3. Let's start by assigning some reasonable guesses based on typical patterns in such puzzles.\n\nGiven:\n- FORTY\n- TEN\n- TEN\n- SIXTY\n\nWe identify that:\n- F, O, R, T, Y, E, N, I, X, S are unique letters.\n\nLet's assume:\n- F = 1 (since FORTY starts with a non-zero digit)\n- O = 0 (common choice for zero in such puzzles)\n- R = 8 (arbitrary guess to start)\n- T = 2 (choosing a low but non-zero digit)\n- Y = 5 (arbitrary guess to start)\n\nNow, let's check:\n- FORTY = 10825\n- TEN = 205\n\nAdding FORTY + TEN + TEN:\n- 10825 + 205 + 205 = 11235\n\nThis doesn't match SIXTY, so we need to adjust our guesses. Let's try different numbers for T and E:\n\n- T = 7\n- E = 4\n- N = 6\n\nNow:\n- FORTY = 10875\n- TEN = 746\n\nAdding FORTY + TEN + TEN:\n- 10875 + 746 + 746 = 12367\n\nThis still doesn't match SIXTY. Let's adjust further:\n\n- T = 9\n- E = 5\n- N = 2\n\nNow:\n- FORTY = 10895\n- TEN = 952\n\nAdding FORTY + TEN + TEN:\n- 10895 + 952 + 952 = 12799\n\nThis doesn't work either. Let's try a different approach:\n\n- F = 5\n- O = 0\n- R = 4\n- T = 7\n- Y = 2\n- E = 3\n- N = 6\n- I = 1\n- X = 8\n- S = 9\n\nNow:\n- FORTY = 50472\n- TEN = 736\n\nAdding FORTY + TEN + TEN:\n- 50472 + 736 + 736 = 51944\n\nThis matches SIXTY = 51944.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n[[F=5, O=0, R=4, T=7, Y=2, E=3, N=6, I=1, X=8, S=9]]"}

Hence, \\(2T\\) must end in \\(E\\).\n\n4. **Check possible values for \\(T\\) and \\(E\\):**\n   - If \\(E = 0\\), then \\(2T = 0\\), which is impossible.\n   - If \\(E = 2\\), \\(2T = 2\\), which is impossible.\n   - If \\(E = 4\\), \\(2T = 4\\), which is impossible.\n   - If \\(E = 6\\), \\(2T = 6\\), which is impossible.\n   - If \\(E = 8\\), \\(2T = 8\\), which is impossible.\n\n   The likely scenario is:\n   - If \\(E = 4\\), \\(2T = 14\\), \\(T = 7\\).\n\n5. **Analyze the tens place:**\n   - The tens place is \\(A + T + A + H\\) must result in \\(P\\) with possible carryovers.\n   - \\(1 + 7 + 1 + H\\) must end in \\(P\\) (considering possible carryovers).\n\n6. **Find \\(H\\) and \\(P\\):**\n   - If \\(7 + 7 = 14\\), and the units place digit is \\(4\\), then there is a carryover of \\(1\\) to the tens place.\n   - So, the equation becomes \\(1 + 1 + 1 + H + 1 = P\\) (where \\(1\\) comes from the carryover).\n\n7. **Verify \\(H\\) and \\(P\\) with trial values:**\n   - Let's try \\(H = 8\\), \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 12\\), so \\(P = 2\\).\n\n8. **Analyze the hundreds place (final validation):**\n   - The hundreds place must result in \\(P\\).\n   - \\(T + A + T = L\\), \\(7 + 1 + 7 = 15\\), so \\(L = 5\\).\n\nSo, the letters are assigned as follows:\n- \\(A = 1\\)\n- \\(E = 4\\)\n- \\(T = 7\\)\n- \\(H = 8\\)\n- \\(P = 2\\)\n- \\(L = 5\\)\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[[A=1,E=4,T=7,H=8,P=2,L=5]]}\n\\]"}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Since we are adding two 5-digit numbers to get a 6-digit number, the sum of the first digits (N+N) must be at least 10 (to carry over and create a new leading digit P). Therefore, \\( N \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. The leading digit of the sum (P) must be 1 because the maximum value of N+N is 18, and the only single-digit number that can satisfy this is 1. So \\( P = 1 \\).\n\n3. Considering the units digit (R+R must end in E and possibly carry over 1 from the next significant place), we need to account for possible values of R and E.\n\n4. Since \\( N \\geq 5 \\) and the sum of two identical numbers must carry over, we explore values considering \\( P = 1 \\).\n\nLet's work through these constraints:\n\n- \\( N = 5 \\) implies \\( NUMBER = 5xxxx \\) and \\( 5xxxx + 5xxxx = PUZZLE \\). The leading digit P = 1, so \\( 1 \\) should be carried over from the leading digit addition \\( 5 + 5 = 10 \\).\n- With \\( P = 1 \\) and \\( N = 5 \\), \\( U = 0 \\) to make \\( 1xxxx \\).\n- \\( U = 0 \\) because the first digit sum (5 + 5) leads to \\( 10 \\) (carry 1).\n\nNow let's assign values:\n\n- \\( U = 0 \\),\n- \\( P = 1 \\),\n- \\( N = 5 \\).\n\nThen, we further analyze possible values for remaining digits:\n\nConsidering the constraints and continuing:\n\n\\( 5xxxx + 5xxxx = 1xxxxx \\):\n\n- \\( M = 6 \\) fits because \\( 56xxx + 56xxx = 112xxx \\), \\( M = 6 \\).\n- \\( B \\) and \\( E \\) must satisfy \\( B + B \\) considering carry from previous digit addition.\n\nThrough checking consistent additions and carry-over, we can validate as follows:\n\n- \\( B = 7 \\), \\( E = 8 \\) (ensuring \\( B = 7 + 7 = 14 \\), carry over fits next digit).\n- \\( R = 9 \\) (ensuring \\( 9 + 9 = 18 \\), last digit sums to \\( E \\) value).\n- \\( Z = 3 \\).\n\nThus the values that satisfy the equation are:\n\n- \\( N = 5 \\),\n- \\( U = 0 \\),\n- \\( M = 6 \\),\n- \\( B = 7 \\),\n- \\( E = 8 \\),\n- \\( R = 9 \\),\n- \\( P = 1 \\),\n- \\( Z = 3 \\),\n- \\( L \\) adjusts remaining calculations.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{[[N=5, U=0, M=6, B=7, E=8, R=9, P=1, Z=3, L=2]]} \\]"}

Let's apply this to the last question:\n\n### Question:\n1. The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n2. Mandy used the sugar-free diet.\n3. The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nFirst, let's determine the pounds lost by each person based on the clues:\n\n1. Mandy used the sugar-free diet.\n2. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n3. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n4. The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n5. The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n\nLet's denote the weights lost by the dieters as follows:\n- Mandy (sugar-free diet)\n- Caveman diet dieter (somewhat more than Eula)\n- Eula (either gluten-free or caveman diet)\n- Barbara (7 lbs)\n\nFrom clue 1, Mandy lost 4 more pounds than the caveman diet dieter. Since Mandy used the sugar-free diet, let's denote the caveman diet dieter's weight loss as \\( x \\). Therefore, Mandy's weight loss is \\( x + 4 \\).\n\nFrom clue 5, Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nFrom clue 3, the caveman diet dieter lost somewhat more pounds than Eula. Let's denote Eula's weight loss as \\( y \\). Therefore, the caveman diet dieter's weight loss \\( x \\) is more than \\( y \\).\n\nSince Mandy's weight loss is \\( x + 4 \\), and we know that \\( x \\) is more than \\( y \\), we can infer that \\( x + 4 \\) is also more than \\( y \\).\n\nGiven that Barbara lost 7 lbs, we can conclude:\n- Barbara's weight loss is 7 lbs.\n- Eula's weight loss \\( y \\) is less than \\( x \\), which is the caveman diet dieter's weight loss.\n- Mandy's weight loss is \\( x + 4 \\).\n\nSince Eula's weight loss \\( y \\) is less than the caveman diet dieter's weight loss \\( x \\), and Barbara lost 7 lbs, Eula must have lost less than 7 lbs. The only integer less than 7 that fits the sequence (3, 5, 7, 9) is 3. Therefore, Eula lost 3 lbs.\n\nNow, the caveman diet dieter lost somewhat more than Eula, so \\( x \\) must be 5 lbs (since it's the next integer in the sequence).\n\nFinally, Mandy's weight loss is \\( x + 4 \\), which is 5 + 4 = 9 lbs.\n\nThus, the dieters and their weight losses are:\n- Eula lost 3 lbs (gluten-free diet)\n- Caveman diet dieter lost 5 lbs\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs\n- Mandy lost 9 lbs (sugar-free diet)\n\nArranging the entries in ascending order of pounds lost:\n\n[[3 Eula gluten-free, 5 Caveman caveman, 7 Barbara 7, 9 Mandy sugar-free]]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[3 Eula gluten-free, 5 Caveman caveman, 7 Barbara , 9 Mandy sugar-free]]"}

Since there are only four prices and these need to be ascending.\n\n2. **Inez must be the highest payer, so Inez pays $180 and thus Debra pays $170.**\n\n3. **Misty’s client must therefore be $20 more than Debra ($170 + $20 = $190)**, but since we only have $180 and there must be a price gap, let's re-prioritize:\n    - Misty’s client must pay $190 (not possible because of the prices).\n\n4. **If Inez pays $180, meanwhile, If Inez’s price is $170, Misty’s client is $190 (not listed!)**.\n\nUsing logical reasoning:\n- **Inez pays $180**.\n- **Debra pays $170**.\n\n5. This leads to reconsider Nancy’s client which needs to pay more than Kara’s client. Additionally, $150 is not possible because Kara when paid less than Nancy.\n6.

Since Elaine was awarded 2 spots after the leadership badge winner, Tara must have won the leadership badge and must be second.\n3. Elaine won the first aid badge and was awarded 2 spots after the leadership badge winner (Tara), so Elaine must be third.\n4. The youngster who won the theater badge was awarded 1 spot after the scout who won the first aid badge (Elaine), so the theater badge winner must be fourth. Kendra didn't win the leadership badge, so Kendra must have won the theater badge.\n5. The only badge left is the dance badge, and the only girl left is Astrid.

Since March 10, March 24, March 17, and March 31 are taken, Zamora v Pibb must be on March 24 with the 4-5 decision.\n\n5. **From Clue 6**:\n   - The 8-1 decision was 2 weeks after the 5-4 decision.

Let's go through each clue step-by-step:\n\n1. **The client who ordered the dragon roll ordered the teriyaki roll.**\n   - This means the dragon roll and teriyaki roll are ordered by the same person.\n\n2. **Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.**\n   - This implies two scenarios:\n     - Hector paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n     - The customer who ordered the tiger roll either paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n\n3. **Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.**\n   - Either Virginia paid $15.50 and Ramona ordered the rainbow roll, or vice versa.\n\n4. **Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.**\n   - This narrows down Virginia's possible orders.\n\n5. **The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.**\n   - Keeping in mind that Virginia and Ramona are distinct from the dragon roll customer.\n\n6. **Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.**\n   - Hector must, therefore, have ordered something else.\n\n7. **The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.**\n   - This directly assigns the firecracker roll to the $9.50 price.\n\nFrom these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n- Hector is either the person who paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll, but not the teriyaki roll.\n- Virginia is either the person who paid $15.50 or ordered the rainbow roll, and she could also have ordered the spider roll.\n- The person who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll.\n\nLet's assign the prices and rolls based on these deductions:\n\n1. **$9.50 Firecracker Roll** (This is clear from clue 7.)\n2. **$11.50 Tiger Roll Futomaki Roll Hector** (Hector can't have the teriyaki roll, and one of these conditions must be true.)\n3. **$13.50 Dragon Roll Teriyaki Roll** (These two rolls are ordered by the same person, and it's not Hector.)\n4. **$15.50 Rainbow Roll (and likely Spider Roll) Virginia** (Virginia's conditions match these clues.)\n\nThe remaining roll (Rainbow or Spider) must be assigned to Ramona since Virginia and Ramona cover these two rolls separately.\n\nThus, the final assignment is:\n\n```\n[[\n$9.50 Firecracker Roll Someone,\n$11.50 Tiger Roll Futomaki Roll Hector,\n$13.50 Dragon Roll Teriyaki Roll Someone,\n$15.50 Rainbow Roll Spider Roll Virginia\n]]\n```\n\nNote: The exact assignment of \"Someone\" needs clarification with the given information, but the structure fits the requirements."}

Numbers are filled in such a way that they form a continuous sequence within each row and column.\n\nGiven the structure and other examples, let’s derive the answer for the last question by following the same pattern.\n\nWe'll start by filling in numbers in a sequential order given the constraints (sum and known values):\n\n### Question:\nX  6  X  4  23\n8  X  X  X  24\nX  X  3  X  31\n21  15  19  23\n\n#### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n1. First Row:\n   - The known elements are `6`, `4`, and the sum at the end is `23`.\n   - To find the missing numbers, calculate the sum: `23 - (6 + 4) = 13`.\n   - We need to distribute `13` into two places `X` such that they are filled in increasing order.\n   - The smallest sequence to fill would be `2` and `5` (since 1 + 3 fits the pattern of increasing sequence).\n   - Thus, the row is: `2 6 5 4 23`.\n\n2. Second Row:\n   - The known element is `8` and the sum is `24`.\n   - Calculate the sum `24 - 8 = 16`.\n   - We need three numbers adding up to `16` that are in increasing order and not repeated.\n   - A sequence fitting is `1` (smallest unused), `3`, `1`, `4` (is invalid as numbers can’t be repeated).\n   - Correctly 1, 7 (new number) and 8 (final).\n   - Thus, the row is: `8 1 7 8 24`.\n\n3. Third Row:\n   - The known number is `3` with the sum at `31`.\n   - Calculate `31 - 3 = 28`.\n   - Now fill with remaining numbers in sequence fitting sum: `9 (next smallest unused), 10, 3, 12 designating sum correct`.\n   -  Thus, the row is: `9 10 3 12`.\n\n4.

Follow the pattern by filling the grid row by row, left to right, skipping already given numbers.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n  ```\n  15  4  1  3  28\n  5  6  2  10  24\n  7  11  8  9  44\n  13  12  14  1  40\n  43  32  38  23\n  ```\n\nNow, let's put it in the required format:\n\n  ```\n  [[15 4 1 3 28,5 6 2 10 24,7 11 8 9 44,13 12 14 1 40,43 32 38 23]]\n  ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\n[[15 4 1 3 28,5 6 2 10 24,7 11 8 9 44,13 12 14 1 40,43 32 38 23]]\n```"}

The previous examples suggest that the numbers are being filled sequentially from the smallest available number, and the largest number in the last row gives a clue about the range of numbers involved.\n\nLet's analyze the structure:\n\n1. The numbers in each row and column typically go from the smallest to the largest.\n2. We start filling in the \"X\" spaces with the smallest available number not already present in the grid.\n\nGiven the grid:\n\n```\n7  X  X  16  46\n6  5  X  X  21\nX  X  1  12  20\n11  15  X  X  49\n28  36  22  50\n```\n\nWe need to fill in the \"X\" spaces with the numbers that are missing from the sequence.\n\nFor the first row:\n- The missing numbers between 7 and 16 are 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15. Since 15 is already in the grid, we use the next available: 13, 14.\n\nFor the second row:\n- The missing numbers between 5 and 21, excluding those already in the grid are 17, 18, 19, 20. Since 20 is already there, the next available numbers are 17, 18.\n\nFor the third row:\n- The missing numbers before 1 and after 12 that are not already in the grid are 2, 3, 4. Since 4 is not taken, we have 2, 3.\n\nFor the fourth row:\n- The missing numbers between 11 and 15 are 12, which is already taken. The next available numbers in the sequence are 13, 14 which are already used. So, we use 23, 24.\n\nFor the fifth row:\n- All numbers are present.\n\nFinally, filling in the \"X\" spaces:\n\n```\n7  13  14  16  46\n6   5  17  18  21\n2   3   1  12  20\n11  15  23  24  49\n28  36  22  50\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```\n[[7 13 14 16 46,6 5 17 18 21,2 3 1 12 20,11 15 23 24 49,28 36 22 50]]\n```\n\nSo the filled grid in the required format is:\n\n```\n[[7 13 14 16 46,6 5 17 18 21,2 3 1 12 20,11 15 23 24 49,28 36 22 50]]\n```"}

The X’s in each grid need to be replaced by numbers in a specific sequence.\n3.

Given:\n```\nX  X  X  X  14\n4  X  X  X  27\nX  9  X  X  41\nX  X  X  X  54\n23  29  33  51\n```\n\nLet's observe the sequence:\n```\nFor the first row, starting with values, we fill:\n3 6 7 11 | 14\n4 5 8 12 | 27\n7 9 10 15 | 41\n13  14  16  17 | 54\n23  29  33  51\n```\n\nFollowing the pattern, we need to fill in the numbers in a similar zigzag or diagonal pattern:\n\n1. 1 2 3 4 10\n2. 7 5 6 8 14\n3. 9 11 12 14 19\n4. 13 15 16 17\n\nThus, the numbers should be filled as follows:\n```\n3 6 7 11 14\n4 5 8 12 27\n7 9 10 15 41\n13 14 16 17 54\n23 29 33 51\n```\n\nTherefore, the sequence for the last question is:\n\n```\n[[2 1 3 7 4,5 6 8 12 9,10 1 1 15 14]]\n[[1 2 3 4 10,7 5 6 8 14,9 11 12 14 19,13 15 16 17]]\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n[[1 2 3 4 10,7 5 6 8 14,9 11 12 14 19,13 15 16 17]]"}

The \"X\" fills in the other spots.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the new question:\n\n### Question:\n```\nX  X  X  X  2\nX  X  X  X  9\nX  X  X  X  6\nX  X  X  X  6\n4  10  6  5\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **First Line:** Corresponds to `2`, meaning \"1\" is placed in the second position.\n   ```\n   X 1 X X\n   ```\n\n2. **Second Line:** Corresponds to `9`, but since 9 exceeds 4, it cycles as 9 % 4 = 1 (since there are 4 columns).\n   ```\n   1 X X X\n   ```\n\n3. **Third Line:** Corresponds to `6`, so 6 % 4 = 2 (since there are 4 columns).\n   ```\n   X 1 X X\n   ```\n\n4. **Fourth Line:** Corresponds to `6`, so 6 % 4 = 2 (since there are 4 columns).\n   ```\n   X 1 X X\n   ```\n\n### Final Result:\n```\n[[X 1 X X,1 X X X,X 1 X X,X 1 X X]]\n```\n\nSo, the answer wrapped in double square brackets is:\n```\n[[X 1 X X,1 X X X,X 1 X X,X 1 X X]]\n```"}

First row has 1 'X': Let's place it in the first column (since the first column needs the most 'X's).\n2. Second row has 4 'X's: Place 'X's in the first three columns and one additional 'X' in any column (can choose the one that needs more 'X's, i.e., the third column).\n3. Third row has 3 'X's: Place 'X's in the first two columns and one additional 'X' in any column (can choose the one that needs more 'X's, i.e., the third column).\n4. Fourth row has 6 'X's: This means all columns must have 'X's and one column must have two 'X's (can choose the one that needs more 'X's, i.e., the third column twice).\n\nChecking the columns:\n- First column should have 5 'X's.\n- Second column should have 4 'X's.\n- Third column should have 7 'X's.\n- Fourth column should have 2 'X's.\n\nFilling the grid accordingly:\n\nX  X  X  X\n1  X  X  X\n1  1  X  X\nX  X  X  X\n\n### Answer:\n[[X X 1 X,1 X X X,1 1 X X,X X X X]]"}

The grid typically forms a specific number sequence or pattern.\n2. The numbers in the grid follow a logical numerical progression.\n3. The patterns might involve either increasing or decreasing sequences, sometimes altering directions or following a specific path.\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\nLet's examine the provided grid:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nX  35  34  43  42  47  50  51  X\nX  32  X  X  X  X  X  56  X\nX  29  X  X  X  X  X  79  X\nX  22  X  X  X  X  X  80  X\nX  19  X  X  X  X  X  81  X\nX  2  X  X  X  X  X  X  70  X\nX  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n\n#### Step 1: Fill the First Row\n\nSince we don't have any provided numbers in the first row, let's assume it fills sequentially, and find a pattern that fits those numbers:\n\n```\n0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 // Pattern not identifiable from the given numbers directly\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Examine the Second Row\n\nThe numbers are:\n```\nX  35  34  43  42  47  50  51  X\n```\n\nHere, the sequence seems to be defined but only partially visible.\n\n#### Step 3: Fill the Remaining Gaps in Each Row\n\nWe start by identifying the given sequences and determining their progression rules. For example, filling the blanks based on visible number contexts:\n\nTo give a consistent pattern, where possible numbers are:\n\n1. By moving numbers similarly to neighboring completed sequences\n2. Follow increasing/decreasing within seen patterns\n\nFinal answer assuming an increasing/decreasing or alternating established sequence, noting logical step gaps consistent with original identified step patterns\n\n```\n0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8,\n1  35  34  40  41  42  43  44  45,\n2  31  30  39  38  37  36  35  56,\n3  28  27  26  25  24  23  22  79,\n4  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  80,\n5  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  81,\n6  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  70,\n7  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  72,\n8  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n```\n\nWrapping, final answer to follow observed pattern structure:\n\n[[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8,1 35 34 40 41 42 43 44 45,2 31 30 39 38 37 36 35 56,3 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 79,4 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 80,5 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 81,6 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 70,7 1 8 11 14 65 68 71 72,8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]"}

By observing the first three examples, we can see that diagonals have increasing sequences in alternating directions in some cases, or are created by systematic reordering.\n\nLet's analyze and solve the last grid:\n\nGiven grid:\n```\n11  X  7  X  3  X  81  X  77\nX  9  X  5  X  1  X  79  X\n13  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  75\nX  21  X  X  X  X  X  73  X\n23  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  71\nX  35  X  X  X  X  X  59  X\n37  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  69\nX  41  X  31  X  49  X  67  X\n43  X  45  X  47  X  63  X  65\n```\n\nTo find the solution, we need to first establish numbers in diagonals. Observing the transition from diagonals in the previous grids, we can infer alternating order in these sequences.\n\nLet’s start filling the diagonals:\n- The first diagonal sequence starting from the top-left corner:\n    - Already filled as 11\n- The next diagonal starting from 9:\n    - 11, 9, 21 must start an increasing sequence.\n- Continuing this logic, let's fill in each diagonal:\n\nCompleting the diagonal sequences and filling the grid based on observed patterns:\n```\n11  21  7  23  3   35  81  37  77\n31  9   25  5   32  1   39  79  41\n13  29  27  28  24  33  30  36  75\n53  21  26  22  20  29  40  73  38\n23  51  17  18  16  15  34  31  71\n19  35  13  14  12  11  42  59  19\n37  43  10  9   8   7   44  24  69\n79  41  31  2   6   4   40  67  53\n43  45  47  49  51  52  63  47  65\n```\n\nLet's proceed row by row:\n```\n11 21 7 23 3 35 81 37 77,\n31 9 25 5 32 1 39 79 41,\n13 29 27 28 24 33 30 36 75,\n53 21 26 22 20 29 40 73 38,\n23 51 17 18 16 15 34 31 71,\n19 35 13 14 12 11 42 59 19,\n37 43 10 9 8 7 44 24 69,\n79 41 31 2 6 4 40 67 53,\n43 45 47 49 51 52 63 47 65\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n```\n[[11 21 7 23 3 35 81 37 77, 31 9 25 5 32 1 39 79 41, 13 29 27 28 24 33 30 36 75, 53 21 26 22 20 29 40 73 38, 23 51 17 18 16 15 34 31 71, 19 35 13 14 12 11 42 59 19, 37 43 10 9 8 7 44 24 69, 79 41 31 2 6 4 40 67 53, 43 45 47 49 51 52 63 47 65]]\n```\nWrap the final answer:\n```\n[[11 21 7 23 3 35 81 37 77, 31 9 25 5 32 1 39 79 41, 13 29 27 28 24 33 30 36 75, 53 21 26 22 20 29 40 73 38, 23 51 17 18 16 15 34 31 71, 19 35 13 14 12 11 42 59 19, 37 43 10 9 8 7 44 24 69, 79 41 31 2 6 4 40 67 53, 43 45 47 49 51 52 63 47 65]]\n```"}

Here’s the approach to solve the given problem:\n\n1. The numbers in the grid are laid out in a way that missing numbers are filled in decreasing order moving up the grid, and increasing order moving down the grid.\n2. For the given grid, numbers are already filled in a certain sequence, and the missing numbers need to be filled to maintain the pattern.\n\nFollowing this logic, let’s fill in the missing numbers and complete the grid:\n\nOriginal grid for reference:\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nX  53  58  65  64  63  78  77  X\nX  52  X  X  X  X  X  76  X\nX  49  X  X  X  X  X  75  X\nX  14  X  X  X  X  X  40  X\nX  11  X  X  X  X  X  41  X\nX  2  X  X  X  X  X  X  36  X\nX  1  8  21  24  29  28  35  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n\nLet’s fill in the grid:\n\n1. Start filling from the top row:\n```\n59 57 55 54 56 60 61 79 72\n```\n2. Fill the next rows sequentially:\n```\n53  58  65  64  63  78  77  80  71\n52  51  48  47  46  45  76  73  70\n49  44  43  42  38  37  75  69  68\n14  13  12  10  9   8   40  67  66\n11  10  9   7   6   5   41  64  63\n2   1   4   3   6   7   33  36  62\n1   8   21  24  29  28  35  34  60\n70 68 67 66 64 63 61 59 57\n```\n\nCombining all rows:\n\n```\n57 55 54 56 59 60 61 79 72,\n53 58 65 64 63 78 77 80 71,\n52 51 48 47 46 45 76 73 70,\n49 44 43 42 38 37 75 69 68,\n14 13 12 10 9 8 40 67 66,\n11 10 9 7 6 5 41 64 63,\n2 1 4 3 6 7 33 36 62,\n1 8 21 24 29 28 35 34 60,\n70 68 67 66 64 63 61 59 57\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\n[[57 55 54 56 59 60 61 79 72, 53 58 65 64 63 78 77 80 71, 52 51 48 47 46 45 76 73 70, 49 44 43 42 38 37 75 69 68, 14 13 12 10 9 8 40 67 66, 11 10 9 7 6 5 41 64 63, 2 1 4 3 6 7 33 36 62, 1 8 21 24 29 28 35 34 60, 70 68 67 66 64 63 61 59 57]]\n```"}

From the provided examples, it seems that the numbers follow a specific pattern or sequence that can be inferred from the given filled numbers.\n\nHere’s the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Known Values:**\n   - The first row, last row, and part of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh rows contain known values.\n\n2. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - Observe the known values to infer patterns in the columns and order.\n\n3. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Based on the inferred patterns, fill in the missing values sequentially.\n\n### Observation from Given Data:\n- The first row is in acending then descending orders: 19, 18, 11, 10, 79, 80, 73, 72, 71.\n- The last row and the first column follow an increasing or decreasing order.\n- The numbers in the middle rows should likely follow a serialized sequence, either increasing or decreasing.\n\n### Inferred Pattern:\n- To maintain consistency, start with the known values and fill in incrementing or decrementing patterns as needed.\n\n#### Filled Grid:\n1. Row 1: 19, 18, 11, 10, 79, 80, 73, 72, 71\n2. Row 2: 20, 17, 12, 9, 78, 77, 76, 74, 70\n3. Row 3: 21, 16, 13, 8, 75, 74, 73, 72, 69\n4. Row 4: 22, 15, 14, 7, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68\n5. Row 5: 23, 14, 13, 6, 61, 60, 59, 58, 67\n6. Row 6: 30, 12, 18, 5, 54, 55, 56, 57, 62\n7. Row 7: 31, 11, 4, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 61\n8. Row 8: 38, 10, 3, 54, 51, 48, 47, 46, 56\n9. Row 9: 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 52, 53, 54, 55\n\nTherefore, the final filled grid is:\n\n```\n[[19 18 11 10 79 80 73 72 71,20 17 12 9 78 77 76 74 70,21 16 13 8 75 74 73 72 69,22 15 14 7 62 63 64 65 68,23 14 13 6 61 60 59 58 67,30 12 18 5 54 55 56 57 62,31 11 4 53 52 51 50 49 61,38 10 3 54 51 48 47 46 56,39 40 41 42 43 52 53 54 55]]\n```\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[19 18 11 10 79 80 73 72 71,20 17 12 9 78 77 76 74 70,21 16 13 8 75 74 73 72 69,22 15 14 7 62 63 64 65 68,23 14 13 6 61 60 59 58 67,30 12 18 5 54 55 56 57 62,31 11 4 53 52 51 50 49 61,38 10 3 54 51 48 47 46 56,39 40 41 42 43 52 53 54 55]]\n```"}

The numbers increase or decrease by 1 in a stepped manner either horizontally or vertically.\n2. The pattern often involves alternate rows increasing while others decrease, or vice versa.\n3. The numbers seem to fill in a snake-like pattern where the direction changes at each row.\n\nLet's apply these rules to fill in the numbers for the last question:\n\n### Question:\n```\nX X X X X X X X X X\nX 55 X 63 X 79 X 81 X\nX X 57 X 65 X 71 X X\nX 49 X X X X X X 11 X\nX X 45 X X X X 9 X X\nX 41 X X X X X X 15 X\nX X 39 X 21 X 19 X X\nX 1 X 3 X 23 X 25 X\nX X X X X X X X X X\n```\n\n### Answer:\nApplying the observed rules:\n\n1. Row 1 fills from left to right with increasing numbers.\n2. Row 2 fills in alternating directions but maintaining an overall pattern in order.\n3. Row 3 does similarly, and so on.\n\nGiven the layout and the numbers provided:\n\n```\n73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64\n74 55 76 63 78 79 80 81 82 62\n75 77 57 61 65 72 71 70 69 60\n79 49 78 83 84 85 86 11 59 58\n80 81 45 82 87 86 85 9 57 56\n83 41 82 81 88 77 76 15 55 54\n84 83 39 75 21 73 19 53 52 51\n85 1 84 3 74 23 25 50 49 48\n86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95\n```\n\nThus, the filled-in grid becomes:\n\n```\n[[73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64, 74 55 76 63 78 79 80 81 82 62, 75 77 57 61 65 72 71 70 69 60, 79 49 78 83 84 85 86 11 59 58, 80 81 45 82 87 86 85 9 57 56, 83 41 82 81 88 77 76 15 55 54, 84 83 39 75 21 73 19 53 52 51, 85 1 84 3 74 23 25 50 49 48, 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95]]\n```\n\n[[73 72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64, 74 55 76 63 78 79 80 81 82 62, 75 77 57 61 65 72 71 70 69 60, 79 49 78 83 84 85 86 11 59 58, 80 81 45 82 87 86 85 9 57 56, 83 41 82 81 88 77 76 15 55 54, 84 83 39 75 21 73 19 53 52 51, 85 1 84 3 74 23 25 50 49 48, 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95]]"}

Let's assume one possible distinct initial arrangement for reference:\n   ```\n   1  2  3  4\n   5  6  7  8\n   9 10 11 12\n   13 14 15 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply the Operations:**\n   Now we follow the operations mentioned:\n\n   - **(1,1)(2,1): 5+**\n     - Result: 1 + 5 = 6 becomes (1,1) and 5 + 5 = 10 becomes (2,1)\n\n   - **(1,2)(1,3): 5+**\n     - Result: 2 + 5 = 7 becomes (1,2) and 3 + 5 = 8 becomes (1,3)\n\n   - **(2,2)(2,3): 2÷**\n     - Result: 6 ÷ 2 = 3 becomes (2,2) and 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5, let's assume it should stay as 7 becomes (2,3)\n\n   - **(3,4)(4,4): 2÷**\n     - Result: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 becomes (3,4) and 16 ÷ 2 = 8 becomes (4,4)\n\n   - **(1,4)(2,4): 1-**\n     - Result: 4 - 1 = 3 becomes (1,4) and 8 - 1 = 7 becomes (2,4)\n\n   - **(4,1)(4,2): 1-**\n     - Result: 13 - 1 = 12 becomes (4,1) and 14 - 1 = 13 becomes (4,2)\n\n   - **(3,1)(3,2): 12*\n     - Result: 9 * 12 = 108 becomes (3,1) and 10 * 12 = 120 becomes (3,2)\n\n   - **(3,3)(4,3): 4*\n     - Result: 11 * 4 becomes 44 as (3,3) and 15 * 4 = 60 becomes (4,3)\n\n   After correcting for mistakes and recalculating using exact arithmetic results, the fixed adjusted steps based on problem interpretation give these values:\n\nWhile following arithmetic operations strictly, the implemented results are converted to sequence 1 through 16 precisely:\n- **(1,1):6**\n- **(2,1):10**\n- **(3,4):6**\n- **(4,4):8**\n- maintain proper non-repeating numbers applying rearrangement for unique numbers rearrangement for a resolution latest revised transformation accurately:\n\nThus final fixed matrix:\n\n3. **Final Arrangement:**\n\nHere is the grid with values placed according to rules derived:\n```\n4  3  2  1\n2  4  3  1\n1  2  4  3\n3  1  2  4\n```\nConverting this to the required output format:\n```plaintext\n[[4 3 2 1,2 4 3 1,1 2 4 3,3 1 2 4]]\n```\n\nHence, the answer is:\n```plaintext\n[[4 3 2 1,2 4 3 1,1 2 4 3,3 1 2 4]]\n```"}

We need to apply the given operations to these cells.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n1. (1,1)(1,2):4* -> Multiply the 4th cell * 4.\n2. (1,3)(1,4):1- -> Subtract 1 from the 1st cell.\n3. (2,1)(3,1)(3,2):8+ -> Add 8 to the 8th cell + 8.\n4. (2,2)(2,3)(3,3)(4,3):12+ -> Add 12 to the 12th cell + 12.\n5. (2,4)(3,4)(4,4):8* -> Multiply the 8th cell * 8.\n6.

Let's analyze the provided comparisons and deduce the values.\n\nGiven comparisons:\n1. (1,3) < (1,4)\n2. (1,4) < (2,4)\n3. (2,4) < (3,4)\n4. (2,1) < (2,2)\n\nLet's start by figuring out the values for the first row:\n\n1. (1,3) < (1,4) implies that the value at (1,3) is less than the value at (1,4).\n2. Since (1,4) is less than (2,4) and (2,4) is less than (3,4), we can establish the order in column 4.\n\nFrom the information given and basic reasoning:\n- (1,4) is less than (2,4) and (2,4) is less than (3,4), so (1,4), (2,4), and (3,4) are in ascending order.\n- Also, (2,1) < (2,2) gives us a partial order for row 2.\n\nTo determine the order of elements, let's assign some values considering the order constraints:\n\nAssuming the first row is partially filled with 1 and 4 in columns 3 and 4 based on comparison:\n- Column 3: (1,3) < (2,3) < (3,3)\n- Column 4: (1,4) < (2,4) < (3,4)\n\nUsing these constraints and ensuring the grid elements are unique from 1 to 4 within each row and column, let's assign values:\n\nStart with the first row:\n- (1,3) < (1,4), let's assume (1,3) = 1 and (1,4) = 2.\n- (2,1) < (2,2), let's assume (2,1) = 1 and (2,2) = 3.\n\nFrom (2,4) < (3,4):\n- Assign (2,4) = 2. Since (3,4) > (2,4), assume (3,4) = 4.\n\nBuilding the grid:\n\n- Row 1: Starting point with 3. Assign (1,2) < (1,3) < (1,4). Let's assume (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) as 1, 2, 4 respectively.\n- Row 2: Follow the partial order given by (2,1) < (2,2).\n- Row 3: Account for given 2 at (3,3) and ensure all other constraints.\n- Row 4: Use remaining values following constraints.\n\nThus filling the grid:\n\n```plaintext\n3 1 2 4\n1 3 4 2\n4 2 1 3\n2 4 3 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[3 1 2 4,1 3 4 2,4 2 1 3,2 4 3 1]]"}

Let's start by listing the given inequalities and gathering their implications:\n\n1. `(1,4)<(2,4)`: Means in column 4, the number in the first row is less than the number in the second row.\n2. `(2,2)<(2,3)`: Means in row 2, the number in column 2 is less than the number in column 3.\n3. `(3,2)>(4,2)`: Means in column 2, the number in the third row is greater than the number in the fourth row.\n4. `(3,1)>(3,4)`: Means in row 3, the number in column 1 is greater than the number in column 4.\n5. `(3,4)>(4,4)`: Means in column 4, the number in the third row is greater than the number in the fourth row.\n\nNow, let's start filling the grid with the provided information and inequalities.\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n2 X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n```\n\nGiven the above rules, we can start deducing the elements:\n\n1. Since `(3,1)>(3,4)`, `(3,4)>(4,4)`, and `(3,2)>(4,2)`, we know that the third row's first element is the highest in row 3, and the fourth row's second element is the lowest comparing pairs.\n\n2. According to `(2,2)<(2,3)`, it implies 2nd row, 2nd column is less than 2nd row, 3rd column.\n\nHere's the deduction step by step:\n\n**Step-by-step deduction:**\n- `(1,4)<(2,4)`: So first row, 4th column is less than second row, 4th column.\n- `(2,2)<(2,3)`: 2nd row, 2nd column is less than 2nd row, 3rd column.\n- `(3,2)>(4,2)`: 3rd row, 2nd column is greater than the 4th row, 2nd column.\n- `(3,1)>(3,4)`: 3rd row, 1st column (let's call this `a`) is greater than 3rd row, 4th column (let's call this `b`).\n- `(3,4)>(4,4)`: 3rd row, 4th column is greater than 4th row, 4th column.\n\nGiven:\n   - `(3,1) = a > (3,4) = b > (4,4)`\n   - And `(3,2) > (4,2)`\n\n**From the inequalities, we carry on:**\n1st row, 4th column < 2nd row, 4th column. Say 2nd row, 4th column = 4.\nThen:\n- 3rd row has order based on various inequalities and placements.\n\n```\n2 X X <2nd row\nX X X <2nd row\n>4th row, > 1st row\n1st row <4th row\n```\n\nFilling all these transitions and constraints into the grid, we get:\n\n`2nd row 3rd` column greater, first row placement leading:\n\nResults give:\n\n```\n2  4  1  3\n4  2  3  1\n3  1  4  2\n1  3  2  4\n```\nThus:\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n[[2 4 1 3,4 2 3 1,3 1 4 2,1 3 2 4]]\n```"}

From \\( (1,2) > (1,3) \\) and knowing that there are only two places left in the first row (since 2 is already given as the first element and 3 is at (4,4)):\n   - The possible numbers in row 1 are 1 or 4 for positions (1,2) and (1,3) respectively. So, \\( (1,2) = 4 \\) and \\( (1,3) = 1 \\).\n\n2. From \\( (2,2) > (2,3) \\) similar logic applies:\n   - The possible numbers in row 2 for (2,2) and (2,3) are 4 or 1 respectively. So, \\( (2,2) = 1 \\) and \\( (2,3) = 4 \\).\n\n3. From \\( (3,1) < (3,2) \\):\n   - Row 3 has only one element left for \\( (3,1) \\) and it should be less than \\( (3,2) \\). The only missing number is 4, so \\( (3,2) = 4 \\). Thus, \\( (3,1) = 1 \\).\n\n4. Finally, \\( (4,4) = 3 \\) is given. The rest of the numbers can now be filled in by ensuring all numbers from 1 to 4 appear exactly once in each row and column.\n\nLet's fill the grid accordingly:\n- For (1,4) the only available number is 3. So, \\( (1,4) = 3 \\).\n- For (2,1), (2,4): Using the remaining numbers, \\( (2,1) = 3 \\) (since 1 and 4 are taken) and (2,4) = 2.\n- For (3,3), (3,4): The only remaining numbers are 2 and 3, respectively. Thus, \\( (3,3) = 2 \\) and \\( (3,4) = 3 \\).\n- For (4,1) to (4,3): The remaining numbers for each place, except (4,4) which is already 3, are filled in as 2, \\( (4,2) = 1 \\), \\( (4,3) = 4 \\).\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 2 4\n1 4 2 3\n4 2 1 3\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[[2 4 1 3, 3 1 2 4, 1 4 2 3, 4 2 1 3]]"}

From (1,4) < (1,5):\n   - (1,5) should be greater than (1,4).\n\n2. From (1,2) < (2,2):\n   - (2,2) is greater than (1,2).\n\n3. From (2,3) < (3,3):\n   - (3,3) is greater than (2,3).\n\n4. From (3,4) > (4,4):\n   - (3,4) is greater than (4,4).\n\n5. From (4,1) > (4,2):\n   - (4,1) (which is 4) is greater than (4,2).\n\n6. From (4,3) < (5,3):\n   - (5,3) is greater than (4,3).\n\n7.

(1,4) < (1,5) implies:\n   - (1,4) = X, (1,5) = X\n\n2. (1,2) < (2,2) implies:\n   - (1,2) = 2, (2,2) = 3 (and (2,2) cannot be 4 or higher as other constraints must be valid)\n\n3.

Let's start by analyzing the given comparisons:\n\n1. (1,4) > (1,5) => 4 > X (where X is the element in (1, 5))\n2. (1,2) > (2,2) => X > X (where Xs are the elements in (1, 2) and (2, 2))\n3. (2,5) < (3,5) => X < X (where Xs are the elements in (2, 5) and (3, 5))\n4. (3,4) > (3,5) => X > X (where Xs are the elements in (3, 4) and (3, 5))\n5. (4,4) > (4,5) => X > X (where Xs are the elements in (4, 4) and (4, 5))\n6. (4,3) < (4,4) => X < X (where Xs are the elements in (4, 3) and (4, 4))\n7. (5,3) > (5,4) => X > X (where Xs are the elements in (5, 3) and (5, 4))\n\nTo fill the grid, we need to determine the values of X in each position that satisfy the given comparisons. Notice that the comparisons only help directly with certain positions in the grid, so we'll use them to guide our placement of numbers ensuring all the specified relationships are maintained.\n\nWe can start by placing the given 4 in its position and work from there:\n\nGrid layout:\n```\nX X X 4 X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n```\n\nFollowing the logic and inferences required from each comparison, we obtain the following grid:\n\n```\n1 5 3 4 2\n3 1 2 5 4\n2 4 1 3 5\n5 2 4 1 3\n4 3 5 2 1\n```\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. (1,4) = 4, so place 4 in (1,4).\n2. (1,4) > (1,5) => 4 > X => X can be 1, 2, or 3. Let's choose 2 for simplicity. (1,5) = 2.\n3. (1,2) > (2,2) => pick lower values for (2,2) to maintain the inequality, let's say (1,2) = 5 and (2,2) = 1.\n4. (2,5) < (3,5) => pick values such that this holds, maybe (2,5) = 4 and (3,5) = 5.\n5. (3,4) > (3,5) => pick a smaller value than 4 to (3,5), let's say (3,4) = 1 and move 5 to (3,5).\n6. (4,4) > (4,5) => same argument so (4,4) might be higher and (4,5) lower.\n7. (4,3) < (4,4) => makes (4,3) smaller.\n8. (5,3) > (5,4) => (5,3) is bigger than (5,4).\n\nBy sequentially checking and filling cells with the proper constraint checks, we come to the final grid:\n\n```\n[[1 5 3 4 2, 3 1 2 5 4, 2 4 1 3 5, 5 2 4 1 3, 4 3 5 2 1]]\n```\n\nThus, our final answer is:\n\n```\n[[1 5 3 4 2, 3 1 2 5 4, 2 4 1 3 5, 5 2 4 1 3, 4 3 5 2 1]]\n```"}

Arrows typically point in the following manner:\n   - '→': Right\n   - '←': Left\n   - '↑': Up\n   - '↓': Down\n3. If there are multiple numbers in the vicinity, the direction is usually chosen based on the nearest or most influential number.\n\nUsing these rules, let's decode the provided grid:\n\n### Grid:\n```\nX X 3 X X X X 8\nX 7 X X X X X X\nX X X X X X 9 X\nX X X X 3 X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X\n7 X X 1 X X X X\nX X X X X 7 X X\nX X X 4 X X X X\n```\n\n### Steps to determine arrows:\n\n1. Start from the first row and work in a left-to-right manner.\n2. For each \"X\", check the surrounding numbers and determine the arrow direction.\n3. Repeat for each row until all \"X\"s are replaced.\n\n### Decoded Grid:\n\n```\n← ← 3 → → → → 8\n← 7 ↑ → → → → →\n↓ ↑ ↓ ← ↑ ↑ 9 →\n↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 3 ↓ ↓ ↓\n↑ ← 5 ↑ → → ↓ ↑\n7 → ← 1 → ← → ↑\n↓ ← ← ← ↓ 7 → →\n↓ ← ← 4 ↔ → ←\n```\n\n### Formatting the answer:\n\nEnsure the formatting matches the example, with elements separated by spaces and rows separated by commas.\n\n```\n[[← ← 3 → → → → 8, ← 7 ↑ → → → → →, ↓ ↑ ↓ ← ↑ ↑ 9 →, ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 3 ↓ ↓ ↓, ↑ ← 5 ↑ → → ↓ ↑, 7 → ← 1 → ← → ↑, ↓ ← ← ← ↓ 7 → →, ↓ ← ← 4 ↔ → ←]]\n```\n\nThus, the final formatted answer is:\n\n```\n[[← ← 3 → → → → 8, ← 7 ↑ → → → → →, ↓ ↑ ↓ ← ↑ ↑ 9 →, ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 3 ↓ ↓ ↓, ↑ ← 5 ↑ → → ↓ ↑, 7 → ← 1 → ← → ↑, ↓ ← ← ← ↓ 7 → →, ↓ ← ← 4 ↔ → ←]]\n```"}

Each digit is replaced with an arrow or directional marker:\n   - Numbers greater than 5 are replaced with '→'.\n   - Numbers equal to or less than 5 are replaced with '←'.\n2. 'X' either represents a blank space or a directional marker.\n\nFor clarification, let's break down the directional markers based on the provided examples:\n\n- If the number 'X' is surrounded by numbers higher or lower, 'X' gets directional markers accordingly:\n  - 'X' surrounded by higher values generally points downwards (↓).\n  - 'X' surrounded by lower values generally points upwards (↑).\n\nApplying this reasoning to the new question:\n\n```\n1 X X 6 X X 5 X X\nX X X X X X X 7 X\n7 X X X X X 5 X 1\nX X 6 X X X X X X\nX X X X X 3 X X 1\nX 7 X X X X X X X\nX X X X X 1 X X 2\nX X X X 9 X X X X\nX X X 5 X X X X X\n```\n\nWorking step by step:\n\n1.

From the provided examples, it seems that each number is surrounded by arrows based on its position relative to the symbols 'X' and other numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the direction of arrows around each number**:\n   - If there is a number to the left, the arrow to the left of the current number points right. Conversely, if there is an 'X', it points left.\n   - Similarly, for other directions:\n     - Above: points up if there is a number, down if there is an 'X'.\n     - Right: points left if there is a number, right if there is an 'X'.\n     - Below: points down if there is a number, up if there is an 'X'.\n\n2. **Apply these rules to all the positions in the grid**.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the given grid:\n\n```\nX X X X X X X 8 X 9\nX 1 X 1 X X 4 X 1 X\nX X 6 X 6 X X X X X\nX 2 X X X 4 X X 1 X\n4 X X X X X X X X X\nX X X 2 X X 4 X X X\nX X 1 X 2 X X 1 X X\n2 X X 1 X X X X X X\nX 8 X X X X X X 2 X\nX X 2 X 1 X 3 X X X\n```\n\nWe will generate the arrows step by step.

The rules specify that we must output the coordinates of each unique letter in the grid, in alphabetical order. If there are multiple instances of a character, we choose the coordinates with the smallest row number first, and if the row numbers are the same, we choose the one with the smallest column number. Each character's coordinates should be formatted and separated by a line breaker.\n\nGiven the grid:\n\n```\nA        A        A        A        A        A        A        A        A        A\nA        A        A        A        C        C        A        A        A        A\nB        B        A        B        B        C        C        C        C        D\nB        B        B        B        B        J        C        C        D        D\nB        B        B        B        E        J        C        C        C        D\nB        F        F        B        E        J        C        C        C        C\nF        F        F        E        E        J        G        C        G        C\nF        F        F        E        E        G        G        G        G        H\nF        F        F        I        I        I        I        H        H        H\nF        F        F        I        I        I        I        H        H        H\n```\n\nLet's find the coordinates for each letter:\n\n- **A:** The smallest row is 1 and the smallest column is 1. So, A(1,1).\n- **B:** The smallest row is 3 and the smallest column is 1. So, B(3,1).\n- **C:** The smallest row is 2 and the smallest column is 6. So, C(2,6).\n- **D:** The smallest row is 3 and the smallest column is 10. So, D(3,10).\n- **E:** The smallest row is 5 and the smallest column is 5. So, E(5,5).\n- **F:** The smallest row is 6 and the smallest column is 2. So, F(6,2).\n- **G:** The smallest row is 7 and the smallest column is 7. So, G(7,7).\n- **H:** The smallest row is 8 and the smallest column is 9. So, H(8,9).\n- **I:** The smallest row is 9 and the smallest column is 4. So, I(9,4).\n- **J:** The smallest row is 4 and the smallest column is 6. So, J(4,6).\n\nNow, we'll output the coordinates in alphabetical order as specified:\n\n```\n[[A(1,1)\nB(3,1)\nC(2,6)\nD(3,10)\nE(5,5)\nF(6,2)\nG(7,7)\nH(8,9)\nI(9,4)\nJ(4,6)]]\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[A(1,1)\nB(3,1)\nC(2,6)\nD(3,10)\nE(5,5)\nF(6,2)\nG(7,7)\nH(8,9)\nI(9,4)\nJ(4,6)]]\n```"}

The numbers at the end of each line and the row of numbers below seem to indicate the counts of substitutions:\n\n1. 'X' changes to 'T': This is indicated by the number following 'T' in the pattern (e.g., if 'T' is followed by '3', three 'X' following 'T' change to 'C').\n2. 'X' changes to 'C': This is indicated in the bottom row of numbers. Each number represents the counts of 'X' to 'C' changes in the column directly above it.\n\nApplying these rules to the given question, we can transform the 'X's to 'T's or 'C's accordingly.\n\nGiven:\n```\nT X X X X X T X T X 3\nX X X X X X X X X X 2\nX X X T X X T X X T 1\nX X T X T X X X X X 3\nX X X T X X X T X X 1\n0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 1 1\n```\n\nApplying the rules:\n\n1. For the first row: 'T X X X X X T X T X 3' means three 'X's after 'T' change to 'C'.\n   - First 'T' at position 1: no change.\n   - Second 'T' at position 7: change three Xs after it.\n   Result: `T X X X X X T C C C`\n\n2. For the second row: 'X X X X X X X X X X 2' means the last two 'X's become 'C'.\n   Result: `X X X X X X X X C C`\n\n3. For the third row: 'X X X T X X T X X T 1' means the 'X' after the second 'T' changes to 'C'.\n   Result: `X X X T X X T X C T`\n\n4. For the fourth row: 'X X T X T X X X X X 3' means three Xs after the 'T' change to 'C'.\n   Result: `X X T X T C C C X X`\n\n5. For the fifth row: 'X X X T X X X T X X 1' means the 'X' after the second 'T' changes to 'C'.\n   Result: `X X X T X X X T C X`\n\n6. Apply the changes based on the bottom row:\n   - Column 1 has 0 changes.\n   - Column 2 has 2 changes:\n     - Second row, second column (second 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n     - Fourth row, second column (second 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n   - Column 3 has 0 changes.\n   - Column 4 has 2 changes:\n     - Third row, fourth column (first 'X' after 'T' in row) becomes 'C'.\n     - Fifth row, fourth column (fourth 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n   - Column 5 has 0 changes.\n   - Column 6 has 2 changes:\n     - Third row, sixth column (second 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n     - Fifth row, sixth column (second 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n   - Column 7 has 0 changes.\n   - Column 8 has 2 changes:\n     - Fourth row, eighth column (second 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n     - Fifth row, eighth column (only 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n   - Column 9 has 1 change:\n     - Third row, ninth column (only 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n   - Column 10 has 1 change:\n     - Second row, tenth column (first 'X' in row) becomes 'C'.\n\nResult after these changes:\n```\nT\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\tT\tC\tC\tC\nX\tC\tX\tX\tX\tC\tX\tX\tC\tC\nX\tX\tX\tT\tX\tC\tT\tX\tC\tT\nX\tC\tX\tT\tX\tT\tC\tC\tC\tX\nX\tX\tX\tT\tC\tX\tX\tX\tT\tC\n```\n\nFinal result wrapped in double square brackets:\n```\n[[T X X X X X T C C C, X C X X X C X X C C, X X X T X C T X C T, X C X T X T C C C X, X X X T C X X X T C]]\n```"}

The \"1\" in row 3, column 1 suggests a mine either above or below. Since row 2, column 1 doesn't have indications or is blank, we place mine in row 4, column 1.\n2. The \"3\" in row 3, column 3 suggests multiple adjacent mines.\n3. The \"2\" in row 1, column 2, and row 1, column 4 suggests mines adjacent that link appropriately with the number \"3\" and adjoining rows and columns.\n\nAfter carefully checking and validating, here is the solution:\n\n### Answer:\n```\n[[X 2 A 2 1 X A,X A A X A X 2,1 A 3 A X A X A,A 1 A X 2 A 2,1 A A 2 3 2 A,1 2 2 A A A X,X A A A 1 A]]\n```\n\nSo, wrapping it in double square brackets as required:\n\n```\n[[X 2 A 2 1 X A,X A A X A X 2,1 A 3 A X A X A,A 1 A X 2 A 2,1 A A 2 3 2 A,1 2 2 A A A X,X A A A 1 A]]\n```\n\nThis represents the minesweeper grid after applying the identified rules."}

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:\n\n1. **Numbers in the matrix**: These numbers represent the count of mines ('A') that are adjacent to that cell. Adjacent cells include the 8 cells surrounding a given cell (diagonally, horizontally, and vertically).\n2. **Mines ('A') in the matrix**: Mines are placed in the positions that were previously represented by certain numbers in the original matrix.\n\nGiven the fourth question and the previous examples, we can determine where mines should be placed and update the adjacent numbers accordingly.\n\nHere's the given question:\n```\nX\t2\tX\tX\tX\nX\tX\tX\t3\t2\n3\tX\t3\tX\tX\n2\tX\tX\t4\tX\nX\t1\tX\t2\tX\n```\n\nWe need to:\n1. Identify the mines based on the values from the original matrix.\n2. Update the numbers around those mines to reflect the number of adjacent mines.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Identify mines:\n   - A mine can be placed where the original matrix has a number which we observed in previous matrices. From previous matrices, we have seen that numbers '1' and '2' were converted into mines 'A'.\n\n2. Eliminate positions based on possible mines:\n   - For simplicity, place mines in positions where the original matrix had '1' or '2'.\n   - Update the surrounding cells to reflect the count of adjacent mines.\n\nLet's place the mines:\n\n- For the first row: Possible positions for mines are wherever there is X and nearby original numbers indicating adjacent mines.\n- For the second row: The second 'X' and the fourth 'X' can be possible mines.\n- For the third row: We look again at adjacent and directly involved numbers.\n- For the fourth and fifth rows: Similar placement.\n\nHere is the updated matrix:\n```\nX\tA\tX\tX\tX\nX\tX\tX\t3\t2\n3\tX\t3\tX\tX\nA\tX\tX\tA\tX\nX\t1\tX\t2\tX\n```\nAfter placing the mines ('A'), we update the numbers around them:\n\nVerify the placement with numbers:\n1. Place mines then verify updated adjacent numbers, ensuring all possible counts are checked.\n\nFinally, the matrix after the updates should look like:\n```\nX\tA\tX\tX\tX\nX\tA\tX\tA\t2\n3\tX\tA\tX\tX\nA\tX\tX\tA\tX\nX\t1\tX\t2\tX\n```\n\nSo the final answer is:\n```\n[[X A X X X,X A X A 2,3 X A X X,A X X A X,X 1 X 2 X]]\n```"}

Move up from the circle position.\n2. Move left.\n3. Move up-left.\n4. Move up-left.\n5. Move up-left.\n6. Move left (notice the inflection point).\n    - (6,8) is the starting and therefore marked as 1.\n7. Follow the arrows till the next inflection point, which happens when reversing left to right.\n8. Continue tracing backward till each change in direction marks a new inflection point.\n\nCarefully apply the inflection point identifiers from the starting point \"○\" and note down the points in the sequence they appear:\n1. Starting point (6,8)\n2. ↑← marks turning left (6,7)\n3. →↘ marks moving up (6,6)\n4. ↑→ marks another change (6,5)\n...\nEach change of direction along this back tracing path must be annotated as we move which gives us following steps accordingly till exhausting the map.\n\n### Convert Path to Grid with Inflection Points:\nMapping these inflection points to a grid:\n```\n[[6th 0   5th 0   0   0   4th 0   3rd 0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0],\n [0   0   0   8th 0   7th 0   0   0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   2nd 0   1st 0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0],\n [0   0   0   0   0   0   0   X   0]]\n * X = Starting position \"○\"\n\nBy proper tracking and back propagation as described each point marked in correct way ordered following.\nThis may apply to ensure generating inflection traces in map.\n\nThus, the sequenced grid would have the answers ordered as:\n[[1 0 2,4 0 5,3 0 6,9 0 8,12 0 11]]\n\n### Conclusion:\nYou might want to reassess the multiple reverses but idea provided typical numeric should be employed.\nThus concluding we prop notify:\n[[(\"1\"),(\"0\"),(\"2\"),(\"0\"),(\"0\"),(\"0\"),(\"4\"),(\"0\"),(\"3\")]\n [\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"8\", \"0\", \"7\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n [\"... outlined per reordered inspecting geometric leading.]\n...

The second row corresponds to the first letter of the word \"ARE\" going down and the second letter of the word \"EAR\" going across. The first cell is part of both, so it should be 'A' (from \"EAR\"). The second cell is 'R' (from \"ARE\"), and the last cell is not part of any word, so it should be 0:\nA R 0\n\n3. The third row corresponds to the second letter of the word \"ARE\" going down and the third letter of the word \"EAR\" going across.

Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To solve the last question, we need to understand the pattern applied in the previous examples. The key is to notice the transformation happening in each grid from the given numbers on the outside to the numbers inside the grid.\n\nFrom previous examples:\n1. The top row and leftmost column numbers dictate the starting points for each row.\n2. The bottom row and rightmost column numbers provide an ordering key for the numbers in each square of the grid.\n\nLet's apply the observed pattern to the new grid:\n\nGrid Layout:\n\t1\t2\t3\t2\n1\tX\tX\tX\tX\t4\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t1\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t3\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n\t3\t2\t1\t2\n\n### Steps:\n1. For each row (from top to bottom), treat the leftmost number as the starting value.\n2. Use the number on the right as the end value for the sequence.\n3.

The goal seems to be arranging the numbers 1 through 4 in each row and column so that they match the given grid layout constraints. Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. The numbers at the edges of the grid (outside the Xs) indicate how many times each number 1 through 4 appears in that row or column.\n2. Use these edge numbers to deduce the unique arrangement of the numbers 1 through 4.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid layout and deduce the values for the Xs:\n\n- The first row of the grid is: `3 X X X X 1`\n- The first column of the grid is: `2 X X X X 2`\n- The second row of the grid is: `1 X X X X 3`\n- The third row of the grid is: `2 X X X X 2`\n- The fourth row of the grid is: `2 X X X X 2`\n- The last row of the grid is: `2 2 1 3`\n\nUsing the edge numbers:\n\n- For the first row (`3 X X X X 1`), it means the row should contain three of one number and one of another number. Since the first value is `3`, the number `3` should appear three times, and the number `1` should appear once.\n- For the first column (`2 X X X X 2`), it means the column should contain two of each pair of numbers. Since the first value is `2`, the numbers `2` and `2` should each appear twice.\n\nFollowing this logic and ensuring that each row and column adheres to these rules, we get:\n\n```\n2 3 2 1\n3 4 1 2\n1 2 4 3\n2 1 3 4\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[2 4 3 1,4 3 1 2,3 2 4 1,1 4 2 3]]"}

We'll use process of elimination and the properties of a Latin square:\n\n1. Since each row and column must contain each number once, we start with the given clues.\n2. We systematically fill in the remaining numbers ensuring no repetitions in rows and columns.\n\nLet's fill the grid step by step:\n\nGiven the constraints:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n3 & X & X & X & X & 1 \\\\\n3 & X & X & X & X & 2 \\\\\n1 & X & X & X & X & 4 \\\\\n2 & X & X & X & X & 2 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nStart filling each row with the available numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n**Step 1:** Apply initial constraints\n```\nGiven grid:\n3   X   X   X   X   1\n3   X   X   X   X   2\n1   X   X   X   X   4\n2   X   X   X   X   2\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Fill based on the left and bottom constraints ensuring no repetitions.\n- First row: 3 _ _ _ _ 1\n- Second row: 4 _ _ _ _ 3 (as it must include 4)\n- Third row: 1 _ _ _ _ 4\n- Fourth row: starts with 2\n\nSo, each column and row must be:\n```\n3   1   4   2   (from the constraints of row/column)\n4   3   1   2\n1   2   3   4\n2   4   3   1\n```\n\nThus, the complete Latin square would be:\n[[3 1 4 2,4 3 1 2,1 2 3 4,2 4 3 1]]"}

Each row appears to shift numbers in a particular sequence to create a unique pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, here's a breakdown of the rules:\n1. The numbers in the first column follow the sequence of the first set of top numbers.\n2. The numbers in the bottom row follow the sequence of the bottom set of numbers.\n3. The numbers in the last column follow the sequence of the last set of right numbers.\n4. The numbers in the middle cells of the grid are calculated by continuing the sequence from the previous filled numbers.\n\nLet's now apply this rule to the given question:\n\nGrid Layout:\n```\n1\t2\t2\t2\n1\tX\tX\tX\tX\t3\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n3\tX\tX\tX\tX\t1\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n4\t1\t3\t2\n```\n\nFilling in the grid:\n- The first row must end in `3` and begin with `1` which gives `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.\n- The second row must end in `2` and begin with `2` which gives `[2, 4, 3, 1]`.\n- The third row must end in `1` and begin with `3` which gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.\n- The fourth row must end in `2` and begin with `2` which continues to `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[1 3 2 4,2 4 3 1,3 1 4 2,2 3 1 4]]\n```\n\nWrapping the entire answer in double square brackets:\n\n```\n[[1 3 2 4,2 4 3 1,3 1 4 2,2 3 1 4]]\n```"}

Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To solve this question, we need to follow a systematic approach based on the observed pattern from the previous examples. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the grid layout:**\n   The given grid is:\n   ```\n   2\t1\t2\t3\n   2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t3\n   3\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n   1\tX\tX\tX\tX\t3\n   2\tX\tX\tX\tX\t1\n   2\t3\t2\t1\n   ```\n\n2. **Understand the rules:**\n   - The goal is to fill the grid such that each row and each column contains four unique numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n   - The marginal values provide clues about the numbers in the corresponding rows and columns.\n   - The marginal values on the left, right, top, and bottom correspond to the first, second, third, and fourth positions in that row/column respectively.\n\n3. **Fill the grid using the marginal values:**\n   - Start with the first row, use the top marginal values to determine the sequence.\n   - Proceed row by row, ensuring that each row and column follows the marginal values' constraints and contains unique numbers.\n\n4. **Execute the filling strategy:**\n   - **Row 1:** Top marginal value for the first row is `2 1 2 3`. Start from the left:\n     - Position 1: 2\n     - Position 2: 1\n     - Position 3: 2 (already exists, choose next unique): 3\n     - Position 4: the remaining number is 4.\n   - **Row 2:** Top marginal value for the second row is `2`. Right marginal values help in the order.\n     - Considering the second column and the constraints, fill uniquely.\n     - Finalize values accordingly.\n   - Repeat for remaining rows to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBased on this systematic approach, the grid is filled as follows:\n\n```\n    2\t1\t2\t3\n    --|-----|-----|----|\n2   2|1|3|4|3|\n3   3|4|2|1|2|\n1   1|2|4|3|3|\n2   2|3|1|4|1|\n    2\t3\t2\t1\n```\n\nConverting this to the requested format:\n\n```\n[[2 1 3 4, 3 4 2 1, 1 2 4 3, 2 3 1 4]]\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[2 1 3 4, 3 4 2 1, 1 2 4 3, 2 3 1 4]]\n```"}

Let's analyze the provided answers and deduce the rules.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. Each question provides a grid with fixed numbers on the borders and 'X's inside.\n2. The answers given always contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in each row and each column.\n3. The arrangement of these numbers seems to follow a specific pattern which we need to deduce.\n\nLet's analyze each given answer to find any patterns or rules:\n\n#### First Example:\nQuestion Grid:\n```\n2        2        1        3\n2        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        2        2        3        1\n```\nAnswer:\n```\n[[3 1 4 2,2 4 3 1,4 2 1 3,1 3 2 4]]\n```\n\n#### Second Example:\nQuestion Grid:\n```\n3        2        2        1\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n3        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        3\n        1        2        2        3\n```\nAnswer:\n```\n[[2 3 1 4,1 2 4 3,3 4 2 1,4 1 3 2]]\n```\n\n#### Third Example:\nQuestion Grid:\n```\n1        2        3        3\n1        X        X        X        X        3\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n3        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        3        3        2        1\n```\nAnswer:\n```\n[[4 3 1 2,3 4 2 1,1 2 4 3,2 1 3 4]]\n```\n\n### Deduced Rule:\n- The number placement follows a pattern that ensures each row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once.\n- This suggests a Latin Square-like arrangement with constraints imposed by the boundary numbers.\n\n### Applying to the Fourth Example:\nQuestion Grid:\n```\n\t2\t3\t5\t2\t1\n3\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t1\n1\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t4\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n4\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n2\tX\tX\tX\tX\tX\t2\n\t2\t3\t1\t2\t3\n```\n\nTo find the correct arrangement:\n1. We need 1, 2, 3, 4 in each row/column.\n2. The numbers must match the constraints given by the outer numbers (i.e., sums, products, etc.).\n\n### Solving Step-by-Step:\nRow 1: `3  X  X  X  X  1` → A possible arrangement considering unique digits could be `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.\nRow 2: `1  X  X  X  X  4` → A possible arrangement considering unique digits could be `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\nRow 3: `2  X  X  X  X  2` → A possible arrangement considering unique digits could be `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.\nRow 4: `4  X  X  X  X  2` → A possible arrangement considering unique digits could be `[2, 1, 3, 4]`.\nRow 5: `2  X  X  X  X  2` → A possible arrangement considering unique digits could be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.\n\nCombining all rows:\n```\n[[1 4 3 2, 2 3 1 4, 3 1 4 2, 2 1 3 4, 1 3 2 4]]\n```\n\nHence, the answer is:\n```\n[[1 4 3 2, 2 3 1 4, 3 1 4 2, 2 1 3 4, 1 3 2 4]]\n```"}
