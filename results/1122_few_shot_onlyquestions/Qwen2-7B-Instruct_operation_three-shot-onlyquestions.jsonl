The computations essentially revolve around finding inverse logarithms or powers that relate two specified numbers. Let's break down the pattern to understand the method applied in each case and identify the rule:\n\n1. **For Question \"Compute 8￠2\"**\n   - **Answer Given**: [[10/3]]\n   - **Interpreted Rule**: The question is expressing a span where the difference or a proportional relationship is sought between two numbers (8 and 2). In this case, it implies that the equivalent of a span operator between 8 and 2 is represented by a fraction equivalent to their logarithmic ratio, resulting in \\( \\log_2{8} = 3 \\), which reverses to \\(8￠2 = \\frac{10}{3}\\) interpreting complexities in span from a logarithmic perspective rather than direct interpretation. This illustrates a method where span is conceptualized in terms of logarithm-based fractions.\n\n2. **For Question \"Compute 4￠9\"**\n   - **Answer Given**: [[\\log_{9}{4}+\\log_{4}{9}]]\n   - **Interpreted Rule**: Underlying this is the log rule that \\( \\log_a{b} + \\log_b{a} = 1 \\). This question specifically inverts traditional logarithmic operation between variables where each variable represents the base of the opposite logarithm and@SpringBootApplication results a conceptual span represented as a mathematical identity akin to 1, rather than the direct span between the numbers.\n\n3. **For Question \"If X￠4=5/2, find X\"**\n   - **Answer Given**: [[16]]\n   - **Interpreted Rule**: This scenario seems to be interpreting the concept backward. From X￠4 = 5/2, the intended interpretation involves finding an X such that the span between X and 4 equates to the fraction 5/2. In the given interpretation, this could suggest a reverse operation or understand ￠ as analogous to logarithmic notation. Given the question's context and answer, it might reflect a scenario where X is found by inverting the normal span or logarithmic relationship, possibly indicating an exponential relationship as seen in \\(4^2 = 16\\), reflecting a direct power operation in relation to the provided fraction. This indicates a need for clarification in the initial setup of the notation but suggests a reversal of typical operations, likely involving powers or roots, especially considering the direct output of 16 as the result.\n\n4. **For the Final Question: \"Compute 16￠256\"**\n   - **Answer Given**: [[\\log_{256}{16}]]\n   - **Interpreted Rule**: Observing the pattern, ￠ introduces a conceptual method akin to logarithms or inverse operations. For this last question, the request to compute 16￠256 aligns with finding the inverse of the span or power relationship being implicitly defined via ￠. The given answer follows suit, representing the logarithmic form closely associated with finding exponents or logarithmic values in the context of spans or jumps from one number to another.\n\nThe overarching rule seems to be interpreting the ￠ operator as a nuanced way to express span, power, or a specific relationship between numbers, often through logarithmic or exponential principles, particularly derived or inverting standard span or difference typical operations in mathematics. The answers provided indicate a method that involves logarithmic identities, inverses, or specific operations that relate directly to the numbers involved, particularly powers and their counterparts in logarithmic representation."}

The answer in the given format suggests a general formula for these cases, though directly applying it without understanding the context might not be straightforward without a clear pattern or rule outlined. Let's break down the operations to see a more logical pattern:\n\n1. **2%3**: It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or alternative interpretation, as the result is simply 2 when computed as a modulo operation, but given the answer provided ([[8+\\sqrt{6}]]), it suggests a specific pattern might exist that involves at least some form of manipulation or representation that isn't the standard modulo operation of `a % b = r` where `0 ≤ r < b`.\n\n2. **4%2**: Indeed, unlike the given example, the standard modulo operation gives 0, but the answer provided ([[16+\\2sqrt{2}]]) suggests again that there might be an ad hoc interpretation or representation involved here which isn't a standard modulo operation.\n\n3. **5%1**: Again, the standard result would be 0, but following the pattern, the answer here ([[5+\\sqrt{5}]]), might follow a certain rule set for these specific cases.\n\n4. **3%2**: Assuming the pattern identified in the previous questions: where the result seems to be represented in a specific format, the answer here would logically follow a similar representation: [[2+\\sqrt{1}]], adhering to the given structure.\n\nWithout a clear and definite rule provided, this answer is speculative and could potentially represent an error or misinterpretation if the context is not clarified. Typically, for `a%b` computations and representation potentially including square roots and such, the task would likely be an exact mathematical problem or detail wishfully projected onto a less conventional or misinterpreted computation, or there's an oversight in the formation or explanation of the rule that's being applied here."}

However, based on the pattern shown in the previous answers, it looks like the operation might actually represent a composition of functions \\(f(g(x))\\). Let's clarify and compute the given function compositions:\n\n### Explanation:\n1. For \\(f(x) = \\ln(x)\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3\\), we computed \\(f(g(x)) = \\ln(x^3)\\), which simplifies due to logarithmic identity \\(\\ln(a^b) = b \\cdot \\ln(a)\\) to \\(\\frac{3\\ln(x)}{x}\\).\n   \n2. For \\(f(x) = x^2\\) and \\(g(x) = \\ln(x)\\), we have \\(f(g(x)) = (\\ln(x))^2\\).\n\n3. For \\(f(x) = e^x\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\), the operation (if intended as composition \\(f(g(x))\\)) results to \\(e^{\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\n4. For \\(f(x) = e^x\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sin(x)\\), the result of computation, as per straightforward composition, is \\(e^{\\sin(x)}\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nConsidering these patterns and focusing on direct computation or logical interpretation based on typical operation between functions (composition in this context), the base operation provided in the questions seems to indicate a composition \\(f(g(x))\\), rather than a Hadamard product. Thus, applying this interpretation:\n\nFor \\(f(x) = e^x\\), and \\(g(x) = \\sin(x)\\), the composition \\(f(g(x)) = e^{\\sin(x)}\\).\n\n[[e^{\\sin(x)}]]"}

For instance, \\(f▽g\\) implies a derivative operation on the product of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). For the specific example of this question, \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and \\(g(x)=sin(x)\\), it translates to finding the derivative of the product \\(x^2 \\cdot sin(x)\\), which utilizes the Product Rule of differentiation. The result of applying this pattern to \\(x^2 \\cdot sin(x)\\) yields \\(x^2 + 2x \\cdot sin(x)\\).
