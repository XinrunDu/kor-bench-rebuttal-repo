Inserted into the format: [[F:x|✓|✓]]\n\n2. **Formula 2: (~p2 || p3) & (p1=::>p2)**\n\n    - This formula will be false if either part is false.\n    - **Part 1:** (~p2 || p3) can be false if p2 is true and p3 is false.\n    - **Part 2:** (p1=::>p2) can be false if p1 is true and p2 is false.\n    - Therefore, for the formula to be false, the falsity value could be either:\n        - p1 being false doesn't matter here, but p2 must be true (for ~p2) and p3 false (for ~p3).\n        - Or, p1 must be true and p2 false.\n    \n    In format:\n    - From Part 1: [[F:✓|✓|x]]\n    - From Part 2: [[F:✓|x|✓]]\n   \n    Considering only unique falsity values, the answer will combine them: [[F:x|✓|x], [F:✓|x|✓]]\n\n3. **Formula 3: (p1=::>p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)**\n\n    - This formula will be false if either part is false.\n    - **Part 1:** (p1=::>p2) can be false if p1 is true and p2 is false.\n    - **Part 2:** (~(p1 & p3) || p1) can be false if p1 & p3 must be true and p1 must be false, which is a contradictory case and cannot happen.\n    \n    Hence the falsity value from Part 1: p1 true, p2 false.\n\n    In format: [[F:✓|x|x]]\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:x|✓|x,✓|x|✓];[F:✓|x|x]]"}

By resolution law (using `!p` twice), this simplifies further to `!p`.\n- Hence, the expression `!( (p | q) & !p ) | q` simplifies to `!p | q`.\n- Now, substitute this result back into the original expression: `p & (!p | q)`.\n- This can be rewritten using distributive law as `(p & !p) | (p & q)`.\n- Since `(p & !p)` is a contradiction (`F`), the expression simplifies to `F | (p & q)`, which is ultimately `p & q`.\n  \n### Final Answers:\nBased on the derivations, the simplified expressions are:\n- For (1): `F` (False)\n- For (2): `p & q`\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n[[\"F\"; \"p & q\"]]"}

Each question so far has relied on transforming logical expressions using a set of known equivalences, such as De Morgan's laws, implication transformations, or distributive laws. Here, we are presented with questions about the associativity of two logical operators denoted by ⇓ and ⇑.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the operators, we understand that:\n- The operator ⇓ represents the logical AND operation (∧), and\n- The operator ⇑ represents the logical NOR operation (which can be represented by !(p | q) or !p & !q).\n\nGiven these interpretations:\n1. For the first sub-question (p⇓q)⇓r ::= p⇓(q⇓r):\n   - This asks whether AND is associative, meaning (p ∧ q) ∧ r is the same as p ∧ (q ∧ r), which is a known property of logical AND. Thus, the answer is Yes.\n2. For the second sub-question (p⇑q)⇑r ::= p⇑(q⇑r):\n   - This asks about the associativity of NOR. By expanding in terms of AND and NOT, NOR is not generally associative. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nThus, following the format prescribed in the question, the answer will be:\n[[A];[B]]"}

Thus, C1 = p & !q.\n- C2 (Person B's statements are partially correct): This would mean either p is correct and !q is wrong (p&q) or vice versa (!p&!q). Thus, C2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q).\n- C3 (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect): This case reflects that p is wrong and q is correct, i.e., !p&q is true. Thus, C3 = !p & q.\n\nPerson C has the following logical definitions:\n- D1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct): !q&!r should be true, making D1 = !q & !r.\n- D2 (Person C's statements are partially correct): This implies one claim is true and the other is false, leading to two cases: !q&r or q&!r. Thus, D2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r).\n- D3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect): This opposes both of C's claims, making both statements false, thus q&r is true. Hence, D3 = q & r.\n\nThe logical expressions formatted as required are:\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(!p&!q)|(p&q)];[C3=!p&q];[D1=!q&!r];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q&r]]."}

The given expression cannot be evaluated to be true under all possible combination of p, q, and r. For example, if p is false, q is true, and r is false, the expression is false. Therefore, it is not a tautology.\n\nB. **Contradiction**: A contradiction is a statement that is always false, regardless of the truth values of the individual variables. The expression given can be true. For example, if p is true, q is true, and r is true, then the expression is true. Therefore, it is not a contradiction.\n\nC. **Basic formula**: Without a strict definition provided for what makes a formula 'basic', this term could be ambiguous in the context provided. Given the examples, this seems less likely to be the case.\n\nD. **All-even formula**: This typically applies when all terms in a disjunction (or conjunction for disjunctive normal form) have an even number of negations. For the terms here, \\((¬p∧¬q∧r)\\) and \\((p∧q∧r)\\) have 2 and 0 negations respectively, both being even.

Each term in the conjunction includes all variables in disjunctive form, which makes it conform to the PCNF. The denoted expression can be represented using M-notation, where each M represents a disjunctive clause in the principal conjunctive normal form. The terms p∨r, ¬q∨r, and ¬p∨q∨¬r are simplified to their corresponding clause numbers based on the truth table order in the context, leading to the denotation [M1∧M3∧M4]."}

The \"all-even form\" is less standard but can be interpreted here as a form where each conjunctive (or disjunctive) term contains an even number of variables. Given that the formula A contains 4 propositional variables (let's denote them as p, q, r, s), we are looking for a basic form where each term contains an even number of variables.\n\nSince we need each term in a basic form to include all 4 variables, the only way to also satisfy the \"all-even form\" condition is to combine the variables such that they always pair up in negative-positive pairs or all in positive/negative form, maintaining an even number (which in this scenario means 4, the only even number possible given the requirement of including all variables).\n\nFor a basic conjunctive/disjunctive form, the total number of combinations considering the possibility of each variable appearing in its positive or negative form is \\(2^n\\), where n is the number of variables. Since we are given 4 variables, the total number of possible combinations is \\(2^4 = 16\\). However, for a basic form, all variables must be included in each term, making the 16 the number of terms in the pure basic form.\n\nSince the question narrows down to terms being both basic and all-even, and given that \"all-even\" in this context must mean each term must include 4 variables (which is true for all terms in a basic form with 4 variables), all 16 of the originally derived combinations qualify.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[16]]."}

The goal is to determine if the expression can be reduced and to what extent. The expression includes a clause with the literal q alone, which signifies that q must be true for the entire expression to hold true. The clauses (¬p ∨ q) and (p ∨ q) can be resolved since q is always true regardless of p's value.

To resolve this with the resolution algorithm, we can simplify it as follows:\n\n1. p and (p ∨ q) can be directly simplified to p since \"p\" is already true, making the disjunction redundant.\n2. p and (p ∨ ¬q) similarly simplifies to p.\n3.

Since p is already isolated, and both (q ∨ ¬r) and (q ∨ r) will ultimately have q as the common variable, simplifying the entire expression does not change the isolated p.\n   \nTherefore, the output of the resolution algorithm is simply \"p\".

This could be symbolized as F(2) & ¬(∃x(F(x) & x ≠ 2)). The statement \"4 is a composite number\" is simply stating a fact about the number 4 and does not follow the conditional or \"only\" statement format, so it is just denoted as G(4). However, since G(x) represents the composite number status of 4 and we do not have a direct predicate for composite numbers stated, we assume it’s a descriptive part of the sentence that doesn't directly go into the logical symbolization unless specified differently.\n- For the second proposition, if 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6, using the predicate G(x, y): x > y, the symbolization follows directly as G(5,4)⇒G(4,6).\n\nNote: It's important to correctly define what G(4) represents as it wasn't clearly part of the symbolization framework given in the problem statement. The primary focus seems to be on converting direct conditions into logical symbols based on definitions provided."}

However, a smarter simplification would acknowledge the nature of the relations over the natural numbers. Thus, a more accurate representation could be as follows:\n\n1. For ∀xF(g(x,a),x), using gJ(x,y) = x * y and a′ = 2, directly apply these to produce (x*2=x). This generally results in a false expression for any natural number x except x=0 (but 0 is not a natural number in strict terms, so for all natural numbers it is false overall). However, in the question format, we directly reflect the formula's structure under J as [[∀x(x*2=x)].\n\n2. For ∃xF(f(x,a),y)→∃yF(f(y,a),x), apply fJ(x,y) = x + y and a′ = 2 to derive (x+2=y)→(y+2=x). The logical value of this implication depends on the range of x and y; however, staying strictly with the format and without simplifying based on natural number properties beyond the formula structure, represent the formula's transformation under J as [[∃x(x+2=y)→∃y(y+2=x)]].\n\nHence, the answer is [[∀x(x*2=x)]; [∃x(x+2=y)→∃y(y+2=x)]], noting the descriptive follow-through over direct truth evaluation for the implication."}

For example, \"All algorithms are efficient\" becomes \"All algorithms are not non-efficient.\"\n\n- **Method B:** This method appears to rephrase the sentence by swapping the subject and the predicate without changing the meaning. For instance, \"Some apps are free apps\" is rephrased as \"Some free apps are apps.\"\n\n- **Method C:** Infers that if a class (subject) does not completely contain another class (predicate), then there exists an overlap between the negative of the predicate and the subject.

The first example uses a symbolic representation to demonstrate negation, the second involves identifying a contradictory relationship, the third involves identifying a biconditional inference (an if-and-only-if relationship), and requires us to interpret what those relationships symbolically represent.\n\nGiven the question about \"Modal Reasoning Formula 7,\" we must infer what is being asked based on the context of the previous examples. Modal logics typically use operators to express necessity, possibility, etc. The concept of a formula and the options given suggest we are looking for a relationship that forms a part of modal logic.\n\nGiven that the other answers correspond to identifying relations (contradictory, inferential, etc.), and the fact that modal reasoning often deals with the relationships of necessity and possibility, which could be understood similarly to inferential relationships in a modal context, we might assume that the question is asking for a type of inferential or transformational relationship.\n\nSince we've seen relational options like A, B, C, and D in a previous example, and assuming that modal reasoning formula 7 would also indicate a similar type of logical relationship, the most reasonable answer in this context, mirroring previous patterns, would likely be the one expressing a similar inferential relationship, matching the third example where an inference is made and identified with a number.\n\nThus, by analogy with the third question, we can reasonably infer:\n[[B]]"}

In that pair, propositions regarding actions or states that happened at specific or nonspecific points in the past were symbolized using \"H\" to denote that the action or state occurred at some point in the historical context. Since both new propositions refer to past occurrences, the same \"H\" operator should be used.\n\nFor the first proposition \"Wang Qiang worked in Beijing for one year in the past,\" the use of \"H\" indicates at some point in the past. The second proposition \"Lin Min has lived in Ningbo in the past\" also refers to the past, and thus \"P\" is used, indicating that Lin Min has experienced this state in the past. However, because no specific operator corresponding to \"P\" was given in the guidelines, and considering \"H\" is used for past occurrences, a uniform approach might be to apply \"H\" for both, or if strictly applying the format, \"P\" could denote a more general past tense as used.

For the final question, the statement about Alice believing that the sun rises in the east only implies that Alice holds this belief but does not directly address whether she may doubt it, whether it's true in reality, or if she is unaware of it. Thus, the option stating that it is true that the sun rises in the east (B) is not the direct implication of her belief according to the given information, but as the provided options go, it seems to be the least incorrect or most implicitly true based on the premise of the belief described. However, to be precise within the context of belief axioms usually discussed, it might more accurately reflect a factual statement than a deduction about belief or lack thereof. Therefore, it is not a strict deduction from her belief but rather an acknowledgment of a factual statement, which the question implicitly treats as an answer format option."}

Thus, a direct format acknowledging their simultaneous operation is presumed in simpler notation aligned with previous questions regarding rules:\n\n[[[c1||c2]φ]]\n\nSince no explicit notation from the previous questions indicates the precise format for concurrency (given the variability across formalisms), but sticking closely to presumed simplifications: \n\n[[[c1|c2]φ]]\n\nOr in a format that might fit most closely to the pattern of the previous questions:\n\n[[⟨c1|c2⟩φ]]\n\nThe most appropriate format, considering the pattern but under the constraint of needing a 'simplest form', should follow closely the given examples of compact representation:\n\n[[⟨c1|c2⟩φ]]\n\nThis format assumes a compact notation representing that both commands can operate concurrently concerning the proposition φ."}

This is indicative of a **counterfactual method** where the existence of a common variable (Training Program X) alongside different conditions results in similar outcomes, suggesting a causal relationship (match with [A]).\n\n2. **New Drug and Lifestyle Impacting Blood Pressure**: This scenario features comparison between two different situations (taking the new drug vs. not taking it but following the same lifestyle) with similar outcomes (reduce blood pressure), suggesting it’s not solely due to the drug but possibly lifestyle change or interaction. This aligns more with a **confounder method**, indicating possibly a third variable impacting the outcome unfairly crediting the drug (match with [B]).\n\n3. **Investment Impacting Economic Growth**: Here, various forms of investment (education, infrastructure, healthcare) have a positive impact (economic growth), leading to a conclusion about overall investment's role. This broad observation of multiple factors influencing a single outcome without detailed focus on individual causal relationships translates to using a **multivariate method** (match with [D]).\n\n4. **Movement and Heat Generation**: This scenario involves multiple instances (rubbing hands, striking stones, hammering iron) all leading to heat. This pattern suggests a **common cause method**, showing that the same effect (heat generation) arises from a similar action (movement), implying that movement (the common factor) is the cause of heat generation.\n\nGiven the described pattern and matching the method titled \"common cause method,\" the correct answer for the last question is:\n\n[[C]]"}

This process of identifying a common cause among varying conditions that lead to a consistent outcome aligns with a method of causal inference that looks for a common denominator in diverse settings, suggesting a use of a comparative method or what in logic and cause-effect analysis terminology might be referred to as the \"concomitant variation\" or \"agreement\" method.

This closely mirrors methods for causal inference that involve empirical evidence and control.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer likely fits method D (Experimental Observation), as the Curies' process involves detailed observation and experimentation that goes beyond simple comparative analysis, aligning closely with pattern D's focus on establishing causal relationships through multiple empirical factors or specific experiments.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\nThe given examples define each paradox scenario in a simplified manner but do not explicitly explain what \"GB Paradox\", \"BC Paradox\", and \"LS Paradox\" are. However, based on the provided examples and the nature of the questions, we can infer the type of logical contradiction each represents:\n\n1. The first scenario deals with a form of contradictory growth factors (sunlight vs. water) without resolving the clear contradiction or defining a specific category of paradox, hence the answer was [[A]].\n2. The second scenario involves a contradictory observation about flying capabilities within a region, leading to a scenario that does not align with classically defined logical paradoxes but could be seen as a conflict in confirmatory evidence, hence the answer was [[B]].\n3. The third scenario about plants involves logical consequences that contradict the initial hypothesis about consistent growth, pointing towards a specific type of logical paradox - the logical structure implicates a paradox that emerges due to logical inconsistencies, and in this case, the answer was [[A]] under the assumption that \"LS Paradox\" relates to logical structure or implication paradoxes.\n\nFor the last question, we have a direct logical contradiction involving \"All birds fly\" and \"Penguins are birds\" while acknowledging \"Penguins do not fly.\" This constitutes a standard logical paradox, often referred to as the \"paradox of entailment\" in logic, as it deals with the logical relationship directly contradicting reality. Given there's no clear definition for \"GB\", \"BC\", or \"LS\" here beyond examples, we can infer \"LS Paradox\" may refer to logical structure, which would be the closest match for this conundrum, hence the answer [[C]]."}

The **GB Paradox** is indicated in a scenario involving conditions leading to faster growth in a plant, suggesting a connection to growth conditions leading to contradictory conclusions.\n2. The **BC Paradox** is related to a situation where contradictory observations confirm an overarching hypothesis, showing that different states of a subject (capable and incapable of flight) can paradoxically confirm a hypothesis about that subject's status.\n3. The **LS Paradox** is connected to a scenario that involves contradictory observations about the consistent behavior of different plants when these are assumed to uniformly exhibit certain characteristics under all conditions.\n\nGiven the logical expression: (q_1 → p) ∧ (q_2 → p) ∧ (q_1 ∧ q_2 → ⊥), we note that:\n- Both q_1 and q_2 individually leading to p are conditions that if both were true would imply p (consistent outcomes).\n- However, when q_1 and q_2 are both true, they lead to a contradiction (⊥).\n\nThis setup is similar to having different conditions each independently confirming a hypothesis but when considered together, lead to a contradiction. This is most closely aligned with the BC Paradox as it involves the issue of contradictory conditions confirming an overarching fact.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

In the last question, although the symbol \"↔\" is different from the other examples, the sentence \"I ↔ the meeting is now open\" appears to be a statement declaring a fact, which aligns with the definition of Assertives. The question, however, offers 'Declarations' (D) as an option, which is not part of the initial categories. Given the instruction, and considering common speech act theory, where declarations change the status of a situation by announcing it (like opening a meeting), the closest matching category among the provided choices would be \"A. Assertives,\" assuming the pattern should fit this format. If 'Declarations' were intended as a proper category, the closest actual answer from the options would be [[D]], aligning with the unique nature of the speech act described."}

When the sentence is about the speaker committing to a future action (e.g., \"to attend the meeting tomorrow\"), it is categorized as Commissives (C).\n3. Expressions that convey feelings or attitudes (e.g., \"I'm sorry that I missed your call\") are classified as Expressives (D).\n4. Assertions are statements that make claims about the world or report state-of-affairs, such as \"You have been appointed as the new project manager.\" The use of ↔ among the options suggests mutual information exchange, which often aligns with asserting facts, hence fitting into the Assertives category (A).\n\nGiven the pattern, the last sentence, \"I ↔ You have been appointed as the new project manager,\" is making a statement about a fact (appointment), which aligns with being an assertive expression.

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
