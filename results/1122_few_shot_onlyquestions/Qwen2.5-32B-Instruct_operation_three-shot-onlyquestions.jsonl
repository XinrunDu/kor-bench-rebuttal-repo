When a is a multiple of b: \\(a ※ b = \\frac{a}{b} + C\\)\n2. When b is a multiple of a: \\(a ※ b = \\frac{b}{a} + C\\)\n3. When neither is a multiple of the other: \\(a ※ b = 24\\)\n\nAlso, we were told that when \\(10 ※ 2 = 9\\), it follows that \\(C = 4\\). This is because 10 is a multiple of 2, so \\(10 ※ 2 = \\frac{10}{2} + C = 5 + C = 9\\), which means \\(C = 4\\).\n\nNow, we need to compute \\(25 ※ 5 ※ 14\\). According to operator precedence, we first compute the result of the first two elements which are \\(25 ※ 5\\).\n\nSince 25 is a multiple of 5, we can use the first rule of the operator \"※\": \n\\[25 ※ 5 = \\frac{25}{5} + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9\\]\n\nNext, we use the obtained result and the remaining part of the expression:\n\\[9 ※ 14\\]\n\nSince neither 9 is a multiple of 14 nor 14 is a multiple of 9, we apply the third rule of the operator \"※\":\n\\[9 ※ 14 = 24\\]\n\nThus, \\[25 ※ 5 ※ 14 = 24\\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n[[24]]"}

The first rule seems somewhat ambiguous or unconventional based on the given result [[40]] for 1○3, and there isn't enough information in the single response to directly infer the operation.\n2. The second one introduces a bit more clarity with a conditional. It suggests that X○2=21 can be resolved to X being either 1 or -9.

For the third equation, we're asked to find parameters x and y such that 7○2 = 81 and 2○3 = 25, given the formula \\((xA + yB) \\times (A + B)\\). By substituting A and B with 7 and 2, and then 2 and 3 respectively, solving the system of equations:\n    - For 7○2=81, we have \\((7x + 2y) \\times (7+2) = 81\\), simplifying to \\((7x + 2y) \\times 9 = 81\\) or \\(7x + 2y = 9\\).\n    - For 2○3=25, we have \\((2x + 3y) \\times (2+3) = 25\\), simplifying to \\((2x + 3y) \\times 5 = 25\\) or \\(2x + 3y = 5\\).\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n- \\(7x + 2y = 9\\)\n- \\(2x + 3y = 5\\)\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:\n- \\(21x + 6y = 27\\)\n- \\(4x + 6y = 10\\)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n- \\(17x = 17\\), \n- So, \\(x = 1\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x=1\\) into \\(2x + 3y = 5\\) gives us \\(2 + 3y = 5\\), thus:\n- \\(3y = 3\\) and \\(y = 1\\).\n\nGiven these values (x=1, y=1), the operation A○B is defined as \\((A + B)^2\\).\n\nNow applying to 2○3, we have \\(A = 2\\) and \\(B = 3\\):\n- \\(2○3 = (2 + 3) \\times (2 + 3) = 5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[25]]"}

In the second example, the rule was not explicitly defined, but the operation reasonably determined the values through trial or a pre-defined rule.\n3. In the third example, a clear definition provided, A○B = (xA + yB) × (A + B), with specific parameters that solved for x and y.\n\nFor the fourth example, if we are to follow the same logic and to assume that the previously found parameters (x=1, y=1) are applicable in this case, we can use them to solve the equation.\n\nGiven that X○5 = 200 and using the found parameters (x=1, y=1), we apply the operation:\n\n\\[ (1 \\times X + 1 \\times 5) \\times (X + 5) = 200 \\]\n\nThis equation can be simplified to:\n\n\\[ (X + 5) \\times (X + 5) = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ (X + 5)^2 = 200 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ X + 5 = \\sqrt{200} \\] or \\[ X + 5 = -\\sqrt{200} \\]\n\nComputing the values:\n\n\\[ X + 5 = 14.142 \\] or \\[ X + 5 = -14.142 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 9.142 \\] or \\[ X = -19.142 \\]\n\nSince the instructions suggest to use integers, it seems like the original rule or pattern was perhaps reliant on non-explicit integer base assumptions or another pattern from the first example which resulted in an integer.\n\nThus, interpreting the problem under the assumption that an integer solution was implicitly being looked for:\n\nThe closest integers to these solutions could be interpreted as:\n\\[ X = 9 \\] or \\[ X = -19 \\]\n\nThus, the answer would be:\n\n[[9or-19]]"}

Hence, this method might not apply. Let's try another approach.\n2. ⟨4,3,7,1⟩ = [[30]]: Similarly, if we try (4*1) + (3*3) + (7*1), we get 4 + 9 + 7 = 20, which again does not seem to match the given answer of [[30]]. This indicates that the simple multiplication and addition approach might not be correct.\n3. For ⟨4,X,8,3⟩=21, let's assume some other arithmetic operation or pattern. Given the answer X=2, this would mean that the chosen operation with these inputs results in 21. Let's try using a general method, such as summing the numbers and multiplying by the last number in the sequence: (4 + X + 8) * 3 = 21. Simplifying: (12 + X) * 3 = 21. Thus, 12 + X = 7, leading to X = -5, which contradicts the answer X=2, indicating we might need a different rule.\n   \nThe first two answers [[14]] and [[30]] strongly suggest that the answer could be a sum. For instance, 2+3+4+2 = 11, not 14, but if we consider another potential operation, such as multiplying each number by its position in the sequence, and then summing those: (2*1) + (3*2) + (4*3) + (2*4) = 2 + 6 + 12 + 8 = [[28]], it still does not suit our purpose.\n  \nNevertheless, comparing each set of inputs in the calculation method, noticing the discrepancy between expected and given answers, a logical route would apply a base rule like summing all numbers with an additional constant added for each example that aligns with the results provided, hinting at this summing might involve some specific constant term or the pure sum that matches the answers without needing sophisticated calculation beyond understanding the mechanism. Given the question's simplicity and immediate answer format, the declared rule for computation seems to follow a direct pattern with sum adjustment.\n\nFor the final question, if ⟨3,4,7,w⟩=29, and considering the pattern, solving for w by summing the values: (3 + 4 + 7 + w) = 29, leading to: 14 + w = 29, thus w = 15.

Instead, we need to derive a possible formula or rule based on the given examples.\n\nLet's look at the formula needed. If we take 3∞4 as an example, we suspect some operation involving 3 and 4 to yield 25. Similarly, 2∞5 yields 29. Observing these pairs, one possible relationship could be incorporating the square of the first number and then adding/subtracting some function of the second number.\n\n1. Looking at 3 and 4, and their result 25:\n   - 3^2 = 9; to get 25 we can consider the operation as 9 + 16, where 16 = 4^2.\n2. For 2 and 5 resulting in 29:\n   - 2^2 = 4; to get 29, we find 4 + 25 (and 25 = 5^2).\n\nLet's confirm this pattern for X where X∞4 = 32.

Let's deduce the rule:\n\n1. For 3∞4 = 25 and 2∞5 = 29, a pattern suggests that the operation involves multiplying the first number and then adding the second number or doing the reverse. To clarify, if we assume the operation as \"a∞b = ab + a + b\" (a possible hypothesis), then:\n\n   - 3∞4 = (3 * 4) + 3 + 4 = 12 + 3 + 4 = 19. This does not match [[25]], so we should consider another hypothesis.\n   - Considering the operation as \"a∞b = ab + a + b + some_constant\", we find that the math needs adjustment for a closer fit; our initial assumption needs refining.\n\n2. Rechecking the operation with more direct proportion might clarify:\n   - 3∞4 = 25, let's try squaring the first term and then adding something, e.g., \"a∞b = a^2 + b\".\n   - 3∞4 = 3^2 + 16 = 25, showing \"16\" perhaps accounts for the second term and a constant.\n\n3.

In the first question, (7&4) + (5$8) = [[12]], it suggests that the operation \"&\" and \"$\" are performing specific operations to reach the sum of 12. Observing the answer and the values, it seems that \"&\" could mean subtraction when the left number is larger (7-4=3) and \"$\" could mean addition (5+8=13), but it can't be entirely certain without more context. However, the structure suggests a simple arithmetic operation.\n\n2. In the second question, (12$7)×(4&9) = [[48]], a similar pattern is suggested. Here \"$\" might imply addition (12+7=19) and \"&\" might imply subtraction (9-4=5). Multiplying these gives 19×5 = 95, which is not the actual answer, indicating that \"&\" operation might work differently. Given the rule and the actual answer of 48, it suggests that the \"&\" operation might simply be the smaller number, giving us 4, and \"$\" remains addition.\n\n3. The third question introduces a new dynamic with the inequality. It shows that \"x&9=10\" means when X is larger or equal to 10, it meets the condition. This indicates the \"&\" operation involves a comparison. \n\nFor the last question, (2§8)-(5$1) is the task. Given that we don't have answers relating to the § operation, and we've been hinting at more comparative or direct arithmetic operations for \"&\" and \"$\", we might infer that \"§\" could again imply a direct arithmetic operation, possibly subtraction or comparison. In absence of specific information and previous answers treating similarly, let's assume \"§\" implies subtraction similar to previous observations (8-2=6), and \"$\" implying addition (5+1=6). Thus, (2§8) - (5$1) can be seen as 6 - 6 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, formatted as instructed, is [[0]]."}

Adding them together yields 43, but the answer states it's 12. This example doesn't precisely follow our assumption that \"&\" is subtraction and \"$\" is multiplication. But it seems the \"+\" combining them is typically an addition.\n- For (12$7) × (4&9): If \"$\" is multiplication, 12 * 7 = 84, and if \"&\" represents subtraction, 4 - 9 = -5. Multiplying 84 and -5 results in -420, not the given 48. This suggests \"$\" might denote something else in the first equation or an error in assumption of combined operations' treatment. Yet, if we consider \"$\" as division for some equations and subtraction for \"&\", we still miss a complete pattern like the above.\n\nHowever, the most consistent operation based on the expected patterns is typically to assume the most straightforward traditional arithmetic for operations in unknown scenarios and then apply the pattern to solve:\n\nFor (9$6)+(4§4), if we assume $ represents multiplication and § represents addition following common algebraic operations:\n- (9$6) would be (9*6) = 54.\n- (4§4) would be (4+4) = 8.\n- Then, combine them: 54 + 8 = 62.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be [[62]], applying the pattern of arithmetic operations and treating the missing operation symbol as addition, under the logic of typical arithmetic assumptions without additional constraints specified in the first part of the examples."}

If we follow the idea that \"$\" might represent subtraction of the smaller number from the larger (12-7=5) and \"&\" as multiplication (4×9=36), then the product of these is 5×36=180, but the answer is [[48]], which again suggests a different approach.\n3.

Here, it suggests that \"x&9\" adds 9 to x to make it at least 10, thus X ≥ 10.\n\nGiven these observations, we make an educated guess that:\n- The \"&\" operation could represent subtraction where the number must be greater or equal to reach the result.\n- The \"$\" operation could denote subtraction by the smallest value, i.e., taking the larger number and subtracting the smaller.\n- The \"§\" operation's nature is not explicitly clear from the examples given, but it can be deduced based on operations performed.\n\nFor the question \"Compute (3§7)/(8$2).\", let's infer:\n- \"8$2\" could be interpreted as taking 8 and subtracting 2, resulting in 6.\n- For \"(3§7)\", if we consider a similar subtractive or comparative logic to match the previously inferred rule, we might interpret \"§\" as a subtraction operation akin to \"$\", resulting in \"7-3=4\".\n\nThus, the problem can be simplified to (4)/(6) as a fraction, which is 4/6, simplified to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [[2/3]]."}

In the first question, we have (7&4) + (5$8) = [[12]]. This suggests that the operation \"&\" might involve subtraction (since 7 - 4 = 3) and the operation \"$\" might involve addition (since 5 + 8 = 13). Adding these gives 3 + 13 = 16, but the answer is 12, suggesting an additional operation might be needed post calculation, but in standard math, the results should match, so there might be an action to adjust or round towards the nearest given answer.\n   \n2. For the second question, (12$7) × (4&9) = [[48]]. Here, it looks like (12$7) performed the addition rule (12 + 7 = 19), and (4&9) performed the subtraction rule (4 - 9 = -5), resulting in 19 * -5 = -95. Given the rule should strictly yield a positive number, and since the result is 48, we may consider an adjustment or error in considering the rules.\n   \n3. In the third question, \"If x&9=10, find X\", we know the \"&\" operation involves subtraction postulating X - 9 ≥ 10, leading to X ≥ 19. Given the rule, we adjust to X ≥ 10 in the context of the problem setup.\n\nFor the last question \"(X § 4) + (3 $ 2) = 10\":\n- We know from \"3 $ 2\" that this operation likely adds 3 + 2 = 5.\n- Therefore, (X § 4) + 5 = 10.\n- Simplifying this gives (X § 4) = 5, assuming \"§\" is another form of an operation, likely a variation of addition or subtraction but considering the context, we evaluate it as forming a target sum.\n\nGiven that the equation needs to hold true to reach 10, and knowing 5 is already there, X § 4 should aim at 5 to fulfill the equation. That means given \"X § 4\" can be seen as an increase operation, to resolve to 5, X must start from 1 to ensure a result of 5. Hence, X in an increase context as provided by operation \"§\" should logically be \"≥1\".\n\nConcluding, the answer for the final question would be:\n[[X≥1]].\n(I provided a solution based on the present rules we inferred but also highlighted an observed rule inconsistency across operations \"&\" and \"$\".

No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the pattern, we must first decipher the symbols used in the arithmetic operations. Let's look at the previous examples:\n\n1. The equation `(7&4) + (5$8) = [[12]]` suggests that the `&` and `$` symbols represent some operations. If we incorrectly guess, we could assume that `&` represents subtraction and `$` represents addition. So, `(7&4) = 7 - 4 = 3` and `(5$8) = 5 + 8 = 13`. Adding these, we get `3 + 13 = 16`, which doesn't match `[[12]]`. This means our initial guess isn't correct.\n\n2. Next equation: `(12$7) × (4&9) = [[48]]`. If we assume `$` is addition and `&` is division, `(12$7) = 12 + 7 = 19` and `(4&9) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444`, and thus `19 × 0.444 = 8.436`, which also does not match `[[48]]`.\n\nThe pattern seems elusive initially but appears clearer if we consider some different operations. From the answers given, we can hypothesize that:\n\n- `&` might represent the subtraction operation.\n- `$` might represent multiplication.\n\nSo, let's re-check with the correct interpretation assuming `&` as subtraction and `$` as multiplication:\n- From the first example, `(7&4) = 7 - 4 = 3` and `(5$8) = 5 * 8 = 40`. Summing `3 + 40` does not result in `[[12]]`.\n\nFurther, if `§` is addition:\n- For the question `(6 $ X) + (9 § 2) = 15`, and using the hypothesis that `$` means multiplication and `§` means addition:\n  - Let's replace and solve: `(6 * X) + (9 + 2) = 15`\n  - This simplifies to: `6X + 11 = 15`\n  - Subtract 11 from both sides: `6X = 4`\n  - Divide both sides by 6: `X = 4 / 6 = 2/3`\n\nSince the problem asks for an inequality and considering the possible rounding or simplification errors, we can conclude that the only way `X = 2/3` fits an inequality would be `X ≤ 1` (considering the simplification and rounding to common values).\n\nThus, the answer is [[X≤1]]."}

For example, (12$7)×(4&9) = 48 can be interpreted as (12*7) * (4-9), which simplifies to 84 * (-5) and is incorrect based on the provided answer, so \"$\" could simply indicate multiplication directly to fit the result pattern.\n\nFor the symbol \"§\", given it hasn't been used before, we consider it might represent addition due to lack of other info and to fit into common arithmetic operations.\n\nGiven (X § 10) / (4 $ 2) = 5,\nReplacing symbols based on observed patterns, the equation becomes (X + 10) / (4 * 2) = 5,\nThis simplifies to (X + 10) / 8 = 5.\nSolving for X:\nX + 10 = 40,\nX = 30.\n\nGiven the instructions for answer formatting and since the requirement asks for an inequality format even though a specific equality was deduced, this may require presentation as an exact match for X, which traditionally isn't an inequality.

If we assume 1◇1 results in 2 based on addition, and then multiply by 3, the operation again is plausible but still dependent on the pattern we find in the next element.\n\nFrom the third question, with the known answer [[4]]:\n- We have (16★X)◇3=23/2. If ★ represents multiplication and ◇ represents addition with fractions (like adding a half), then (16★4) would be 64, then 64◇3 = 64 + (3/2), which indeed is 128/2 + 3/2 = 131/2, not 23/2. This signals we missed a pattern. Revisiting, if 16★X describes a division operation influenced by the next equation, another possible understanding is needed.\n\nAnalyzing patterns, these operators seem complex, particularly if they don’t follow simple arithmetic. A new insight considers:\n- For the third question, [[23/2]], can rewrite (16★4) as 16/4 = 4, then 4◇3 indicates 4 + (3/2) which logically fits, confirming the operators:\n\nThe symbols suggest:\n- ★ could represent a form of division or multiplication.\n- ◇ could represent an addition, potentially involving fractions.\n- ① and ② are less recognized, possibly operations to combine numbers in a defined way.\n\nFor the last question, (X①3)②2=10:\n- In simpler patterns with the insight, ① and ② might imply a base form of multiplication and addition respectively. Assumed operations to reach the outcome defined, for simplicity's sake if ① represents addition again, X + 3, to combine by a multiplier(②), (X + 3) * 2 = 10. Solving linearly implies X + 3 = 5, and then X = 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer to (X①3)②2=10, is:\n[[2]]"}

Hence, the answer can be considered:\n[[2 + 1/2]]\n\nThus, the final form to preserve consistent format:\n[[\\log_{256}{16}+\\log_{16}{256}]]\n\nHowever, based on the exact power relationship (16^2=256), if a direct simplified fraction is required, we wrap:\n[[2 + 1/2]]\n\nBut considering form consistency and pattern, let's prefer the logarithmic form:\n[[\\log_{256}{16}+\\log_{16}{256}]]"}

This led me to guess some kind of non-linear operation is likely involved.\n\n2. **Hypothesize and test:**\n\n   - If A ¥ B = A² - B², let's verify with given equations:\n     - 4 ¥ 2 = 4² - 2² = 16 - 4 = 12 (which is incorrect compared to the provided answer).\n     - 3 ¥ 4 = 3² - 4² = 9 - 16 = -7 (which is incorrect).\n\n   - Another common mathematical operation that seems to fit is exponentiation: A ¥ B = A^B - B^A. Testing this:\n     - 4 ¥ 2 = 4² - 2⁴ = 16 - 16 = [[0]] (correct).\n     - 3 ¥ 4 = 3⁴ - 4³ = 81 - 64 = [[17]] (correct).\n     - 5 ¥ X = 5ˣ - x⁵ = [[4]]. Solving this for X (testing X = 1): 5¹ - 1⁵ = 5 - 1 = [[4]]. Hence, X = [[1]] (correct).\n\n3. **Answer the final question: Compute 2¥3¥4:**\n\n   - Following the pattern A ¥ B = A^B - B^A:\n     - First, compute 2 ¥ 3: 2³ - 3² = 8 - 9 = -1.\n     - Then, use this outcome in the next operation -1 ¥ 4: (-1)⁴ - 4⁻¹. This evaluates to:\n     - 1 - 4⁻¹ = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 in fraction form.\n\nThus, applying the operation:\n\n[[3/4]]"}

By looking at the numbers:\n\n- If we subtract 2 from 4, we get 2, which doesn't quite give us 0.

For 5¥X=4, if we apply (5^2) + X = 4, we solve 25 + X = 4, thus X = -21, but the answer given is 1. This seems not right, so we need to re-examine the pattern.

(4◎1)+(2◎3) = [[10+20i]]\n2. (2◎1)−(2◎2) = [[3-4i]]\n3. (1◎3)+(X◎2) = -8+14i which gives X = [[2]]\n\nOne could hypothesize that the \"◎\" operation might apply some transformation to each input (say a transformation that can be expressed either directly or as a function based on a set of rules). Let's see if a pattern emerges to deduce the nature of the \"◎\" operation.\n\nFrom the given question-answer pair (1◎3)+(X◎2) = -8+14i and the solution X = 2, we deduce that:\n- (1◎3) must follow a pattern or rule that, when paired with (2◎2), the overall sum equals -8+14i. This leads us to believe:\n    - (1◎3) might equal a specific complex number, and \n    - (2◎2) might equal another specific complex number, \nwhich sum up to -8+14i.\n\nGiven the arbitrary and somewhat opaque nature of operations with \"◎\", and considering the need to calculate (4◎5)×(2◎3), we should follow a logical deduction or a rule that can be inferred from the examples.\n\nBy pattern recognition, the operations seem to produce results that involve both real and imaginary parts, often increasing or changing based on inputs. There's a complex arithmetic involved, but no clear definition of the \"◎\" operation was provided initially; hence, the exact rule needs to be inferred.\n\nHowever, for the following computation:\n- (4◎5)×(2◎3),\n\nGiven the examples, let's hypothesize these could yield another complex number. A conservative approach here, given the lack of additional specific rules, would be to consider an interpretation or pattern that aligns with the previously given results. Considering complex multiplication and the established patterns, we infer:\n\n((4◎5) and (2◎3)) leading to a product,\n\nFinally, applying complex multiplication rules (given the established outputs):\n[[48+16i]] is a plausible educated guess respecting the inferred operations from the examples.\n\nThus, we provide the answer as:\n[[48+16i]]."}

In each case, the operation \"△\" appears to be computing the derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) times \\(g(x)\\), then divided by \\(g(x)\\). However, from the provided examples, it seems that \"△\" is actually representing the quotient function \\(\\frac{f'(x) \\cdot g(x)}{g'(x) \\cdot f(x)}\\) or simplifying it, \\(\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\\) multiplied by some function that depends on \\(x\\) and \\(g(x)\\).\n\nFrom the examples, it's clear that \"△\" operation converts to a simplified form involving the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) in the most direct and simplified context—basically indicating the relative calculus impacts.\n\n1.

When the question is to compute \"1★4\", the answer is \"15\". This suggests a specific operation, not just simple arithmetic like addition or multiplication, is being applied between the numbers around the \"★\" symbol.\n\n2. For \"-2★3\", the answer given is \"5\". This again suggests a rule that applies equally whether the numbers are positive or negative.\n\n3. In the equation \"a★6=27\", we find that \"a\" can be either \"3\" or \"-3\". This indicates that the operation between \"a\" and \"6\" to result in \"27\" probably involves squaring or some form of squared-based operation where the sign of \"a\" doesn't affect the result.\n\nBy analyzing these, we deduce that the operation around \"★\" likely involves squaring the first number and adding the second, or some variation thereof. For instance, in \"1★4\", if we square the first number and then add the second, we get: \\(1^2 + 4 = 5\\), which is not the answer. However, if we adjust this to \\(1^2 + 2*4 = 15\\), this matches the given answer. Let's apply the potential rule of squaring the first number and then adding twice the second number:\n\n- For \"1★4\", \\((1^2) + 2*4 = 1 + 8 = 9 \\ne 15\\), this doesn't match. Correcting our rule as \\((1^2) + 2*4 + 6 = 15\\) seems more fitting.\n- For \"-2★3\", \\((-2^2) + 2*3 + 1 = 4 + 6 + (-1) = 9 \\ne 5\\), correction is needed. Let's check the actual pattern: \\((-2)^2 + 2*3 - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6\\).\n\nHowever, matching a consistent pattern is tricky without further examples. Considering the question, a simpler applicable rule seems to square the first number and add twice the second, no additional constants.

Given the domain is a discrete set of integer points, it's likely performing a summation over x and y in the given ranges.\n- In the first example, f(x,y)=1, meaning every term in the summation equals 1. With D being 1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, there are 2*3=6 terms, so the total is 6*1/3=[[2]].\n- In the second example, f(x,y)=xy. To compute this, we would sum up all possible xy values from the range:\n    - For x=1, y=1,2,3, the sum is 1+2+3=6.\n    - For x=2, y=1,2,3, the sum is 2+4+6=12.\n    - So the total is 6+12=18, but it seems the computed version was expected to be [[6]], which implies a possible division by the number of terms or another specific operation wasn't clear from the examples.\n- The third example applies similar logic with f(x,y)=x^2+y^2. The total for each x across y=1,2,3, summed and then adjusted to fit the format.\n  \nGiven the fourth question, f(x,y)=xy for 1≤x≤2, 0≤y≤1:\n\n- For x=1, y=0,1, the values are 1*0=0 and 1*1=1.\n- For x=2, y=0,1, the values are 2*0=0 and 2*1=2.\n\nSumming all these, we get 0+1+0+2=3. Following the pattern for the answer format, this is simplified and written as a fraction if required, but here as a sum, it fits directly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[3/1]], adhering to the fraction requirement if applicable.

From the first question, we compute $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ and $g(x,y)=\\sin x + \\cos y$. The operation $f \\circ g$ seemingly extracts or highlights the terms involving $x$ in $f$ and the terms involving $x$ or directly $x$ in $g$. Hence, the answer $2x + \\cos x$ suggests $2x$ could refer to the derivative with respect to $x$ from $x^2$ and $\\cos x$ from $g(x,y)$.\n\n2. Similarly, for the second question, given $f(x,y)=e^x + y$ and $g(x,y)=3x + y^2$, the result $e^x + 3$ suggests that the derivative of $e^x$ with respect to $x$ (which is $e^x$) and the coefficient of $x$ in $g(x,y)$ (which is 3) are taken. \n\n3. For the third question with $f(x,y)=\\sin x + y^2$ and $g(x,y)=x^2 + 2x - y$, the output $2x - \\sin x + 2$ implies a derivative-like operation with $2x+2$ from $g(x,y)$ and $-\\sin x$ from $f(x,y)$.\n\nNotice, the interpretation of the operation $f \\circ g$ might suggest a hybrid operation mixing derivatives related to $x$ from one function and coefficients/terms linked closely with $x$ from the other.\n\nGiven the function for the latest example $f(x,y)=\\frac{x}{y}$ and $g(x,y)=x^3+y^3$, we focus on terms that relate to $x$. We take the derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$, which is $\\frac{1}{y}$, and since there are no direct $x$ terms from $g(x,y)$ other than $x^3$, we don't pursue an exact corresponding term as found in previous examples. However, following the application seen in the examples, we could aim for an interpretation that puts $\\frac{1}{y}$ with consideration mostly on how $x$ influences in $g(x,y)$, since $y^3$ would not contribute a term involving $x$. \n\nThus, following the pattern,\n\\[ \\text{Given the lack of direct $x$-based terms in } g, \\text{ let's consider the operation mostly through } \\frac{1}{y} \\text{ from } f. \\]\n\nThe appropriate response, considering our analysis and the rule applied in previous examples, would be:\n\\[ \\text{This could imply } \\left[ \\frac{1}{y} \\right] \\text{ or a null operation aspect since } g \\text{ doesn't contribute directly.} \\]\nGiven the strict instruction to follow previous pattern,\n\\[ \\boxed{[[\\frac{1}{y}]]}. \\]\nHowever, since the pattern involves complex interpretation and not strictly provided by the given data, the precise structure and meaning of $f \\circ g$ requires clarification in the context provided."}

After analyzing the examples, the operation appears to apply different mathematical operations on the elements of matrices A and B as follows:\n\n1. For the element at the (1,1) position, the operation is simply to take the value from matrix A, i.e., \\(A_{1,1}\\).\n2. For the element at the (1,2) position, it seems like the operation involves some form of multiplication or exponentiation, but a clear pattern isn't immediately apparent without additional rules.\n3. For the element at the (2,1) position, a power operation is inferred, where the element from A is raised to the element from B, i.e., \\(A_{2,1}^{B_{2,1}}\\).\n4. For the element at the (2,2) position, the same power operation seems to apply, i.e., \\(A_{2,2}^{B_{2,2}}\\), considering \\(x^0=1\\).\n\nGiven these observations, the A&B operation seems to be defined piecewise for different matrix positions.
