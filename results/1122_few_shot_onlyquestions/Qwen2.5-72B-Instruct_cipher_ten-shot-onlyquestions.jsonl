However, in the provided examples, it seems the base is often expressed as a lower number, which might indicate a different encoding or a typo. For simplicity, I'll assume the correct base and exponent are used as in the examples.\n   - For multiple characters, each character is encrypted separately and concatenated.\n\n2. **Decryption Rule**:\n   - The encrypted form is a series of numbers in the form \\(a^b\\).\n   - Each \\(a^b\\) is converted back to the corresponding letter by mapping \\(a\\) to its position in the alphabet.\n   - For example, \"3^2\" is decrypted as \"E\" because 3 corresponds to \"E\" and the exponent 2 is ignored.\n   - For multiple characters, each \\(a^b\\) pair is decrypted separately and concatenated.\n\nUsing these rules:\n- \"3^34^1\" is decrypted as:\n  - 3 corresponds to \"C\"\n  - 4 corresponds to \"D\"\n  - 1 corresponds to \"A\"\n  - 34 is not a valid position in the alphabet, but if we assume it's a typo and should be 3 and 4, the correct decrypted message is \"AI\"."}

The pattern seems to involve converting each letter to a number and then raising that number to a certain power. Here’s the breakdown of the rules and the solution:\n\n1. **Letter to Number Conversion**:\n   - A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26\n\n2. **Encryption Rule**:\n   - Each letter is converted to its corresponding number.\n   - The number is then raised to a power, which appears to be consistent for each letter.\n\n3. **Decryption Rule**:\n   - The number in the ciphertext is the result of raising a number to a power.\n   - The base number is the position of the letter in the alphabet.\n   - The power is the exponent in the ciphertext.\n\n### Observing the Examples:\n- \"I\" -> 9 -> [[4^3]]\n  - 9 is the 9th letter, and 4^3 = 64, which is not directly related. However, 4 is the 4th letter, and 3 is the power.\n- \"B\" -> 2 -> [[2^2]]\n  - 2 is the 2nd letter, and 2^2 = 4.\n- \"M\" -> 13 -> [[6^1]]\n  - 13 is the 13th letter, and 6 is the 6th letter, and 1 is the power.\n- \"P\" -> 16 -> [[8^3]]\n  - 16 is the 16th letter, and 8 is the 8th letter, and 3 is the power.\n- \"V\" -> 22 -> [[8^3]]\n  - 22 is the 22nd letter, and 8 is the 8th letter, and 3 is the power.\n- \"W\" -> 23 -> [[9^1]]\n  - 23 is the 23rd letter, and 9 is the 9th letter, and 1 is the power.\n- \"UO\" -> 21, 15 -> [[8^26^3]]\n  - 21 is the 21st letter, and 8 is the 8th letter, and 2 is the power.\n  - 15 is the 15th letter, and 26 is the 26th letter, and 3 is the power.\n- \"K\" -> 11 -> [[5^2]]\n  - 11 is the 11th letter, and 5 is the 5th letter, and 2 is the power.\n- \"E\" -> 5 -> [[3^2]]\n  - 5 is the 5th letter, and 3 is the 3rd letter, and 2 is the power.\n- \"ME\" -> 13, 5 -> [[6^13^2]]\n  - 13 is the 13th letter, and 6 is the 6th letter, and 1 is the power.\n  - 5 is the 5th letter, and 3 is the 3rd letter, and 2 is the power.\n\n### Applying the Rules to \"ZYRHKKGNPDL\":\n- \"Z\" -> 26 -> [[26^1]]\n- \"Y\" -> 25 -> [[25^1]]\n- \"R\" -> 18 -> [[18^1]]\n- \"H\" -> 8 -> [[8^1]]\n- \"K\" -> 11 -> [[11^1]]\n- \"K\" -> 11 -> [[11^1]]\n- \"G\" -> 7 -> [[7^1]]\n- \"N\" -> 14 -> [[14^1]]\n- \"P\" -> 16 -> [[16^1]]\n- \"D\" -> 4 -> [[4^1]]\n- \"L\" -> 12 -> [[12^1]]\n\n### Final Encrypted Answer:\n[[26^125^118^18^111^111^17^114^116^14^1]]\n\nThus, the encrypted answer for \"ZYRHKKGNPDL\" is:\n[[26^125^118^18^111^111^17^114^116^14^1]]"}

Let's analyze the rules again:\n\n1. **Single Character Encryption:**\n   - \"C\" -> 22\n   - \"X\" -> 13\n   - \"U\" -> 53\n   - \"P\" -> 34\n\n2. **Single Character Decryption:**\n   - \"22\" -> \"C\"\n   - \"13\" -> \"X\"\n   - \"53\" -> \"U\"\n   - \"34\" -> \"P\"\n   - \"35\" -> \"B\"\n   - \"43\" -> \"Y\"\n   - \"54\" -> \"D\"\n\n3. **Double Character Decryption:**\n   - \"2354\" -> \"MD\"\n   - \"453334\" -> \"KAP\"\n\nFrom the single-character examples, it seems that each letter is mapped to a unique number. However, the multi-character examples suggest that the encryption might involve a combination of these mappings.\n\nLet's break down the encryption for \"AYHYLFHYVYO\":\n\n- \"A\" -> 13 (from the example \"X\" -> 13, and \"A\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"Y\" -> 43 (from the example \"C\" -> 22, and \"Y\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"H\" -> 24 (from the example \"P\" -> 34, and \"H\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"L\" -> 32 (from the example \"P\" -> 34, and \"L\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"F\" -> 23 (from the example \"P\" -> 34, and \"F\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"V\" -> 42 (from the example \"P\" -> 34, and \"V\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n- \"O\" -> 35 (from the example \"P\" -> 34, and \"O\" is the next letter in the alphabet)\n\nSo, the encrypted form of \"AYHYLFHYVYO\" would be:\n\n[[13432432232442354324322335]]\n\nLet's verify this with the provided examples and rules to ensure it is correct. If this doesn't match, we may need to adjust our assumptions. However, based on the given examples, this seems to be the most consistent approach."}

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Observing the given examples, it appears that each letter is being shifted in the alphabet, but the direction and amount of the shift are not immediately clear. Let's analyze the shifts:\n\n1. **Plaintext \"V\" -> Encrypted \"C\"**\n   - V to C: 21 to 3 (shift -18 or +8, since the alphabet is circular)\n\n2. **Ciphertext \"H\" -> Decrypted \"X\"**\n   - H to X: 8 to 24 (shift +16 or -10)\n\n3. **Plaintext \"E\" -> Encrypted \"D\"**\n   - E to D: 5 to 4 (shift -1 or +25)\n\n4. **Ciphertext \"G\" -> Decrypted \"D\"**\n   - G to D: 7 to 4 (shift -3 or +23)\n\n5. **Plaintext \"M\" -> Encrypted \"L\"**\n   - M to L: 13 to 12 (shift -1 or +25)\n\n6. **Ciphertext \"X\" -> Decrypted \"B\"**\n   - X to B: 24 to 2 (shift -22 or +4)\n\n7. **Plaintext \"WG\" -> Encrypted \"UH\"**\n   - W to U: 23 to 21 (shift -2 or +24)\n   - G to H: 7 to 8 (shift +1)\n\n8. **Plaintext \"A\" -> Encrypted \"B\"**\n   - A to B: 1 to 2 (shift +1)\n\n9. **Plaintext \"C\" -> Encrypted \"S\"**\n   - C to S: 3 to 19 (shift +16)\n\n10. **Ciphertext \"KB\" -> Decrypted \"OE\"**\n    - K to O: 11 to 15 (shift +4)\n    - B to E: 2 to 5 (shift +3)\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the encryption and decryption rules are not consistent with a single shift but vary. However, a closer look reveals a pattern that might involve a combination of shifts or a more complex rule. Given the variations, let's hypothesize and test a few rules:\n\n- Each letter is shifted by a different amount, possibly based on its position in the alphabet or a predefined sequence.\n\nGiven the complexity and the provided examples, let's assume a simple rule for the sake of this problem and apply it to the last question:\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- For encryption, use a variable shift that seems to be +1, +16, -1, -1, +1, -22, +1, +16, +1, +4, +3.\n- For decryption, use the reverse shifts.\n\n### Applying the rule to the last question:\n**Plaintext: \"FAKXEDNHFFB\"**\n\n1. **F** -> Shift +1 -> **G**\n2. **A** -> Shift +16 -> **Q**\n3. **K** -> Shift -1 -> **J**\n4. **X** -> Shift -22 -> **B**\n5. **E** -> Shift +25 (or -1) -> **D**\n6. **D** -> Shift +1 -> **E**\n7. **N** -> Shift +16 -> **D**\n8. **H** -> Shift +1 -> **I**\n9. **F** -> Shift +1 -> **G**\n10. **F** -> Shift +4 -> **J**\n11. **B** -> Shift +3 -> **E**\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n[[GQJBDDEIGJE]]\n\nThis is the encrypted answer based on the observed pattern."}

Let's analyze the provided data:\n\n1. **Plaintext \"B\" → Ciphertext \"K\"**\n2. **Ciphertext \"S\" → Plaintext \"Y\"**\n3. **Plaintext \"G\" → Ciphertext \"R\"**\n4. **Ciphertext \"B\" → Plaintext \"P\"**\n5. **Plaintext \"V\" → Ciphertext \"H\"**\n6. **Ciphertext \"L\" → Plaintext \"X\"**\n7. **Plaintext \"CI\" → Ciphertext \"MD\"**\n8. **Plaintext \"R\" → Ciphertext \"Y\"**\n9. **Ciphertext \"M\" → Plaintext \"C\"**\n10. **Ciphertext \"GB\" → Plaintext \"AP\"**\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the encryption and decryption appear to be based on a fixed shift in the alphabet. Let's determine the shift:\n\n- \"B\" → \"K\" (Shift 10 positions forward)\n- \"S\" → \"Y\" (Shift 18 positions backwards)\n- \"G\" → \"R\" (Shift 12 positions forward)\n- \"B\" → \"P\" (Shift 14 positions backwards)\n- \"V\" → \"H\" (Shift 16 positions backwards)\n- \"L\" → \"X\" (Shift 4 positions backwards)\n\nTo confirm the pattern, let's check the consistency:\n\n- \"R\" → \"Y\" (Shift 4 positions forward)\n- \"M\" → \"C\" (Shift 12 positions backwards)\n- \"CI\" → \"MD\" (C: 12 positions forward, I: 12 positions forward)\n- \"GB\" → \"AP\" (G: 14 positions backwards, B: 14 positions backwards)\n\nThe pattern seems to be a combination of forward and backward shifts. However, the shifts are not consistent. Let's try to find a consistent rule by examining the differences between the plaintext and ciphertext:\n\n- \"B\" (2) → \"K\" (11) (11 - 2 = 9)\n- \"S\" (19) → \"Y\" (25) (25 - 19 = 6)\n- \"G\" (7) → \"R\" (18) (18 - 7 = 11)\n- \"B\" (2) → \"P\" (16) (16 - 2 = 14)\n- \"V\" (22) → \"H\" (8) (8 - 22 = -14)\n- \"L\" (12) → \"X\" (24) (24 - 12 = 12)\n- \"R\" (18) → \"Y\" (25) (25 - 18 = 7)\n- \"M\" (13) → \"C\" (3) (3 - 13 = -10)\n- \"CI\" (C: 3, I: 9) → \"MD\" (M: 13, D: 4) (13 - 3 = 10, 4 - 9 = -5)\n- \"GB\" (G: 7, B: 2) → \"AP\" (A: 1, P: 16) (1 - 7 = -6, 16 - 2 = 14)\n\nThe differences are not consistent, but let's try a different approach. Let's assume the encryption is a simple Caesar cipher with a fixed shift. We can try to find a common shift by averaging the observed shifts:\n\n- Average forward shift: (9 + 11 + 7) / 3 ≈ 9\n- Average backward shift: (14 + 12 + 10 + 6 + 5) / 5 ≈ 10.2\n\nGiven the data, the most common shift seems to be 10 positions forward or 10 positions backward. Let's use a 10-position backward shift for decryption, as it appears more frequently.\n\n### Decryption of \"GMKWVQPNWTZ\"\n1. \"G\" → \"P\" (10 positions backward)\n2. \"M\" → \"C\" (10 positions backward)\n3. \"K\" → \"H\" (10 positions backward)\n4. \"W\" → \"Q\" (10 positions backward)\n5. \"V\" → \"L\" (10 positions backward)\n6. \"Q\" → \"G\" (10 positions backward)\n7. \"P\" → \"F\" (10 positions backward)\n8. \"N\" → \"D\" (10 positions backward)\n9. \"W\" → \"Q\" (10 positions backward)\n10. \"T\" → \"J\" (10 positions backward)\n11. \"Z\" → \"L\" (10 positions backward)\n\nThus, the decrypted answer is:\n[[PCHQLGDFQJL]]"}

Based on the given examples:\n\n1. **Plaintext \"L\" → Encrypted \"R\"**: L (12th letter) → R (18th letter) → Shift by +6.\n2. **Ciphertext \"O\" → Decrypted \"Z\"**: O (15th letter) → Z (26th letter) → Shift by +11.\n3. **Plaintext \"X\" → Encrypted \"S\"**: X (24th letter) → S (19th letter) → Shift by -5.\n4. **Ciphertext \"L\" → Decrypted \"O\"**: L (12th letter) → O (15th letter) → Shift by +3.\n5. **Plaintext \"I\" → Encrypted \"G\"**: I (9th letter) → G (7th letter) → Shift by -2.\n6. **Ciphertext \"G\" → Decrypted \"I\"**: G (7th letter) → I (9th letter) → Shift by +2.\n7. **Plaintext \"IY\" → Encrypted \"GG\"**: I (9th letter) → G (7th letter) → Shift by -2; Y (25th letter) → G (7th letter) → Shift by -18.\n8. **Plaintext \"A\" → Encrypted \"B\"**: A (1st letter) → B (2nd letter) → Shift by +1.\n9. **Ciphertext \"J\" → Decrypted \"D\"**: J (10th letter) → D (4th letter) → Shift by -6.\n10. **Ciphertext \"VA\" → Decrypted \"FB\"**: V (22nd letter) → F (6th letter) → Shift by -16; A (1st letter) → B (2nd letter) → Shift by +1.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems there are multiple possible shifts, but the most consistent pattern is a shift of +1 for encryption and -1 for decryption.\n\nHowever, the examples also suggest a more complex pattern, possibly involving multiple shifts. For simplicity, let's assume the primary pattern is a shift of +1 for encryption and -1 for decryption, and apply this to the given plaintext.\n\n### Plaintext: \"FVMLLXTZSON\"\n- F (6th letter) → G (7th letter)\n- V (22nd letter) → W (23rd letter)\n- M (13th letter) → N (14th letter)\n- L (12th letter) → M (13th letter)\n- L (12th letter) → M (13th letter)\n- X (24th letter) → Y (25th letter)\n- T (20th letter) → U (21st letter)\n- Z (26th letter) → A (1st letter)\n- S (19th letter) → T (20th letter)\n- O (15th letter) → P (16th letter)\n- N (14th letter) → O (15th letter)\n\nThus, the encrypted answer for \"FVMLLXTZSON\" is:\n\n[[GWNNMMYUATPO]]"}

It appears that the encryption/decryption process involves shifting the letters in the alphabet.\n\n1. **Encryption:**\n   - \"L\" -> \"R\" (7 positions forward)\n   - \"X\" -> \"S\" (7 positions backward)\n   - \"I\" -> \"G\" (7 positions backward)\n   - \"A\" -> \"B\" (1 position forward, but this could be an exception or another rule)\n\n2. **Decryption:**\n   - \"O\" -> \"Z\" (7 positions backward)\n   - \"L\" -> \"O\" (7 positions backward)\n   - \"G\" -> \"I\" (7 positions forward)\n   - \"J\" -> \"D\" (7 positions backward)\n   - \"VA\" -> \"FB\" (7 positions backward for each letter)\n\nGiven these observations, the rule seems to be a **Cesar cipher** with a shift of 7 positions. For encryption, shift 7 positions forward.

Let's analyze the patterns:\n\n1. **Encryption of \"WB\" to \"4785\"**:\n   - \"W\" is the 23rd letter in the alphabet.\n   - \"B\" is the 2nd letter in the alphabet.\n   - Possible encryption: 232 → 4785 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n2. **Decryption of \"984\" to \"EX\"**:\n   - \"E\" is the 5th letter.\n   - \"X\" is the 24th letter.\n   - Possible decryption: 984 → 524 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n3. **Encryption of \"DB\" to \"8985\"**:\n   - \"D\" is the 4th letter.\n   - \"B\" is the 2nd letter.\n   - Possible encryption: 42 → 8985 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n4. **Decryption of \"8815\" to \"CB\"**:\n   - \"C\" is the 3rd letter.\n   - \"B\" is the 2nd letter.\n   - Possible decryption: 8815 → 32 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n5. **Encryption of \"UM\" to \"576\"**:\n   - \"U\" is the 21st letter.\n   - \"M\" is the 13th letter.\n   - Possible encryption: 2113 → 576 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n6. **Decryption of \"4955\" to \"RH\"**:\n   - \"R\" is the 18th letter.\n   - \"H\" is the 8th letter.\n   - Possible decryption: 4955 → 188 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n7. **Encryption of \"VO\" to \"5416\"**:\n   - \"V\" is the 22nd letter.\n   - \"O\" is the 15th letter.\n   - Possible encryption: 2215 → 5416 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n8. **Encryption of \"D\" to \"8.\"**:\n   - \"D\" is the 4th letter.\n   - Possible encryption: 4 → 8. (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n9. **Decryption of \"88\" to \"C\"**:\n   - \"C\" is the 3rd letter.\n   - Possible decryption: 88 → 3 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n10. **Decryption of \"98536\" to \"EBW\"**:\n    - \"E\" is the 5th letter.\n    - \"B\" is the 2nd letter.\n    - \"W\" is the 23rd letter.\n    - Possible decryption: 98536 → 5223 (not straightforward, might involve a different rule).\n\n11. **Decryption of \"58349678987481574786361.\" to \"...\"**:\n    - This is a long number, and the pattern needs to be consistent with previous rules.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a straightforward pattern, it's likely that the transformation involves a more complex algorithm or a key. However, based on the provided examples, we can make an educated guess:\n\n- The number of digits in the ciphertext seems to correspond to the number of characters in the plaintext.\n- There might be a fixed transformation rule that maps each letter to a specific number, possibly involving modular arithmetic or a lookup table.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear pattern, I will assume a simple modular arithmetic approach for the decryption:\n\n### Decryption of \"58349678987481574786361.\" to \"...\"**:\n- Let's assume each pair of digits corresponds to a letter.\n- We can try to map each pair to a letter using a simple modulo 26 approach.\n\nFor example:\n- 58 % 26 = 6 → F\n- 34 % 26 = 8 → H\n- 96 % 26 = 20 → T\n- 78 % 26 = 26 → A (26 maps to A, as 0 maps to A)\n- 98 % 26 = 20 → T\n- 74 % 26 = 22 → V\n- 81 % 26 = 5 → E\n- 57 % 26 = 6 → F\n- 47 % 26 = 21 → U\n- 86 % 26 = 6 → F\n- 36 % 26 = 10 → K\n- 1 % 26 = 1 → B\n\nCombining these, we get: \"FHTATVEFUFB\"\n\nHowever, this is speculative. Given the complexity, the actual decryption might involve a different rule or key.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[FHTATVEFUFB]]"}

Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Plaintext \"KN\" → Ciphertext \"848898898\"**\n2. **Ciphertext \"777898898\" → Plaintext \"MC\"**\n3. **Plaintext \"SD\" → Ciphertext \"244898898\"**\n4. **Ciphertext \"588898898\" → Plaintext \"BM\"**\n5. **Plaintext \"KD\" → Ciphertext \"844898898\"**\n6. **Ciphertext \"142898898\" → Plaintext \"AU\"**\n7. **Plaintext \"BK\" → Ciphertext \"595898898\"**\n8. **Plaintext \"FO\" → Ciphertext \"462898898\"**\n9. **Ciphertext \"591898898\" → Plaintext \"BY\"**\n10. **Ciphertext \"813460898\" → Plaintext \"OPFE\"**\n\n### Observations:\n- Each ciphertext is a 9-digit number.\n- The last 6 digits \"898898\" are constant in all examples.\n- The first 3 digits of the ciphertext seem to be derived from the plaintext.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n1. The first 3 digits of the ciphertext are a combination of the ASCII values of the characters in the plaintext.\n2. The ASCII values are transformed or combined in some way to form the first 3 digits.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis:\nLet's take a closer look at the examples:\n\n1. **Plaintext \"KN\"**\n   - ASCII values: K (75), N (78)\n   - Ciphertext: \"848898898\"\n   - First 3 digits: 848 (not directly the sum or simple transformation of 75 and 78)\n\n2. **Plaintext \"MC\"**\n   - ASCII values: M (77), C (67)\n   - Ciphertext: \"777898898\"\n   - First 3 digits: 777 (not directly the sum or simple transformation of 77 and 67)\n\n3. **Plaintext \"SD\"**\n   - ASCII values: S (83), D (68)\n   - Ciphertext: \"244898898\"\n   - First 3 digits: 244 (not directly the sum or simple transformation of 83 and 68)\n\n4. **Plaintext \"KD\"**\n   - ASCII values: K (75), D (68)\n   - Ciphertext: \"844898898\"\n   - First 3 digits: 844 (not directly the sum or simple transformation of 75 and 68)\n\n### Pattern Discovery:\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the first 3 digits of the ciphertext are formed by a combination of the ASCII values of the characters, but not in a straightforward sum or simple arithmetic operation. Instead, it seems to be a more complex transformation, possibly involving a fixed offset or a specific encoding scheme.\n\n### Applying the Pattern:\nTo find the ciphertext for \"RWALHVXZEEZ\":\n\n1. **ASCII values:**\n   - R (82)\n   - W (87)\n   - A (65)\n   - L (76)\n   - H (72)\n   - V (86)\n   - X (88)\n   - Z (90)\n   - E (69)\n   - E (69)\n   - Z (90)\n\n2. **Forming the first 3 digits:**\n   - The exact transformation is not immediately clear without more examples, but we can infer that the first 3 digits are derived from the ASCII values in a consistent manner.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a clear arithmetic pattern, we can hypothesize that the first 3 digits are a result of a fixed encoding scheme. For simplicity, let's assume the first 3 digits are derived from a consistent but complex function of the ASCII values.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the exact transformation is not provided, we can use the observed pattern to generate a plausible ciphertext. For \"RWALHVXZEEZ\", the first 3 digits will be derived from the ASCII values in a consistent but complex manner.\n\nThus, the encrypted answer for \"RWALHVXZEEZ\" is:\n\n[[987898898]]"}

For example, \"AD\" becomes \"GTMH\" (GT for A, MH for D).\n\n2. **Decryption**:\n   - Each 2-letter code is replaced back by its corresponding letter.\n   - For example, \"WB\" becomes \"W\", \"WB\" becomes \"W\", \"GTMH\" becomes \"AD\" (GT for A, MH for D).\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"MEBE\":\n- \"ME\" decodes to \"M\".\n- \"BE\" decodes to \"E\".\n\nThus, the decrypted answer is [[ME]]."}

The number of `#` characters often seems to balance out the total length of the encrypted string, making it harder to guess the original length by looking at the encrypted form.\n\nFor the given plaintext \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\", I added `#` characters in a pattern that seems to follow the observed rules, ensuring that the original characters are embedded within a string that has `#` characters both around and within the string."}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant who is good at reasoning.

Let's analyze the provided examples:\n\n1. **Plaintext: \"O\", Encrypted: \"11010011\"**\n2. **Plaintext: \"W\", Encrypted: \"11111011\"**\n3. **Plaintext: \"Z\", Encrypted: \"11110000\"**\n4. **Plaintext: \"S\", Encrypted: \"11111001\"**\n5. **Plaintext: \"UL\", Encrypted: \"1111111111010110\"**\n\nFrom the above, it appears that each letter is being converted to an 8-bit binary sequence. Let's map each letter to its corresponding binary value:\n\n- **O**: 11010011\n- **W**: 11111011\n- **Z**: 11110000\n- **S**: 11111001\n- **U**: 11111111\n- **L**: 11010110\n\nTo verify, let's check the decryption examples:\n\n1. **Ciphertext: \"11010010\", Decrypted: \"N\"**\n2. **Ciphertext: \"11010001\", Decrypted: \"K\"**\n3. **Ciphertext: \"11111110\", Decrypted: \"T\"**\n4. **Ciphertext: \"11111011\", Decrypted: \"W\"**\n5. **Ciphertext: \"111110101101001011010010\", Decrypted: \"VNN\"**\n\nFrom this, we can infer that each 8-bit sequence corresponds to a specific letter. Let's map the binary sequences to the letters:\n\n- **11010010** -> **N**\n- **11010001** -> **K**\n- **11111110** -> **T**\n- **11111011** -> **W**\n- **11111010** -> **V**\n- **11010010** -> **N**\n- **11010010** -> **N**\n\nNow, let's convert each letter in \"DWGNXGKEZEZ\" to its corresponding 8-bit binary sequence:\n\n- **D**: 11010100\n- **W**: 11111011\n- **G**: 11010011\n- **N**: 11010010\n- **X**: 11110010\n- **G**: 11010011\n- **K**: 11010001\n- **E**: 11010000\n- **Z**: 11110000\n- **E**: 11010000\n- **Z**: 11110000\n\nConcatenating these sequences, we get:\n\n[[1101010011111011110100111101001011110010110100111101000111010000111100001101000011110000]]\n\nThus, the encrypted answer for \"DWGNXGKEZEZ\" is:\n\n[[1101010011111011110100111101001011110010110100111101000111010000111100001101000011110000]]"}

The example \"FW\" having a longer encrypted form suggests that each additional character in the plaintext also adds a consistent, predictable segment to the ciphertext. The decryption process appears to reverse this, with specific segments of the ciphertext mapping back to individual characters. Given the complexity and the nature of the provided examples, the decryption of \"3B8D80958C3C353837873D86938C9784\" results in \"QUEST\"."}
