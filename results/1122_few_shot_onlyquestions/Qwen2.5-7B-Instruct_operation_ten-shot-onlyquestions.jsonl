When \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), \\(a ※ b = \\frac{a}{b} + C\\).\n2. When \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), \\(a ※ b = \\frac{b}{a} + C\\).\n3. If neither \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\) nor \\(b\\) is a multiple of \\(a\\), \\(a ※ b = 24\\).\n\nAnd we know from the example: \\(10 ※ 2 = 9\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify \\(C\\) from the given example:**\n   \\[\n   10 ※ 2 = \\frac{10}{2} + C\n   \\]\n   Given this equals 9:\n   \\[\n   5 + C = 9 \\implies C = 4\n   \\]\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n\n2. **Compute \\(19※28※4※(X※13) = 3\\):**\n   Let’s break this down:\n   - First, compute \\(19 ※ 28\\):\n     - Since 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19, by the rule, \\(19 ※ 28 = 24\\).\n   - Next, compute \\(24※4\\):\n     - Since 24 is a multiple of 4, \\(24 ※ 4 = \\frac{24}{4} + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\\).\n   - Then, compute \\(10 ※ (X※13) = 3\\):\n     - We need to consider different scenarios for \\(X ※ 13\\):\n       - If \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, then \\(X ※ 13 = \\frac{X}{13} + 4\\).\n       - If 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\), then it implies \\(X = 13\\) (as \\(X\\) must be a positive integer), so \\(13 ※ 13 = \\frac{13}{13} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\\), which is not 3, so this case is invalid.\n       - If neither 13 is a multiple of \\(X\\) nor \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, then \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\). So, we have:\n         \\[\n         10 ※ 24 = \\frac{10}{24} + 4 = \\frac{5}{12} + 4 = 4 \\frac{5}{12}\n         \\]\n         This is not 3 either.\n         - Now, assume \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, say \\(X = 13k\\) (where \\(k\\) is an integer):\n           \\[\n           13k ※ 13 = \\frac{13k}{13} + 4 = k + 4\n           \\]\n           For \\(10 ※ (k + 4) = 3\\), we need:\n           - \\(k + 4\\) must be a multiple of 10, or \\(k + 4 = 10m\\) for some integer \\(m\\), so:\n             \\[\n             k = 10m - 4\n             \\]\n             We need \\(10 ※ 10m = \\frac{10}{10m} + 4 = \\frac{1}{m} + 4 = 3\\). Solving this for integer \\(m\\), gives \\(m = 1\\), so \\(k = 6\\). Since \\(X = 13k = 13 \\times 6 = 78\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe valid \\(X\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(X = 78\\), and since no other values can fit, the solution is:\n\\[ [[78]] \\]"}

The modulus operation \\( A \\% B \\) returns the remainder when \\( A \\) is divided by \\( B \\). In this case, \\( 1 \\% X = 3 \\) implies that when 1 is divided by \\( X \\), the remainder is 3. \n\nFor the remainder to be 3, \\( X \\) must be greater than 3 (since the remainder cannot be equal to or greater than the divisor). The smallest possible \\( X \\) would be 4 because \\( 1 \\% 4 = 1 \\) would not satisfy the equation, and the next value is \\( X = 4 \\), but that also does not work. \n\nActually, the smallest \\( X \\) that can satisfy this is 4, because \\( 1 \\div 4 \\) gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1, and the closest \\( X \\) that can give a remainder of 3 when 1 is divided by it is \\( X = 4 \\) but it doesn't work.

The expression \\(X \\% 3\\) gives the remainder when \\(X\\) is divided by 3. Therefore, \\(X \\% 3 = 30\\) is not possible because the remainder when dividing by 3 cannot be greater than 2. The correct interpretation should be that the remainder is 0 if 30 is meant to imply that \\(X\\) is a multiple of 3. However, if we strictly follow the problem's condition as given, it would imply there's an error since a remainder cannot be 30.\n\nGiven the problem's format and the previous examples, it might be a misinterpretation or a special case. If we assume the problem means \\(X \\% 3 = 0\\) (i.e., \\(X\\) is a multiple of 3), then \\(X\\) can be any multiple of 3.

Add the corresponding elements of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1+0 & 2+1 \\\\ 3+2 & 4+3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 5 & 7 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nBut none of the previous answers follow this; the pattern seems to be \\( \\text{result} = 4 \\times (A + B) \\):\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 5 & 7 \\end{pmatrix} \\times 4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\times 4 & 3 \\times 4 \\\\ 5 \\times 4 & 7 \\times 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 12 \\\\ 20 & 28 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nNone of those fit either. The simplest pattern, if it's trying to be addition:\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 \\\\ 5 & 7 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nGiven the provided answer format and without clear context for the € operation, it seems there may be a unique or hidden pattern. Follow the general addition of matrices directly.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[\n[[((3,5),(9,13))]]\n\\]"}
