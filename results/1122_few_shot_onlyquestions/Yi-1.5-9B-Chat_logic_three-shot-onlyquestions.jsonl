The resolution principle involves negating one literal from each clause and then disjunction (ORing) them together.\n\nGiven:\nC1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬s\nC2 = ¬p ∨ q ∨ r\n\nWe can see that C1 has 'p' and C2 has '¬p'. Applying the resolution principle, we negate 'p' from C1 making it '¬p', and then OR them with the rest of the literals from each clause. This results in:\n\n1. Negating 'p' from C1 and ORing with all remaining literals from C2: ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬s ∨ q ∨ r\n2. Negating '¬p' from C2 and ORing with all remaining literals from C1: p ∨ ¬q ∨ рт с ∨ ¬r\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n### Answer:\n[[¬q∨¬s∨q∨r];[p∨¬q∨¬s∨¬r]]"}

'fJ' is addition, and 'gJ' is multiplication.\n\n4. **Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.**\n   - This is the relation defined on the set of natural numbers.

When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words.

Since both premises are particular statements (∀M⇒P is particular due to the existential import of none of the M are P, and ∃M⇒S is particular), the conclusion is particular as well (∃S⇒P).

The type of syllogism can be determined by looking at the quality (\"A\" for affirmatives and \"E\" for negations) and quantity (\"M\" for particular, \"M\" for middle, and \"I\" for universal) of the propositions.\n\n3. The answers provided ([III];[AAI]) correspond to the figure (III) and mood (AAI) of the syllogism.\n\n4. To fill in the parentheses, we use the quality and quantity of the propositions from the examples to determine the appropriate term to fill in the blank.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\nP()M\nSEM\n∴S()P\n\nWe can see that the first premise is a universal affirmation (\"I\" for quantity and \"A\" for quality), and the second premise is a subalternation (specifically, a particular negation). Since the conclusion should maintain the same quality as the premises (affirmative), the missing terms should be a universal particular (\"I\" for quality and \"M\" for quantity in the first premise, and \"I\" for quality and \"P\" for quantity in the conclusion).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[M];[P]]."}

The second statement is M()S, which is (Premise - Minor). The mood will also depend on whether it's affirmative or negative.

The first question asks to fill in the parentheses for the syllogism MAP - S()M - ∴SAP.

The second question asks to fill in the parentheses for the syllogism MOP - M()S - ∴SO(). The answer \"A\" and \"P\" indicate that the first argument is universal affirmation (A) and the second is particular negation (O), leading to a conclusion that is particular negation (O).\n\n4. The fourth question asks to fill in the parentheses for the syllogism MIP - M()S - ∴S()P.

The first task involves symbolizing a modal proposition in the format [[$t]], where \"t\" denotes \"Technology is a blessing.\" The answer to this question is [[$t]], indicating that the proposition \"Technology may be a blessing\" is symbolized using the modal operator \"may\" and denoted by $t.\n\n2. The second task asks to determine the relationship between two sentences, \"This new policy will definitely be implemented\" and \"This new policy will definitely not be implemented,\" from the given options. Both sentences have a contradictory relationship, so the answer is [[B]], indicating that the relationship is classified under \"x\" which stands for contradiction.\n\n3. The third task requires identifying the number of modal logic inference formulas that can infer \"Early preparation necessarily leads to success\" implies \"Early preparation cannot possibly not lead to success.\" Since this is a single inference formula, the answer is [[1]].\n\n4. The final question asks for the truth-value modal reasoning formula corresponding to \"Arrogance necessarily results in falling behind\" implying \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind.\" Similar to the third task, this single inference corresponds to one truth-value modal reasoning formula, so the answer is again [[1]].\n\nBy observing the pattern in these answers, the rule being applied is to identify the symbolic representation or classification (such as relationship or modal operator) that corresponds to the given propositions or inferences, and then to represent that symbolically as required by the format given (e.g., [[$t]], [[B]], [[1]])."}

This means that if statement A leads to statement B, and statement B also leads to statement A, then there is an equivalence between the two statements. In this case, the statements \"Elderly abuse is prohibited\" and \"Elderly abuse is not allowed\" are equivalent, as are \"Elder abuse is not allowed\" and \"Elder abuse is prohibited\". This type of reasoning is fundamental in logic and semantics, as it establishes a clear and direct correspondence between two expressions with identical meanings or opposite implications."}

In the first instance, we were tasked with symbolizing the proposition \"Using a phone in public places is not allowed\". We were told to let the variable 'p' represent the proposition 'Using a phone in public places'. The answer format was asked to be presented in '[]' and we found out that it's represented as '[[‽p]]', where '‽' symbolizes 'not allowed'. \n\n2. In the second part, the relationship between the two sentences \"It is allowed to take breaks during working hours.\" and \"Taking breaks during working hours is not allowed\" was sought. The correct relationship was found to be 'x' which denotes negation, so the answer format was '[[B]]'. \n\n3. For the third question, we were required to identify the canonical reasoning formulas that correspond to the inferences: \"There is an obligation to study\" from \"It is not allowed to not study\" and vice versa. The correct formula was identified as \"1\", indicating a contraposition, and hence the answer was presented as '[[1]]'.\n\n4. Finally, we had to find out what kind of relationship Modal Reasoning Formula 7 corresponds to. The correct relationship was identified as 'x', representing negation, so the answer format was '[[B]]'. \n\nThis pattern of rules implies that when presented with modal propositions (those asserting possibility, necessity, permission, obligation etc.), we are looking for negations ('x') or contrapositions (\"1\")."}

The statement \"Lao Chen has always worked diligently in the past\" implies a consistent pattern of behavior in the past. Formula 5, when applied to this statement, would likely lead to an inference that negates any contrary claim about Lao Chen's past work ethic. Thus, option A correctly represents the inference that \"It is not the case that Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past,\" which reaffirms the consistent, diligent work ethic described in the original statement.

Given that the answer to the question about sequential commands is `[[[c1 ; c2 ]φ]]`, we use this format for `c1` followed by `c2`, which is `[[⟨c1 ; c2⟩φ]]`.\n\n2. **Choice Rule (c1 + c2)**: The plus sign (+) is used to denote that either `c1` or `c2` can occur. This is evident in the initial question where it asks for the possibility that `φ` could be true after executing either `c1` or `c2`, answered with `[[⟨c1 +c2 ⟩φ]]`.\n\n3. **Applying the Choice Rule to the Sequence**: The last question combines the sequence of `c1` followed by `c2` with the independent execution of `c2`, which can occur after the sequence due to its nature (answering the condition that `φ` remains true after an additional independent execution of `c2`). Therefore, we apply the choice rule to the sequence of commands, resulting in `[[⟨(c1 ; c2) + c2⟩φ]]`, indicating that after the sequence of `c1` followed by `c2`, the condition `φ` remains true even if `c2` is executed independently afterward."}

This suggests the **Choice Rule** (C), as it allows for the possibility of `φ` being true after either `c1` or `c2`.\n\n2. **Question 2** and **Answer 2**: When `c1` and `c2` are sequential commands, the expression `[ c1  ][ c2  ]φ` simplifies to `[[[c1 ;c2 ]φ]]`. This reflects the **Sequence Rule** (B), indicating that `c1` follows `c2` in a sequential manner.\n\n3. **Question 3** and **Answer 3**: The scenario where a command `c` can be executed as many times as needed until a condition `φ` is met corresponds to the **Loop Rule** (B).\n\n4. **Question 4** and **Answer 4**: The situation where an exception `e` may be triggered after the execution of the command `c1` is governed by the **Interruption Rule** (F), as it deals with an exception or interruption in the flow of command execution.\n\n### Last Question:\nGiven the above explanations, what rule governs the behavior of commands when a condition `φ` triggers the execution of a specific command `c` a fixed number of times in a sequence?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]] (Choice Rule) - Although the question describes a scenario where a command is executed a fixed number of times based on a condition, the closest matching rule from the given options is the **Choice Rule** (C), as it involves a repeated decision-making process based on a condition until a certain criterion is met. This scenario doesn't neatly fit into a single one of the mentioned rules like a loop or a strict sequence with interruptions, making the **Choice Rule** the most adaptable to describe the iterative nature of choosing to execute a command based on a condition up to a certain number of times."}

In the examples given, when objects are in motion (rubbing hands, striking stones, hammering an iron block), heat is generated. When they are not in motion (no rubbing, striking, or hammering), heat is not generated. Therefore, the movement of objects can be inferred as the cause of generating heat."}

This method is used to infer causation by looking for patterns or correlations in the order of events. In the given scenario, the researchers observed that the area with a relatively higher concentration of textiles had a greater amount of ground subsidence, which led them to conclude that the common situation of high numbers of deep wells and high volume of underground water use in textile factories was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.

Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented.
