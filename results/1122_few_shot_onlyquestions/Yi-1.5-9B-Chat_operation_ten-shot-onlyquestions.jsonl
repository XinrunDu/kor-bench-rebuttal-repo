The answer is formatted as a fraction or a sum of logarithms depending on the inputs. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the rules derived from the examples:\n\n1. If both numbers are the same (e.g., 2 ￠ 2), the result is a half of the sum of the logarithms of the numbers to each other (e.g., 2 ￠ 2 = 1/2 * (log(2, 2) + log(2, 2)) = 5/2).\n2. If one of the numbers is an integer power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) and the other number is an integer power of 3 (e.g., 3, 9, 27, 81, etc.), the result is 10/3 or 5/2 depending on the specific numbers.\n3. If one of the numbers is a perfect cube (e.g., 27, 64, 125, etc.) and the other number is 1, the result is a sum of logarithms of the form \\log_{b}{a} + \\log_{a}{b}.\n4. If one of the numbers is a perfect square and the other number is a prime number and the base (second number) is not 2 or 3, the result is a fraction whose numerator is the product of the two numbers and the denominator is 3 times the first number.\n5. In cases where the result is not an integer or fraction, it is expressed as a sum of logarithms of the form \\log_{b}{a} + \\log_{a}{b}.\n\nUsing these rules, we can solve the last question:\n\nIf 3 ￠ X = 17/4, find X.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation in terms of logarithms:\n\nx = 3 ￠ X\n3 ￠ X = 17/4\n\nSince we know that 3 ￠ X is a function involving logarithms, we need to find a way to express 17/4 in terms of logarithms involving 3. However, none of the patterns described above directly match this form. Given the information provided, it's not straightforward to deduce X from the equation 3 ￠ X = 17/4 using the rules outlined in the examples.\n\nThe examples do not provide a direct rule for solving for X in the case where 3 ￠ X equals a fraction other than 10/3 or 5/2. Therefore, applying the rules as they are given, we cannot determine a simple fraction or integer solution for X. The answer should be given as a number, but without additional information or rules, we cannot deduce X from the given equation.\n\nIf the function \"￠\" follows a pattern specific to the digits 3 and X, or if there is an error in the interpretation of the rules from the given examples, further clarification would be needed to find X. As per the provided information, the closest we can get is to acknowledge that the answer should be a number that, when used in place of X in the equation 3 ￠ X, results in 17/4, but without a direct rule or pattern for this specific case."}

Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. When the operation is applied to two distinct numbers (e.g., 2 ￠ 8), the result is a fraction with the numerator being the sum of the two numbers and the denominator being the difference between them (e.g., 2 + 8 = 10 and 8 - 2 = 6, so 10/6 which simplifies to 5/3).\n\n2. When the operation is applied to a number and a power of itself (e.g., 2 ￠ 2 ￠ 4), the result is the same as applying the operation to the base number and the power (e.g., 2 ￠ 4 = 5/3 as established before).\n\n3. When the operation is applied to a number and a power of another number (e.g., 5 ￠ 8), and if the result cannot be reduced to an integer or fraction, the answer is given in the form of the sum of two logarithms.\n\n4. There are cases where the operation is applied to numbers that result in a fraction with a numerator that is not the sum of the numbers but is a power of one of the numbers (e.g., 16 ￠ 256 and 9 ￠ 243 both result in 5/2).\n\nNow, let's apply the observed rule to the last question:\n\nQuestion: Compute 7 ￠ 49.\n\nAccording to the pattern, we should apply the operation to 7 and 49. The operation results in a fraction with the numerator being the sum of the two numbers and the denominator being the difference between them.\n\n7 + 49 = 56\n49 - 7 = 42\n\nSo, the result is 56/42. Simplifying this fraction gives us 8/6, which further simplifies to 4/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[4 /3]]"}

The pattern seems to be as follows:\n\nFor a given expression (a ⊕ b), the operation is performed as follows:\n\n- If 'a' and 'b' are both integers, then (a ⊕ b) = a × b.\n- If 'a' or 'b' is a complex number in the form of (c + di), then (a ⊕ (c + di)) = a × (c + di), where a is multiplied with both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. If 'a' is an integer and 'b' is a complex number, the operation is similar.\n\nBased on these rules, we can now solve the last question:\n\nCompute (2 ⊕3 )×(1 ⊕X) = -10 + 11 i.\n\nStep 1: Apply the operation to (2 ⊕3 ):\n(2 ⊕3 ) = 2 × 3 = 6.\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the expression with the result from step 1:\n6 × (1 ⊕ X) = -10 + 11 i.\n\nStep 3: Apply the operation to (1 ⊕ X):\nSince 1 is an integer and X is a variable, we can assume that X is a complex number in the form of (a + bi). So, (1 ⊕ (a + bi)) = 1 × (a + bi) = a + bi.\n\nStep 4: Rewrite the expression from step 3:\n6 × (a + bi) = 6a + 6bi.\n\nStep 5: Equate the real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: 6a = -10\nImaginary part: 6b = 11\n\nStep 6: Solve for X (a and b):\na = -10 / 6 = -5 / 3\nb = 11 / 6\n\nSince a is the real part of the complex number X, and we are asked to find X as a number (not a complex number), we only need the value of the real part:\n\nX = a = -5 / 3.\n\nHowever, based on the previous examples and the given answers, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the questions or the operation ⊕. The last question specifically asks for the value of X as a number, not as a complex number. In this case, and based on the pattern observed in the previous examples, where we are only multiplying by the real part of the complex number, the answer should be the real part of X, which is -5 / 3.\n\nTherefore, the value of X is: [[-5 / 3]]."}

The exact definition of this operation is not clear from the given examples, but we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. When the operation involves a pair of real numbers, the result is a complex number.\n2. The real and imaginary parts of the result seem to be dependent on the specific numbers being operated on, but there is no clear linear relationship given in the examples provided.\n3. The operation is commutative, as the order of the numbers being operated on does not change the result (e.g., (2 ◎3) = (3 ◎2)).\n4. The operation is not specifically defined for the case when both numbers are the same (like (1 ◎1) or (2 ◎2)), but in those cases, the result is still a complex number.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nCompute (2 ◎1 )+(2 ◎Y).\nIf the answer is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nTo solve this, we first need to find the operation result for (2 ◎1). Looking at the previous examples, we can see that (2 ◎1) = 3 - 4i.\n\nNow, let's denote the result of (2 ◎Y) as A + Bi. We know that the sum of these two results should be a complex number in the form of x + yi. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n(3 - 4i) + (A + Bi) = x + yi\n\nBy comparing the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n3 + A = x (real parts)\n-4 + B = y (imaginary parts)\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine A and B directly from the given examples. However, we can note that since the operation is commutative, (2 ◎Y) should be the same as (Y ◎2). We can use this to find Y in the question (3 ◎Y)−(2 ◎1)=5 +2 i, from which we previously found Y = 3.\n\nNow, to find the answer for (2 ◎1 )+(2 ◎Y), we substitute Y with 3:\n\n(2 ◎1) + (2 ◎3) = 3 - 4i + (2 ◎3)\n\nWe still don't have the explicit form of (2 ◎3), but we can use the fact that Y = 3 from the previous question to infer that (2 ◎Y) when Y = 3 would be the same as (2 ◎3). Since we are adding (2 ◎1) to it, the result will be a complex number of the form x + yi, but we cannot determine the exact values of x and y without more information about the operation ◎.\n\nGiven the limitations and the lack of a clear operation definition, we can only provide the format for the answer:\n\n[[x + yi]]\n\nWhere x and y are some real numbers that would result from the operation (2 ◎3), which we do not have enough information to compute directly from the given examples."}

The complex number added appears to be based on the operation's order, with the first number being 1 or 2, and the second number being 3 or 5 in the examples provided.\n\nLet's analyze the last question:\nCompute (2 ◎X) + (1 ◎3) = -8 + 16 i\n\nFirst, we need to find the result of (2 ◎X). We know that ◎ is an operation that multiplies the numbers and adds a complex number based on the order. Since the second number in the operation is X, we can assume that the complex number added will be based on X and the number 5, as it was in the previous examples.\n\nLet's denote the complex number added by C(X), which depends on X:\nC(X) = aX + b\n\nFrom the given examples, we can deduce the pattern for C(X):\nC(1) = 2i\nC(2) = 4i\nC(3) = -5 + 4i\nC(4) = -16\nC(5) = -20 + 20i\n\nNow, let's apply the operation to (2 ◎X):\n(2 ◎X) = 2X * X + C(X)\n= 2X^2 + (aX + b)\n\nFor (1 ◎3), the operation would be:\n(1 ◎3) = 1 * 3 + C(3)\n= 3 - 5 + 4i\n= -2 + 4i\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n(2 ◎X) + (1 ◎3) = -8 + 16i\n2X^2 + (aX + b) + (-2 + 4i) = -8 + 16i\n\nWe can equate the real parts and the imaginary parts:\nReal part: 2X^2 - 2 = -8\nImaginary part: aX = 12\n\nFrom the real part, we can solve for X:\n2X^2 = 6\nX^2 = 3\nX = √3 (or -√3, but since a number squared should be positive, X = √3)\n\nFrom the imaginary part, we can determine the value of a:\na * √3 = 12\na = 12 / √3 = 4√3\n\nHowever, we know from the given examples that a should be 1 or 2. Since a = 4√3 doesn't fit the pattern, we need to adjust our assumption about the function C(X). It appears that C(X) consists of two parts: one is the multiplication of the two numbers in the operation, and the other is the difference between the original second number and the current X.\n\nLet's revise C(X) using this information:\nC(X) = 2X - 2 + 2i\n\nNow, the operation for (2 ◎X) would be:\n(2 ◎X) = 2X * X + C(X)\n= 2X^2 + (2X - 2 + 2i)\n\nFor this question, X should be such that:\n2X^2 + (2X - 2 + 2i) + (-2 + 4i) = -8 + 16i\n\nBy equating the real parts and imaginary parts, we get:\n2X^2 + 2X - 4 = -8\n2X = 4\nX = 2\n\nThus, the value of X is 2."}
