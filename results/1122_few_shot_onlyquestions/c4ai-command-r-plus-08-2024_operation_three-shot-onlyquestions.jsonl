'♂' and '♀' may stand for subtraction and division, with the numerical result remaining the same despite the operations occurring in the reverse order of standard notation. From the first question, we can deduce a basiclication fact: 6×8=48. We can then determine 'X' by using the given equation, resulting in (X△4)○6=X×4+6=34, which gives X=7. When applying the revised operations to 5○(3△8), we get 5+(3+8)/2=5+11/2=5+11/2=16, using △ as addition and ○ as regular multiplication. The operations ♂ and ♀ appear to reverse the order of operations, such that 7♂(6♀2) becomes (7-6)/2=1/2, or 0.5 since there is no decimal permitted.\n\nSo, to answer your last question, the result is **[[0.5]] or [[1/2]]**, depending on your preferred format."}

In the given examples, the questions are asking for the modular inverse of the first number with respect to the second number.\n\nFor example, in the first question, 2%3, the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 is calculated as follows:\n2 * x ≡ 1 (mod 3)\nThis equation means we are looking for a number x such that when multiplied by 2 and then divided by 3, the remainder is 1. In this case, x=2 is a solution because:\n2 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nSolving for x in this equation involves using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or other methods.\n\nNow, for the final question:\n7%2\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 7 modulo 2, we set up the equation:\n7 * x ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nThere is no solution for this equation, because any number multiplied by 7 will always be even when divided by 2, resulting in a remainder of 0, not 1. Therefore, the modular inverse does not exist in this case.\n\nSo, the answer to the last question is that there is no valid modular inverse, and the equation cannot be satisfied."}

When two numbers are combined using '⊕', the result is a complex number whose real part is the sum of the two numbers and whose imaginary part is the difference of the two numbers multiplied by 'i'. This can be represented as:\n   a ⊕ b = (a + b) + (b - a)i\n2. The '⊕' operation has a higher precedence than addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n3. To solve for an unknown variable using '⊕', the isolated term should also involve the '⊕' operation to ensure consistency in the rules.\n\nApplying these rules to your final question, I will solve it step by step:\n\n1. First, I calculate the value of (2⊕1):\n   2 ⊕ 1 = (2 + 1) + (1 - 2)i = 3 - i\n2. Next, I multiply this result by 3:\n   3 * (3 - i) = 9 - 3i\n3. Then, I calculate the value of (1⊕3):\n   1 ⊕ 3 = (1 + 3) + (3 - 1)i = 4 + 2i\n4. Finally, I subtract the result of step 3 from the result of step 2:\n   9 - 3i - (4 + 2i) = 5 - i\n\nSo, the answer is:\n[[5 - i]]"}

Assuming “◎” represents the standard complex multiplication, I will interpret and apply the rules as follows:\n\n1. According to the first question, (4 ◎ 1) + (2 ◎ 3) = 10 + 20i. This implies that the “◎” represents complex multiplication, and the 2◎3 means the multiplication of 3 by 2i, since only this operation results in a term with a nonzero imaginary coefficient. Therefore:\n- 1 ◎ z = z for any complex number z\n- n ◎ z = nz for any integer n and complex number z\n\n2. In the second question, (2 ◎ 1) − (2 ◎ 2) = 3 − 4i. \n\nSo 2 ◎ 2 = 3 − 4i implies that 2 ◎ 1 = −4i. Because of the definition of complex multiplication, one of the interpretations could be:\n- 1 ◎ z = iz for any complex number z\n\n3. The third question gives the expression (1 ◎ 3) + (X ◎ 2) = −8 + 14i and asks to find X. Solving this equation:\n-14i = 2(X - 7i)i\n-14i = -2 Xi - 14\nso X = [[2]]\n\n4. Following the previously defined rules, we interpret the final expression (4 ◎ 5) + (2 ◎ 3) as follows:\n- 4 ◎ 5 = 4 * 5 = 20\n- 2 ◎ 3 = 2 * 3i = 6i\n\nSo, their sum is 20 + 6i. \n\nThus the final answer is [[20 + 6i]]."}

For instance, f △ g could be the product rule in Leibniz notation or a similar notation indicating the derivative. The product rule states that if u(x) and v(x) are two differentiable functions, the derivative of their product is given by:\n\nduv(x) = ud(x)*v(x) + u(x)*vd(x) \n\nWhere:\n- duv(x) is the derivative of the product u(x) and v(x)\n- u(x) and v(x) are the given functions\n- ud(x) and vd(x) are their respective derivatives\n\nLet's apply this rule to the provided examples.\n---\n\n### Example 1:\nf(x)=ln(x), g(x)=x^3\nf △ g = [d(ln(x))*g(x) + f(x)*dg(x)]\n= [(1/x) * x^3 + ln(x) * 3x^2] \n= [x^2(3 + ln(x))]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n≈ 3x^2 for large x\n≈ a linear function of ln(x) for small x\n\nSo, the expression is [[3x^2]] when x is large, and an approximate linear function when x is small.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2:\nf(x)=x^2, g(x)=ln(x)\nf △ g = [d(x^2)*g(x) + f(x)*dg(x)]\n= [2x * ln(x) + x^2 * 1/x] \n= [[2x * ln(x) + x]]\n\nHere, we don't seem to arrive at your provided answer. Could you clarify the nature of g(x)?\n\n---\n\n### Example 3:\nf(x)=e^x, g(x)=sqrt(x)\nf △ g = [d(e^x)*g(x) + f(x)*dg(x)]\n= [e^x * sqrt(x) + e^x * 1/2sqrt(x)] \n= [[e^x * sqrt(x) (1 + 1/2)]]\n= [[e^x * sqrt(2)/2]]\n\nThe derivative at x = 1 is approximately [[e/sqrt(2)]]. Here, I'm unable to reproduce your result. Could you verify the definition of Δ and f and g?\n\n---\n\n### Example 4:\nf(x)=\\sqrt{x}, g(x)=\\cos(x)\nf △ g = [d(\\sqrt{x})*g(x) + f(x)*dg(x)]\n= [1/2sqrt(x) * cos(x) + sqrt(x) * -sin(x)] \n= [[-sqrt(x)sin(x) + (1/2)cos(x)/sqrt(x)]]"}

The chain rule in calculus is a formula used to find the derivative of a composite function.\n\nThe chain rule tells us that if we have two functions f(x) and g(x), then the derivative of their composition (f(g(x))) is given by the formula:\n\n\\text{{d}{{f(g(x))}} \\over {\\text{d}x}} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)\n\nWhere:\n- f(g(x)) is the composite function.\n- f'(g(x)) is the derivative of f evaluated at g(x).\n- g'(x) is the derivative of g with respect to x.\n\nLet's apply this to solve the previous questions.\n\n**For f(x) = lnx and g(x) = x^3:**\n\nf'(x) = 1/x (derivative of natural logarithm)\ng'(x) = 3x^2 (derivative of x^3)\n\nNow, applying the chain rule:\n\nf'(g(x)) = 1/g(x)\ng'(x) = 3x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of f(g(x)) = (1/g(x)) * 3x^2 = 3x^2/g(x)\n\nPlugging in g(x) = x^3, we get:\n\nf'(g(x)) = 3x^2/x^3 = \\frac{3x^2}{x^3} = \\frac{3}{x}\n\nTherefore, the derivative of f composed with g is:\n[[3/x]]\n\n**For f(x) = e^x and g(x) = sin(x):**\n\nf'(x) = e^x (derivative of the exponential function)\ng'(x) = cos(x) (derivative of sine)\n\nAt x = 0:\n\nf(g(0)) = e^{\\sin(0)} = e^0 = 1\nf'(g(0)) \\cdot g'(0) = e^{\\sin(0)} \\cdot \\cos(0) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n\nSo, the value of the derivative of f composed with g at x = 0 is:\n[[1]]\n\n**For f(x) = sin(x) and g(x) = x:**\n\nf'(x) = cos(x) (derivative of sine)\ng'(x) = 1 (derivative of x)\n\nAt x = π/4:\n\nf(g(π/4)) = sin(π/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\nf'(g(π/4)) \\cdot g'(π/4) = cos(\\pi/4) \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{2}/2 \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{2}/2\n\nSo, the value is:\n[[\\sqrt{2}/2]]\n\n**For f(x) = cos(x) and g(x) = x^3:**\n\nf'(x) = -\\sin(x) (derivative of cosine)\ng'(x) = 3x^2 (derivative of x^3)\n\nUsing the chain rule:\n\nf'(g(x)) = -\\sin(g(x))\ng'(x) = 3x^2\n\nSo, the derivative of the composition is:\n\n-sin(x^3) * 3x^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n[[-3x^2 * sin(x^3)]]\n\nSo, the derivative of f composed with g is [-3x^2 * sin(x^3)]."}

Each question asks for the value of the composite function at a specific point or over the entire domain.\n\nFor the first question, the composite function f □ g is found by substituting g(x) into f(x). So, we have:\nf(x) = ln(x), g(x) = x^3\nf(g(x)) = ln(x^3) = 3 ln(x)\nThe derivative of g(x) with respect to x is 3x^2. So, using the chain rule, the derivative of f(g(x)) is (1/x) * 3x^2 = 3 + 3x^2. Therefore, f □ g = [[\\frac{1}{x}+3x^2]].\n\nFor the second question, we are evaluating the composite function at a specific point:\nf(g(0)) = f(sin(0)) = e^(sin(0)) = e^0 = 2\nSo, the value of the composite function f □ g at x = 0 is [[2]].\n\nFor the third question, we are evaluating f(g(π/4)):\nf(g(π/4)) = sin(π/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\ng(π/4) = π/4\nNow, using the composite function rule, the value of f □ g at x = π/4 is f'(g(x)) * g'(x):\nf'(g(π/4)) = cos(g(π/4)) = cos(π/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\ng'(π/4) = 1\nSo, f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = (\\sqrt{2}/2) * 1 = \\sqrt{2}/2\nTherefore, the value of f □ g at x = π/4 is [[\\sqrt{2}/2+1]].\n\nFor the fourth question, we again find f(g(x)) by substituting g(x) into f(x):\nf(g(x)) = sin(ln(x))\nSince the composition goes in the direction of g -> f, the derivative of the composite function will be f'(g(x)) * g'(x). The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = 1/x. To find f'(g(x)), we need to differentiate f(x) = sin(x), which gives us f'(x) = cos(x). So, f'(g(x)) = cos(ln(x)).\n\nTherefore, f □ g = [[\\cos(\\ln x)\\times\\frac{1}{x}]]"}

The goal is to find the function that results from applying the input function $g(x)$ to $f(x)$.\n\nIn the first example, $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x^3$. To find $f ▽ g$, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\]\n\nand the derivative function of $f ▽ g$ is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx} x^6 = 6x^5 \\]\n\nThen, to get the final answer, we add the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n\\[ 6x^5 + \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = 6x^5 + 3x^2 = x^2 (6x^3 + 3) \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = x^2 (6x^3 + 3)$. This does not match the provided answer, which suggests there might be an error or a missing step in the provided solution.\n\nFor the second question, $f(x) = e^x$ and $g(x) = \\ln(x)$, and you are asked to find $f ▽ g$. Again, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = e^{\\ln(x)} \\]\n\nUsing the identity $e^{\\ln(x)} = x$, we get:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = x \\]\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(g(x))$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx} x = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we add the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$, which can also be written as $1 + \\frac{-1}{x}$ or $\\frac{x - 1}{x}$. This simplified form is different from the provided answer.\n\nIn the third example, you are asked to find the value of $f ▽ g$ when $x = 0$, where $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g(x) = x^4$. Substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = \\sin(x^4) \\]\n\nWhen $x = 0$, $g(0) = 0^4 = 0$, so:\n\n\\[ f(g(0)) = \\sin(0) = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $f ▽ g$ when $x = 0$ is indeed [[0]].\n\nFor the last question, you have $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g(x) = \\ln(x)$, and you are asked to find $f ▽ g$. Following the same steps as before, we substitute:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = \\sin(\\ln(x)) \\]\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(g(x))$ with respect to $x$, using the chain rule and the derivatives of sine and natural logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\cos(\\ln(x)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} \\]\n\nNow, adding the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x)) + 1}{x} \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x)) + 1}{x}$. In LaTeX, this can be written as:\n\n[[\\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x)) + 1}{x}]]"}

For the first question, $f(x, y) = 1$ is a constant function, and the area of the rectangular region $D$ is simply its length times width, resulting in $2 * 3 = 6$ square units. Since the function value is constant and equals 1, the integral is simply the area, which is 6, and then divide by 3 to get the final answer of 2.\n\n2. In the second question, $f(x, y) = xy$ is integrated over the same rectangular region $D$. The integral of $xy$ over this region can be calculated by integrating with respect to $x$ first, treating $y$ as a constant, and then integrating the resulting function of $y$ over the specified range. This results in $\\int_{1}^{2}\\int_{1}^{3} xy \\, dx \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{1}{2}xy^2 \\Big|_1^2 \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} (2y^2 - \\frac{1}{2}y^2) \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{3}{2}y^2 \\, dy = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}y^3 |_1^3 = 6$.\n\n3. The third question involves integrating $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ over the same domain $D$. This can be done by first integrating with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a constant: $\\int_{1}^{2} x^2 + y^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + y^2x \\Big|_1^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(8 - 1) + (4 - 1)y^2 = \\frac{7}{3} + 3y^2$. Then, we integrate the resulting function with respect to $y$ over the range $[1, 3]$: $\\int_{1}^{3} (\\frac{7}{3} + 3y^2) \\, dy = \\frac{7}{3}y + y^3 |_1^3 = \\frac{7}{3}(3 - 1) + (27 - 1) = \\frac{7}{3} \\times 2 + 26 = \\frac{40}{3}$.\n\n4. For the last question, $f(x, y) = xy$ is integrated over the domain $D: 1 \\leq x \\leq 2, 0 \\leq y \\leq 1$. Integrating with respect to $x$ first, treating $y$ as a constant: $\\int_{1}^{2} xy \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2}x^2y |_1^2 = (2 - \\frac{1}{2})y = \\frac{3}{2}y$. Then, integrating this function with respect to $y$ over the range $[0, 1]$: $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{3}{2}y \\, dy = \\frac{3}{4}y^2 |_0^1 = \\frac{3}{4}(1) = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nSo, the answer to the last question is [[3/4]]."}

For each question, the function is integrated over the defined region, and the final answer is the volume of this region.\n\nTo compute the volume of integration for each question, we first need to extract the function and the domain.

The rule is to compute the definite integral of the given function across the given domain.\n\nIn the third question, the function provided is a polynomial function, so the double integration can be solved by integrating term by term.\n\nIn the last question, the function is an exponential function. For evaluating the double integral of an exponential function, we can apply the property of integrating in any order, meaning that it does not matter whether we integrate over x first and then y or vice versa. This allows us to perform the integration one variable at a time, which is often simpler.\n\nHere's how we can solve the last prompt's double integral step by step:\n1. Integration over x: The integral of the exponential function $e^{x + y}$ with respect to x from 0 to 1 is $e^{x + y}|_{x=0}^{x=1} = e^{1 + y} - e^y$.\n\n2. Integration over y: Now, we integrate the result from step 1 with respect to y from 0 to 2. This gives us the double integral:\n$\\int_{0}^{2} (e^{1 + y} - e^y) dy = [e^{1 + y} - e^y]|_{y=0}^{y=2} = e^3 + e^2 - e^2 - 1 = e^3 - 1$.\n\nSo, the answer is the numerical representation of $e^3 - 1$, which is: \n[[4.48168899]]"}

In general, for two matrices A and B, the matrix product  $A \\otimes B$ is defined if the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B, and results in a matrix with the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given matrices:\n1. For the first question:\n   - $A = \\begin {pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin {pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - To calculate the matrix product $A \\otimes B$, we multiply corresponding row elements from A with column elements from B and sum them:\n     - $A_{1,1} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 1 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3 = 17$\n     - $A_{1,2} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 1 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 4 = 22$\n     - $A_{2,1} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 3 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 3 = 15$\n     - $A_{2,2} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 3 \\times 6 + 4 \\times 4 = 20$\n   - So, the result is $A \\otimes B = \\begin {pmatrix} 17 & 22 \\\\ 15 & 20 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - In the given format, the answer is: [[((17, 22), (15, 20))]]\n\n2. For the second question:\n   - $A = \\begin {pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin {pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Calculating $A \\otimes B$:\n     - $A_{1,1} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 0 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 3 = 6$\n     - $A_{1,2} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 0 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 5 = 13$\n     - $A_{2,1} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 2 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 3 = 4$\n     - $A_{2,2} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 2 \\times 3 + 0 \\times 5 = 6$\n   - The product is $A \\otimes B = \\begin {pmatrix} 6 & 13 \\\\ 4 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - In the specified format: [[((6, 13), (4, 6))]]\n\n3. For the third question:\n   - $A = \\begin {pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ -3 & -4 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin {pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Calculating the matrix product:\n     - $A_{1,1} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 1 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 3 = 5$\n     - $A_{1,2} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 1 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 4 = 10$\n     - $A_{2,1} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = -3 \\times 1 + (-4) \\times 3 = -3 - 12 = -15$\n     - But, $-3 \\times 1 + (-4) \\times 3 = -3 - 12 = -15$\n     - $A_{2,2} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = -3 \\times 2 + (-4) \\times 4 = -6 - 16 = -22$\n   - So, $A \\otimes B = \\begin {pmatrix} 5 & 10 \\\\ -15 & -22 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - In the given format: [[((5, 10), (-15, -22))]]\n\n4. For the fourth question:\n   - $A = \\begin {pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin {pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Here, the number of columns in A is equal to the number of rows in B, so the matrix product is defined:\n     - $A_{1,1} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 2 = 2$\n     - $A_{1,2} = (A_{1,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{1,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 2 = 2$\n     - $A_{2,1} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,1}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,1}) = 0 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n     - $A_{2,2} = (A_{2,1} \\times B_{1,2}) + (A_{2,2} \\times B_{2,2}) = 0 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 2 = 2$\n   - The matrix product is $A \\otimes B = \\begin {pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Formatting the answer: [[((2, 2), (2, 2))]]\n\nSo, for the fourth question, the answer is: [[((2, 2), (2, 2))]]."}
