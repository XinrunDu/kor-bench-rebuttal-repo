(2 raised to the power of X) = 4 (since 5^4 = 625)\n3. X = 2 (since 2 raised to the power of 2 is 4)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[2]]"}

Find C.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[4]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 25※5※14.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Okay, let's try to find the rules based on the given questions and answers.\n\nFrom the first question, we can see that 5 ※ 25 = 7. This suggests that the operation ※ is not a standard arithmetic operation.\n\nFrom the second question, we can see that if X ※ 9 = 5, then X can be either 3 or 27. This means that the operation ※ is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping.\n\nFrom the third question, we can see that the rule for the operation ※ is as follows:\n- If a is a multiple of b, then a ※ b = a / b + C\n- If b is a multiple of a, then a ※ b = b / a + C\n- If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, then a ※ b = 24\n- C is a parameter that is determined to be 4 in this case\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n25 ※ 5 ※ 14\n- 25 is a multiple of 5, so 25 ※ 5 = 25 / 5 + 4 = 9\n- 9 is not a multiple of 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 9, so 9 ※ 14 = 24\n- Therefore, 25 ※ 5 ※ 14 = 9 ※ 14 = 24\n\nThe answer is [[24]]."}

To do this, we need to first compute the value of \"4♀3\", which is the result of the \"♀\" operation. We know that \"4♀3=3.5\", so we can infer that the \"♀\" operation is some kind of operation that takes two operands and produces a result that is the average of the two operands plus a constant (in this case, 3.5).\n\nNext, we need to compute the value of \"2♂(4♀3)\". We know that the \"♂\" operation is some kind of operation that takes two operands and produces a result that is the first operand multiplied by 4 plus the second operand. So, we can compute the value of \"2♂(4♀3)\" as follows:\n\n\"4♀3\" = (4 + 3) / 2 + 3.5 = 7.5\n\"2♂(4♀3)\" = 2 × 4 + 7.5 = 15.5\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question is [[15/2]]."}

This suggests that the operation \"※\" is not a standard arithmetic operation.\n\nFrom the second question, we can see that if X ※ 9 = 5, then X can be either 3 or 27. This means that the operation \"※\" is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping.\n\nFrom the third question, we can see that the rule for the operation \"※\" is as follows:\n- If a is a multiple of b, then a ※ b = a / b + C\n- If b is a multiple of a, then a ※ b = b / a + C\n- If a is not a multiple of b, and b is not a multiple of a, then a ※ b = 24, where C is a constant.\n\nGiven that 10 ※ 2 = 9, we can calculate the value of C as follows:\n- 10 is not a multiple of 2, and 2 is not a multiple of 10, so we use the third rule: 10 ※ 2 = 24\n- 24 = 9, so C = 15.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n- 19 ※ 28 = 28 / 19 + 15 = 1 + 15 = 16\n- 16 ※ 31 = 31 / 16 + 15 = 1 + 15 = 16\n- 286 is a multiple of 13, so 286 ※ 13 = 286 / 13 + 15 = 22 + 15 = 37\n- 19 ※ 16 ※ 37 = 37 / (16 * 19) + 15 = 1 + 15 = 16\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question is [[16]]."}

For example, X ≥ 5 or X ≤ 10.\nUse only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\". No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the provided questions and answers, I can observe the following rules:\n\n1. The operation \"&\" represents the bitwise AND operation.\n2. The operation \"$\" represents an unknown operation, which is not explicitly defined.\n3. The values used in the expressions are integers.\n4. The answer to the first question is the sum of the results of the two operations: (7&4) and (5$8).\n5. The answer to the second question is the product of the results of the two operations: (12$7) and (4&9).\n6. The answer to the third question is an inequality that represents the possible values of X, given the equation x&9=10.\n7. The answer to the fourth question is an inequality that represents the possible values of X, given the equation (X § 3) - (1 $ 4) = 2.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nIf (X § 5) + (3 $ 2) = 7, find X.\nThe answer should be in the form of an inequality. For example, X ≥ 5 or X ≤ 10.\nUse only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\". No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nTo solve this, we need to rearrange the equation (X § 5) + (3 $ 2) = 7 to find the possible values of X.\n\nSubtracting (3 $ 2) from both sides, we get:\n(X § 5) = 7 - (3 $ 2)\n\nSince the operation \"$\" is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of (3 $ 2). However, we can infer that the result of this operation must be a constant value, let's call it \"k\".\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n(X § 5) = 7 - k\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\nX § 5 = 7 - k\nX = (7 - k) § 5\n\nSince the operation \"§\" is also unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of X. However, we can infer that the result of this operation must be a constant value, which means that the possible values of X are bounded by an inequality.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be in the form of an inequality, using only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\".\n\nBased on the pattern observed in the previous questions, the answer to this question is:\n\n[[X ≥ (7 - k) / 5]]"}

The operation \"&\" represents the bitwise AND operation.\n2. The operation \"$\" represents an unknown operation, but it seems to be some kind of arithmetic operation.\n\nNow, let's look at the rules:\n\n1. For the first question, (7&4) + (5$8) = 12. This means that the unknown operation \"$\" is some kind of arithmetic operation that, when combined with the bitwise AND operation, produces the result 12.\n\n2. For the second question, (12$7)×(4&9) = 48. This means that the unknown operation \"$\" is still the same as the previous question, and the bitwise AND operation is used to compute the second part of the expression.\n\n3. For the third question, if x&9=10, then x≥10. This means that the bitwise AND operation with 9 results in 10, which implies that x must be greater than or equal to 10.\n\nNow, we can apply these rules to solve the last question:\n\n(X § 4) + (3 $ 2) = 10\n\nWe know that the unknown operation \"$\" is the same as in the previous questions. We also know that the bitwise AND operation with 4 results in some value that, when combined with the unknown operation, produces 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question is:\n\n[[X≥6]]\n\nThis is because if X § 4 = 6 (since 6 + 3 $ 2 = 10), then X must be greater than or equal to 6."}

The operation \"&\" is the bitwise AND operation.\n2. The operation \"$\" is a custom operation that we need to determine.\n3. The operation \"§\" is another custom operation that we need to determine.\n\nTo determine the custom operations, let's try to find the patterns in the given answers:\n\n1. (7&4) + (5$8) = 12\n   This suggests that (5$8) = 5.\n2. (12$7)×(4&9) = 48\n   This suggests that (12$7) = 4.\n3. x&9 = 10\n   This suggests that x = 14.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n\nCompute (9$6)+(4§4).\n1. (9$6) = 9 (based on the pattern of the first question)\n2. (4§4) = 4 (based on the pattern of the third question)\n3.
