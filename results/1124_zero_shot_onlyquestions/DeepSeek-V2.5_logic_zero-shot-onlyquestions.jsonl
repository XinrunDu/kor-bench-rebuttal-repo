It does not use other connectives like implication (\\(\\rightarrow\\)) or equivalence (\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form is a formula where every propositional variable appears an even number of times. This means that if a variable \\(p\\) appears in the formula, it must appear 2, 4, 6, etc., times.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's reason through the problem:\n\n- A formula with 4 propositional variables (let's call them \\(p, q, r, s\\)) can be constructed using only the basic connectives AND, OR, and NOT.\n- For the formula to be an all-even form, each of the 4 variables must appear an even number of times. The simplest way to ensure this is to have each variable appear exactly twice (since 2 is the smallest even number greater than 0).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations:\n- We can pair each variable with itself (e.g., \\(p \\land p\\), \\(q \\land q\\), etc.), which satisfies the all-even condition.\n- Alternatively, we can pair different variables (e.g., \\(p \\land q\\), \\(r \\land s\\)), but this might complicate the formula structure.\n\nHowever, the simplest method is to pair each variable with itself. This ensures that each variable appears exactly twice, satisfying the all-even condition.\n\nGiven this, the simplest basic form that meets the all-even condition for each variable is:\n\\[ (p \\land p) \\land (q \\land q) \\land (r \\land r) \\land (s \\land s) \\]\n\nThis formula is a basic form because it uses only the AND and NOT connectives, and it is an all-even form because each variable appears exactly twice.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly **one** formula that satisfies both conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"}

This structure suggests that we are dealing with a logical operation, likely in the context of propositional logic or Boolean algebra.\n\nGiven the format of the problem, we can infer that the parentheses likely represent logic operators or functions that operate on the inputs \"O\" and \"A\" to produce the output \"SOP\".\n\nLet's analyze the structure:\n1. The first set of inputs is \"()O()\" which should be transformed into \"S\".\n2.

For \"()O()\":\n   - If we use \"∧\" and assume the missing inputs are \"S\" and \"O\", we get \"S ∧ O\" which could simplify to \"S\" under certain conditions (since \"S\" might be true when \"O\" is true).\n2.

The derived statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" is a more general assertion that captures the same idea but with less specificity (\"in the past\" vs. \"at some time in the past\").\n\nThis type of inference is a form of generalization, where a specific statement is made more general without losing its essential meaning. The logical structure here involves taking a specific temporal property (\"in the past\") and reducing it to a more general one (\"at some time in the past\"), while retaining the core assertion about Dr. Lee's activities.\n\nThe inference formula that corresponds to this process is typically captured by a form of logical generalization or existential quantification. Specifically, it might be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\exists t \\in \\text{Past} : \\text{Dr Lee worked on farms at time } t \\]\n\nThis formula asserts that there exists some time \\( t \\) in the past such that Dr. Lee worked on farms at that time. This matches the derived statement's meaning.\n\nTherefore, the inference formula that corresponds to the given statement and its derivation is:\n\n[[1]] Generalization or existential quantification.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified logical explanation, and the exact structure of the inference formula might vary depending on the specific logical system or framework being used."}

The rule states that the estimated proportion \\( \\hat{p} \\) of the population who would get an A is the same as the sample proportion unless the sample is unrepresentative.\n\nGiven that the sample is very small (10 students out of 50), it is plausible to assume that the sample might not be fully representative. However, since all students in the sample got an A, it is reasonable to estimate that a significant proportion of the class would also get an A.\n\n3. **Estimate the proportion**: Since the sample proportion is 1.0 (or 100%), it is unlikely that the entire class would get an A, especially with a larger class size. A more conservative estimate might be around 80-90% based on the assumption that the sample might not fully represent the class.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable estimate for the proportion of the whole class that would get an A is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{85\\%}\n\\]"}

Therefore, the observed proportion (p) is:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the P-Generalization rule**: The P-Generalization rule states that if a proportion p is observed in a sample, it can be generalized to the population with a confidence interval. Given that the sample size is small (5 days), we use the binomial distribution to estimate the proportion.\n\n3. **Estimate the population proportion**: Since we are asked to provide a point estimate (in percentage format), we can directly use the observed proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Estimated proportion} = p \\times 100\\% = 0.8 \\times 100\\% = 80\\%\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated proportion of days in which the average AQI of the city was below 50 is [[80%]]."}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant who is good at reasoning.
