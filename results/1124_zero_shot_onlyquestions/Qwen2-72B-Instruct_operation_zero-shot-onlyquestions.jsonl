Let's start by simplifying the equation:\n\n(6 $ X) + (9 § 2) = 15\n\nWe don't know the operations $ and §, but since we need to find X and it only appears in the expression (6 $ X), we can deduce that the second expression (9 § 2) should somehow allow us to solve for X. Let's assume that (9 § 2) results in a value that we can subtract from 15 to isolate the term with X.\n\nLet (9 § 2) = Y. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(6 $ X) + Y = 15\n\nSubtracting Y from both sides:\n\n(6 $ X) = 15 - Y\n\nWe are told that the answer should be in the form of an inequality. This means we will need to make assumptions based on the information given. Since we don't have the definitions for $ and §, we can only surmise that for some given Y that lies between (9 § 2)'s value and 15, (6 $ X) must be equal to 15 - Y.\n\nTo find X in the form of an inequality, we need a relationship between X and Y. However, without definitive operations, we cannot derive a concrete X value. But, knowing that (6 $ X) should equal a value between 0 and 15 if Y is positive, we can propose:\n\nX is determined by the inverse of $ operation applied to (15 - Y)/6\n\nNot knowing the exact operation, we assume Y ≥ 0, for the maximum value of X (when Y is subtracted from 15 is at its minimum). This yields:\n\n[[X ≥ (15/6)]] when considering no operation. Note that the proposal is primarily a concept within the given constraints and doesn't resolve without clarity on the intended operations $ and §.

However, this is a non-standard interpretation which does not align with how standard operations work. Here, it seems like the intended meaning is to express a different kind of operation implied by \"3\", the format suggests it might be applying some operation with 3, but as there is no clear convention, guesses would be needed for its meaning. In arithmetical puzzle contexts, such operations might mean in-part a slice operation, truncation, or multiplication by 3, but since these are undefined with these symbols, the answer cannot be definitively arrived upon.\n\nGoing on the (potentially invalid) interpretation, the factorial-like understanding for ♂ with 3 suggests applying a descent operation 3 times, akin to multiplying by 3, or applying some operation with 3. As none of these interpretations are standard and the problem setup does not give additional clues, considering it a simple multiplication is a pragmatic interpretation.

Without explicit rules for ① and ②, a general answer can't be provided. However, if we make some assumptions based on the positioning of the numbers and symbols, we might interpret them as follows:\n\nIf ① represents an operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and ② another operation or a specific mathematical function, the notation could be asking us to perform some calculation using these specific rules. However, no standard rules are associated with this notation, and the context does not provide any hints. Given the lack of information, we must default to a literal interpretation. If we treat ① and ② simply as placeholders for operations (and not knowing what they are, we can't apply any), the expression can be left as it is, or interpreted as an unknown operation between 49 and the result of another unknown operation between 9 and 2.\n\nGiven the impossibility of a definite calculation, the answer must reflect the indeterminacy. Therefore, we report this as an [[indeterminate]] result within the structure given. However, considering the instruction for a numeric answer and the impossibility of finding one from provided information, the instruction cannot be followed accurately.\n\nIf the aim is to just replace the placeholders with a standard operation and get a single number (which would require making an assumption about the operation), we could say:\n\n1. If ① were \"+\" (addition) and ② \"*\" (multiplication), the result would be 49 + (9 * 2).\n2. If ① were \"*\" (multiplication) and ② \"+\" (addition), the result would be 49 * (9 + 2).\n3. Etc.\n\nHowever, since we don't know which operation ① and ② represent, an answer can't be provided. To meet the instruction for a numerical response boxed in double square brackets, one must arbitrarily select operations for placeholders ① and ② and calculate accordingly.\n\nA placeholder interpretation leading to a numerical value, based on guesswork, might look like this:\n\nIf we guess that ① is addition and ② is multiplication:\nResult = 49 + (9 * 2) = 49 + 18 = 67.\n\nBut again, without clear rules, this is merely a guess.\n\nThereby, indicating an \"unknown\" or indeterminate answer is the closest to the formal requirement for an answer, which is [[indeterminate]]."}

Given 5◇2◇X=625, and keeping in mind the format, a reasonable operation that fits is exponentiation. It is common to see an exponential relationship denoted with symbols, especially in puzzles or unconventional math notations. Therefore, 5 raised to the power of 2, and then this result is raised to the power of X (or vice versa) could equal 625.\n\nLet's solve it by interpreting the double symbol \"◇\" as an operation, and in this context, exponentiation makes sense. Assume the numbers are exponentiated in order (5^2)^X = 625.\n\nFirst, solve the exponent 5^2, which is 25. So, we have 25^X = 625.\n\nNow, 625 is 25^2. Therefore, X must be 2.\n\nSo the answer is: [[2]]"}

Since the operation is not standard, we assume it's a custom or context-specific operation. Assuming \"￠\" represents an operation similar to division or modulo, we can reverse the operation to find X. However, without exact specifics of how \"￠\" operates, we must infer or assume.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted as X \"￠\" 256 equals 73/24. If \"￠\" operates similarly to division, we can consider the equation as X / 256 = 73/24. To find X, we reverse the operation by multiplying both sides by 256 to isolate X.\n\nThus, X = (73/24) * 256\n\nNext, simplify the multiplication:\n\nX = 73 * (256/24)\nX = 73 * (32/3)\nX = 73 * 32 / 3\nX = 2336/3\nX = 778.6666666667 (approximately)\n\nHowever, the instructions specify to only give the answer as a number, and the context and legibility of the given equation is partially grounded in an assumption of the interpretation of \"￠\", which is not clarified.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in interpreting \"￠\" as a division operation, and to strictly adhere to the given instruction to provide the answer as a number, the answer is:\n\n[[779]] (rounded to the nearest whole number for simplification as per instruction)\n\nThis is provided under the logic for reversing an assumed division operation to solve an equation for the value of X, adhering to the instruction of providing the answer only as a number."}

The expression given is:\n\n3￠3￠X = 5/2\n\nLet's consider the possible operations and solve for X accordingly.\n\nFor this to be a division, 3 divided by 3 is 1, and 1 divided by X can't give us 5/2 if X is a real number. So, this likely isn't division.\n\nFor this to be addition, 3 + 3 is 6. The equation then becomes 6 + X = 5/2, which clearly does not work, since 6 is already greater than 5/2.\n\nFor this to be subtraction, 3 - 3 is 0, and 0 - X can't equal 5/2 if X is a real number (this would make X a negative number, which would not add to our equation to become positive 5/2).\n\nSo we consider it to be multiplication. In this case, 3 * 3 gives us 9. The equation then becomes 9 * X = 5/2. To solve for X, we simply divide 5/2 by 9.\n\nLet's do that calculation:\n\nX = (5/2) / 9\nX = 5 / (2 * 9)\nX = 5 / 18\n\nThe answer is [[5/18]]."}

This may not be correct without the context, but let's proceed with this speculation to see where the math takes us.\n\nAssuming the operation is multiplication, we substitute $X$ and get:\n\\[ 6 \\times 3 + 2(X \\times 2) = 37 + 60i. \\]\n\\[ 18 + 4X = 37 + 60i. \\]\n\nSolving for $X$, we get:\n\\[ 4X = 37 + 60i - 18. \\]\n\\[ 4X = 19 + 60i. \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4 yields:\n\\[ X = (19 + 60i)/4. \\]\n\\[ X = 4.75 + 15i. \\]\n\nThus, the solution is a complex number, $4.75 + 15i$, but since the question asks for X to be given as a number, and under our interpretation of \"◎\" aligning with basic operations, the answer is not straightforward in terms of extracting a conventional scalar numerical value for X.\n\nHowever, adhering to the instruction to provide only a number as the answer within double square brackets, and interpreting the question as considering X as a real number followed by \"i\", we would separate $4.75$ as the real part and consider $15$ as the imaginary part. Rules sometimes require tailoring answers to fit within given constraints. Yet, understanding that the original problem as posed aims for a more extended response accommodating complex solutions, we interpret the query's structure specifically requesting a real number output. Therefore, recognizing this as a potentially limiting constraint under this assumption, we provide the real component as the answer:\n\n[[4.75]]\n\nIt should be noted that under a more inclusive interpretation considering the full solution within complex analysis, the response incorporating the imaginary part should be acknowledged, particularly in mathematical contexts adhering to complex number principles. However, directly addressing the instruction for a numerical-only value, we confine the solution to the real part as indicated."}

However, since set A contains all natural numbers, and set B is not well-defined (as \"positive\" could be considered synonymous with natural numbers, but could also imply real numbers), the typical interpretation is that B also contains all positive natural numbers. In this context, the Cartesian product would consist of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is a natural number from A and the second element is a positive number from B, which here we will also consider as natural numbers.\n\nGiven that both sets are infinite and contain the same elements (natural numbers), the Cartesian product A×B would contain an infinite number of ordered pairs, each pair (a, b) such that a ∈ A and b ∈ B, where both a and b are natural numbers.\n\nHowever, it's not practical and certainly not possible to list all the elements in such an infinite set. Therefore, the answer is that it is an infinite set of ordered pairs consisting of all combinations of natural numbers as follows:\n\n[[{(a, b) ∣ a ∈ ℕ, b ∈ ℕ}]]\n\nThis answer clarifies that the set contains all ordered pairs where both the first and the second element are in the set of natural numbers."}

If a represents a multiplication factor for division (i.e., a fraction resulting in 8 when dividing by 3), it does not provide a clear single integer solution.\n\nGiven the options (which do not include decimals or fractions), let's consider the literal instruction and assume possible interpretations are explicitly under integer results or where negative values are feasible within the context.

Here, '★' is not a standard mathematical operation, but based on the context, it likely represents an operation that involves the function f(x) = x^3. We can infer that 'a★1' represents applying the function to 'a' in some way with '1' used in the operation. Given that f(x) = x^3, the most direct interpretation would be for 'a★1' to represent f(a * 1) = (a * 1)^3.\n\nHence, 'a★1' can be considered as (a*1)^3, and we know that should equal 6.
