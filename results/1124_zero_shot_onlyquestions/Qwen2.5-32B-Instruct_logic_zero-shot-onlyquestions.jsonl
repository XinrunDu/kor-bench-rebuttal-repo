The implication p>q is equivalent to !p|q (the contrapositive form). So, p>(p|q) is equivalent to !p|(p|q). Since (p|q) is True whenever p or q is True, it follows that !p|(p|q) is always True because if p is False, !p is True and the whole expression is True. If p is True, then (p|q) is True, so !p|(p|q) is True. Therefore, !(p>(p|q)) simplifies to !True, which is False. So, the entire expression !(p>(p|q))&r simplifies to False&r. Since False&r is False, the simplest result is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\text{False}; \\text{False}]} \\]\n\n### Expression (2): p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)\n\nThe original expression can be simplified by focusing on the inner expression first: ((p|q)&!p)>q. Looking at ((p|q)&!p):\n- (p|q)&!p is True only if both parts are True. However, if !p (the negation of p) is True, then p must be False, and thus (p|q) simplifies to (False|q), which just simplifies to q. Therefore, ((p|q)&!p) simplifies to (q&!p).\n- So, the expression ((p|q)&!p)>q simplifies to (q&!p)>q.

However, the right side (p>(q|r)) suggests that if p is true, then either q or r (or both) must be true.\n\nIn classical propositional logic, the left side ((p>q)&(p>r)) is equivalent to p>(q&r), not (p>(q|r)), because for both conditions to hold when p is true, q and r must both hold true. Hence, there's an inherent difference: one requires both q and r to be true if p is, whereas the other requires merely one of q or r to be true if p is. Thus, the equivalence in (1) is not valid according to the 16 Basic Equivalences.\n\nNext, look at the second equivalence:\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nThe symbol “=” often denotes biconditional (if and only if), and “!” indicates negation. So, !(p=q) would mean that p and q are not equivalent, i.e., either p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true.\n\nOn the right side is (p|q)&!(p&q). This means p or q is true, but not both, which indeed captures the essence of saying p and q are not equivalent. Therefore, this statement aligns with the concepts found in the 16 Basic Equivalences, marking this equivalence as valid.\n\nCombining both findings:\n\n- The first equivalence is invalid (B).\n- The second equivalence is valid (A).\n\nThus, the answer is [[B];[A]]."}

Associativity is a property that says the way in which you group elements when performing a computation does not change the result. For example, in arithmetic, both addition and multiplication are associative.\n\n1. If \"⇓\" represents a logical operation that is associative (like conjunction), then (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r) could be valid.\n2.

However, this would contradict the condition that only one of p, q, r can be true, because we can only have one true statement out of p, q, r.\n\nTherefore, Professor Wang is from Shanghai. Meaning q is true, p is false, and r is false. This means statements by each individual can be evaluated as follows:\n\n- Statement by Person A: \"!p&q\" is true (Professor Wang is indeed not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai, hence entirely correct).\n- Statement by Person B: \"p&!q\" is false (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, hence false).\n- Statement by Person C: \"!q&!r\" is false (Professor Wang is from Shanghai, contradicting the statement that Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou, hence entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to the rules given by Professor Wang, one got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong. However, our derived logical outcome simplifies the situation to one individual entirely correct and two entirely wrong according to the provided established logical conditions. But to align with the professor's statement about one getting half right, this points towards interpretation gaps where simplifying logic might need reevaluation contextually, but direct derived gives clear outcomes:\n\n[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [half right: None, based on direct interpretation]; [entirely incorrect: B/C]]. \n\nGiven the exact match, the final boxed answer fitting the given pattern would be:\n[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: None based on direct但她实际上是部分正确的，因为她的陈述是“不来自上海并且不来自杭州”，其中“不来自上海”的部分是错误的，但她指出了他不来自杭州的部分是正确的，符合有一半是对的条件。因此，调整回答定位：\n\n根据情况重新解析:\n- A完全正确：“他不是从苏州来的，他是从上海来的。”\n- C部分正确：“他既不是从上海来的，也不是从杭州来的。”正确的一半是他不是从杭州来的。\n- B完全错误：“他不是从上海来的，他是从苏州来的。”\n\n所以解答为：\n[[上海]; [完全正确: A]; [部分正确: C]; [完全错误: B]]."}

In other words, no matter what values (true or false) are assigned to the variables, the tautology evaluates to true.\n\n3. **Basic Form**: This term isn't standard in logic; however, in the context of this question, it might refer to a simple or canonical tautology. A simple or canonical tautology for propositional logic that uses all variables could be an expression that always evaluates to true regardless of the variables' truth assignments.\n\nGiven that formula A has 4 propositional variables and is a tautology, one simple tautology would be a disjunction that includes a variable and its negation, such as (p ∨ ¬p), for each variable. However, since the question asks for a basic form and A is supposed to include all four variables, a common basic form that is both a tautology and includes all four variables could be a disjunction of each variable and its negation. Thus, a form such as (p ∨ ¬p) ∧ (q ∨ ¬q) ∧ (r ∨ ¬r) ∧ (s ∨ ¬s) would serve as a simple and canonical tautology involving all 4 variables.\n\nHowever, because the question specifies \"basic form\" and a desired format, the answer might be looking for a single universal truth construct.

Based on the common terminology used in logic, we can define these terms:\n\n- **Basic form**: Often, a basic form might refer to a formula that includes each propositional variable exactly once. However, the term may vary in meaning depending on the context. For this answer, let's assume it means that the propositional variables can appear in any combination of negated and unnegated forms.\n\n- **All-even form**: This means that each propositional variable appears an even number of times within the formula. Given that we are talking about a formula that only contains the propositional variables in some form (negated or unnegated), achieving an all-even situation means having each variable pair up, or in the case of four variables, means each must appear either 0 or 2 times in some form (negated or unnegated).\n\nGiven that the formula contains 4 propositional variables, and must be an \"all-even form,\" we consider only configurations where each variable appears either not at all, or exactly twice. Since the logical connectives themselves don't concern this aspect of evenness, we focus on how these 4 variables can be paired up or not included at all.\n\nThe total number of such configurations can be calculated by determining the combinations in which each variable can be paired up. This is the same as figuring out how to partition 4 elements into sets of pairs, including the possibility of no elements being included.\n\nFor 4 variables (let’s name them A, B, C, D), we can have the following pair-ups (that's considering the variational independence):\n\n- All variables are paired: There’s only 1 such scenario, i.e., (AB)(CD).\n- Pairs can form for any pair of variables, with the others not appearing, leading to pairings like: (AB), (AC), (AD), (BC), (BD), and (CD). There’s a total of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) scenarios.\n- All variables do not have any pairings, i.e., they do not appear, leading to 1 scenario.\n\nAdding these, we get \\(1 + 6 + 1 = 8\\) scenarios where all variables either appear twice or not at all.\n\nThus, the number of such formulas is given by \\([[8]]\\)."}

In this context, \"dispel\" refers to the elimination of complementary literals (pairs of literals where one is the negation of the other) when clauses are combined.

Therefore, the result of dispel(C1, C2) in the provided format is:\n\n[[\"¬p\", \"¬q\", \"r\", \"¬q\", \"¬r\", \"s\", \"¬t\"]] \n\nHowever, this combines the literals without any reduction or simplification because no direct simplification can be done.

The resolution algorithm in logic is used to determine the satisfiability of a set of clauses. Before starting the algorithm, the expression is transformed into a set of clauses.

The target in resolution is to derive an empty clause (denoted as []), which signifies a contradiction and indicates that the original set of clauses is unsatisfiable.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with the initial clauses:\n    - ¬p ∨ q\n    - p ∨ q\n    - q\n\n2. Resolve ¬p ∨ q and p ∨ q.

However, this doesn't give us any new information since p is already in the original set.\n3. Next, we can try resolving (4) and (5) (¬r with r), which gives q.\n4. The new set of clauses now includes everything, plus q.\n5. Since q is already covered in (2) and (4), we don't get new information from this step.\n\nNeither of the new clauses p or q helps in generating new ones, as they are not in a form to reduce further with the other existing clauses. None of the combinations results in the empty clause which would mean contradiction.\n\nThus, the set of clauses is satisfiable since we can't derive the empty clause through resolution.\n\n[[satisfiable];[5]]"}

In traditional logic, there are four types of categorical propositions:\n- A (A-type proposition): \"All S are P\" (SAP)\n- E (E-type proposition): \"No S are P\" (SEP)\n- I (I-type proposition): \"Some S are P\" (SIP)\n- O (O-type proposition): \"Some S are not P\" (SOP)\n\nThe relationships between these propositions can be characterized by the following rules:\n1. If SAP (All S are P) is true, SOP (\"Some S are not P\") can be either true or false because SAP does not provide information about the existence or non-existence of elements in S that are not P.\n2. If SIP (\"Some S are P\") is true, SEP (\"No S are P\") must be false, because if some S are indeed P, it cannot be true that no S are P.\n3. If SIP (\"Some S are P\") is false, SEP (\"No S are P\") could be true because if it’s not true that some S are P, then it could be the case that no S are P at all. However, in traditional logic, a false SIP does not necessarily imply a true SEP due to the possibility that the category S could be completely empty, in which case neither SIP nor SOP would be true.\n4. If SOP (\"Some S are not P\") is false, SAP must be true, because if it’s not the case that some S are not P, then all S must be P.\n\nBased on these rules:\n- The first combination: SAP -> SOP is [false; either].\n- The second combination: SIP -> SEP is [true; false].\n- The third combination: SIP -> SEP is [false; could be true; but not definitively, as considerations about the emptiness of S need to be factored in].\n- The fourth combination: SOP -> SAP is [false; true].\n\nThus, the correct answers are:\n[[false; either]; [true; false]; [false; could be true]; [false; true]]\n\nHowever, in the format of true/false, and considering the strict logical relationships without considering the special case of an empty category S in the third case, we'll infer:\n- For the first and third inquiries, an absolute 'false' cannot be determined because of the nature of the SOP and SEP when SPECIFIC conditions aren’t met.\n- For a strict format answer:\n[[false; either]; [true; false]; [false; true]; [false; true]] Clearly, the third one has a caveat that wasn't fully addressed in strict true/false terms directly due to logical considerations beyond the basic true/false framework.\n\nFor direct true/false format (assuming non-empty S for SEP definitiveness):\n[[false; either]; [true; false]; [false; true]; [false; true]]"}

Here, we are focusing on the relationships between these propositions when one is known to be true and another false.\n\n1. If SIP (Some S are P) is false, this implies that no S can be P, making SIP and SOP mutually exclusive. Therefore, SOP (Some S are not P) would have to be true because if some S cannot be P, then some S must not be P. So, if SIP is false, SOP is [[true]].\n   \n2. If SOP (Some S are not P) is false, it means that all S must be P because there can't be any S that are not P. If all S are P, SIP (Some S are P) must be true (since if all are a part of P, some certainly are). So, if SOP is false, SIP is [[true]].\n   \n3. If SAP (All S are P) is true, then SEP (No S are P) must be false because if all S are P, then it cannot be true that no S are P - these statements contradict each other. So, if SAP is true, SEP is [[false]].\n   \n4. If SEP (No S are P) is true, then SAP (All S are P) must be false. The reasoning is similar to the previous one: if we assert \"no S are P\", we cannot simultaneously claim \"all S are P\". The two are contradicting each other.

All M are P (universally).\n2. There exists at least one M which is S.\n3. Therefore, there exists at least one S which is P.\n\nFor syllogisms, there are four figures and several moods which determine how the terms M (middle term), P (major term), and S (minor term) are positioned and quantified. The first step is to identify the placement of M, P, and S in the statements.\n\nSince we have that all M (middle term) are P (major term), the major premise is a universal affirmative statement. The second premise tells us about some relationship between M and S, implying a particular affirmative statement where at least one instance of M is also S. The conclusion then asserts an existential relationship between S (minor term) and P.\n\nThis structure tends to fit a particular mood where the major term P is the predicate of the conclusion, and the middle term M is the predicate of the major premise and the subject in the minor premise. Given our premises and conclusion, the arrangement of terms can be identified as follows:\n- M (middle) is all P (major, predicate).\n- Some M (middle) is S (minor, subject), leading to the conclusion some S (minor, subject) is P (major, predicate).\n\nThis aligns with the first figure of a syllogism (where the middle term is in the subject of the first premise and the predicate of the second premise, and the major and minor terms switch positions in the conclusion).\n\nFor the mood, we have:\n1. A (universal affirmative) major premise.\n2. I (particular affirmative) minor premise.\n\nGiven that the conclusion involves an existential assertion (some S is P), it suggests a valid mood in the first figure, such as AII.\n\nTherefore, the argument fits the format [[I];[AII]], denoting the first figure of the syllogism with the mood AII."}

The statements given don't form a classical syllogism directly, since they don't involve the standard major premise, minor premise, and conclusion structure where two terms are linked by a middle term.\n\nHowever, under the transformation into traditional syllogistic logic, we can infer what kind of logical structure would fit these statements:\n\n- Statement 1 ( ∀P⇒M ) can be understood as a universal affirmative (A) statement, but it doesn't act as connecting a major or minor term with a middle term in the syllogistic sense.\n- Statement 2 ( ∃S⇒¬M ) can be understood as an existential negative (O) statement about the existence of S in relation to M.\n- The inferred conclusion ( ∃S⇒¬P ) is an existential negative (O) statement regarding P.\n\nIn syllogistic logic, the traditional structure would not precisely fit the given form directly. If we consider the essence of the statements and look for the closest adaptation:\n- If we assume 'S' could act as a subject for the conclusion when considered through the prism of traditional syllogistic forms, this might lead us to consider a structure of first-figure, since the conclusion ∃S⇒¬P involves the subject 'S' and predicate 'P'.\n  \nHowever, fitting these into a precise traditional syllogistic structure may not yield an exact match due to the existential nature of the premises (because traditional syllogistic work often begins with universal statements unless augmented for particular cases) and since the inference drawn operates at the level of 'existence' rather than directly establishing a direct relation formed in the syllogism's rectilinear triad structure.

It leaves the possibility open that under certain conditions or circumstances, it might be possible. However, the statement \"A person cannot possibly pull their own hair and leave the earth\" means it is impossible for a person to accomplish this action under any conditions or circumstances, which is a stronger claim.\n\nIn modal logic, the first statement could be represented as \"¬□P\" (it is not necessary that P), while the second statement could be represented as \"¬◊P\" (it is not possible that P). The given inference attempts to move from a lack of necessity to a lack of possibility, which is not a valid inference in modal logic. Modal logic does not support an inference from \"¬□P\" to \"¬◊P\" directly without additional assumptions.\n\nThe options provided are not explicitly given, but based on the nature of the question asking for an association with modal logic operators, and considering common representations, '3' might correspond to an understanding that the inference from necessity to possibility is not direct in modal logic frameworks. Note that the precise mapping of options to modal logic principles was not provided in the question and assumed to fit the context of discussing the invalidity of the inference directly between necessity and possibility without further axioms or interpretations."}

The first pair:\n   - \"Citizens' rights must be protected.\"\n   - \"Not protecting citizens' rights is allowed.\"\n   \n   These statements are contradictory. The first sentence emphatically states that citizens' rights must be protected, which implies that not protecting them is not allowed. On the other hand, the second sentence suggests that it's acceptable not to protect citizens' rights. Clearly, these cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\n2. The second pair:\n   - \"Caring for the growth of the next generation is mandatory.\"\n   - \"Caring for the growth of the next generation is allowed.\"\n   \n   These two sentences are not directly contradictory. The first sentence suggests an obligation to care for the growth of the next generation. The second only states that caring for them is permitted. However, given that being \"mandatory\" implies being \"allowed,\" these sentences are consistent with each other. It's important to note that the second statement does not preclude the requirement stated in the first.\n\nHowever, the options provided (x Relation, * Relation, @ Relation, % Relation) seem to be placeholders for different types of logical relationships. Without the explicit meaning of each symbol, we cannot properly match the relationship. However, if we infer from common logic relations, the contradictory nature of the first pair and the consistency of the second could suggest contrasting and aligning relationships, respectively. Given the provided symbols, I'll choose B for the first pair, considering it as a contradiction, and C for the second pair as they are in alignment, assuming such interpretation fits the labels.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[C]]"}

However, based on the common understanding and context of the question, if Alice firmly believes that the sun rises in the east, then within the confines of her belief system, she does not doubt this fact. Thus, options A and C are incorrect because they imply either doubt or unawareness. Option B, however, incorrectly suggests that the truth of \"the sun rises in the east\" can be directly concluded from Alice's belief. The correct interpretation, given just Alice's firm belief, would not conclude anything about the truth of the belief itself but rather that she does not doubt it within her belief system. The phrasing of the question and options, particularly B, might be leading to an interpretation that goes beyond what solely belief entails.

In temporal logic, particularly in the context of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or Computational Tree Logic (CTL), expressing such a concept hinges on the idea that both commands, c1 and c2, do not alter the truth value of φ. However, since the question does not specify a particular logic system and requests the answer in a very specific format using [] for \"Globally\" or always in temporal logic sense, we assume the necessity operator [] encapsulates the notion of \"always\" under all circumstances, and the question imposes that the truth value of φ remains unaffected by c1 or c2.\n\nGiven neither c1 nor c2 affects φ, we assess the truth value of φ independently of the actions of c1 and c2. Thus, the logical expression focusing on φ's truth value under the conditions set by c1 and c2 being irrelevant to φ is simply expressed as the necessity of φ itself, indicating that φ holds across all scenarios, irrespective of c1 or c2:\n\n[[]]\n\nThe expression utilizes the [] operator to denote that φ holds globally or always, and in the most simplified form, representing the condition where φ's truth value is preserved regardless of c1 and c2, it simplifies to the expression itself under the context implied by the question.

This makes it impossible to select any of the provided options based on the factual, common understanding of methodological derivations of causality.\n\nTherefore, if we are strictly sticking to answering with the given options, and there's no direct term that matches \"experimental method\" or any other explicit causal determination method described in these symbols, then the provided options do not contain a correct label from a standard nomenclature perspective.\n\nIf the question is hypothetical and the goal is to match \"the experimental method\" to the closest symbol without known meaning, then the answer would theoretically be symbolic without specific agreement.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n[[A/B/C/D/E]] format requires selection.\n\nSince the characters provided (A through E) are symbols without explicit defined meanings in the context, and assuming one must select, a guess amongst equal non-descriptive options would be: [[A]]\n\nBut it is important to note that from a methodological standpoint (hence a critical perspective), there's no correct match between standard causal derivation methodology terminologies and the provided options."}

Since these symbols don't typically represent recognized correlation or causal inference methods in research, and assuming this might be a creatively abstract representation of methodological types, we will apply reasoning to common methodologies used in determining causality within health and exercise science studies.\n\nA conclusion that regular physical activity results in increased lung capacity is often derived through a comparative analysis. This involves comparing two groups under study: a group that regularly participates in physical activity and a group that does not, under controlled conditions to isolate and analyze the effect of physical activity.\n\nIn a research context, methods commonly used to establish causality include experimental design (where variables are manipulated to determine their effect), and observational studies (where pre-existing conditions are compared without direct manipulation). The scenario described aligns most closely with observational studies, as it compares existing groups.\n\nHowever, without clear definitions provided for each of the symbols in the choices given, it's impossible to match them to named methodologies accurately. Typically, an approach that would fit the described reasoning, if it were to be named with more common terms, would be an Observational Study or a Cross-Sectional Study methodology.\n\nGiven the abstract nature of the options provided with symbols, if we assume one of these options symbolizes an observational or cross-sectional methodology, the most reasonable selection from the given choices would be to pick one, based on context, which could theoretically be labeled as a method that entails comparative analysis of normal populations without direct experimentation, though this is speculative given the abstract nature of the options.\n\nTherefore, answering within the constraints given:\n[[B]]\n\n(Here \"B\" is assumed as a placeholder for an observation or comparison type methodology, speculative without direct method definitions.)"}

However, a common approach based on this principle would be to use a binomial proportion confidence interval. Since 100% of the observed sample showed good health, a conservative approach could be to estimate with a 95% confidence interval the lower and upper bounds of the proportion of healthy birds for the entire island.\n\nFor a sample size of 20 with all observations being healthy, the calculation of the exact confidence interval would need statistical software or tables. However, a rule of thumb is to consider the uncertainty around full success/failure cases. One simple and commonly used rough estimate is to use the \"rule of three,\" which suggests that if we have 0 failures in n trials, the upper bound of the confidence interval at the 95% level is approximately 3/n. However, since we have no failures (or 0 unhealthy cases) and all 20 cases are healthy, this method doesn't directly apply for an upper-bound estimation which would exceed 100%—making it less useful for this direct application.\n\nGiven these complexities and for the purpose of this question, if we consider the maximum possible proportion of healthy birds which is 100% (since all observed were healthy), and recognizing the limitations of applying direct percentages without considering sample size in terms of confidence intervals, we'll provide the answer based on observed data alone.\n\nTherefore, the estimate based solely on the observed data without adjusting for the confidence is:\n[[100%]]"}

Specifically, it assumes that Xiao Qiang's knowledge extends to include all facts derived from real-world relations, which is not necessarily true without additional premises indicating that Xiao Qiang knows those real-world connections.\n\nThis erroneous practice of shifting from a factual statement in the real world to an assertion about someone's knowledge misunderstands the nature of knowledge and the facts themselves. Such a mistake does not directly line up with the standard named logical fallacies typically provided but closely relates to an incorrect inference about someone's knowledge.\n\nGiven the options and the nature of the error, choice H - IncorrNeg Method does not directly fit as the issue is not about a negative form of reasoning or inference, negation, or quantification switch, which points toward methodological imprecision in the provided terms more akin to a general incorrect inference.\n\nHowever, aiming at the nearest semblance within the provided list to encapsulate this sort of error, we consider \"IncorrInf Method\", which perhaps could loosely be interpreted as a case for an incorrect form of inference in the broader sense of the term.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable, though not perfectly fitting, choice is \"H.
