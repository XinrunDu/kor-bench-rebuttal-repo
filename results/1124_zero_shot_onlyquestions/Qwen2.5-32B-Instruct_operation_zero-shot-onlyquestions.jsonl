However, the symbol is typically not defined in standard arithmetic or the question itself does not provide a definition, thus, we will have to assume it represents some operation for which we have to find the value of X based on a specific pattern or given operation rule.\n\nSince the operation is not specified, I'll consider a common approach often used in such puzzles where the operation is simple arithmetic, like addition or subtraction, or a less common operation such as modulo or bitwise operations. However, given the equation's structure and the given answer (3), it hints a logical or modular operation might be involved rather than a standard arithmetic operation.\n\nGiven the standard approach doesn't give us immediate insight or a direct definition in the problem, one way to tackle such an equation without any given insight about the operation \"※\" is through guessing and checking, logically assuming simple operations, or considering that the equation might involve modulo operation due to the small possible answer (3).\n\nConsidering the result of the expression equals 3, and looking for a pattern, a modulo operation could be assumed. Let's try modulo 3:\n\n1. Consider the equation under modulo 3.\n2. 19 modulo 3 is 1.\n3. 28 modulo 3 is 1.\n4. 4 modulo 3 is 1.\n5. We now need to find X such that the expression yields 3 under the assumed operation.\n\nGiven that the values modulo 3 are simplified to 1 and we get 3 as the final result, let's construct understanding based on trial and error under the assumption of modulo 3.\n\nIf we consider X can be something that makes (X※13) = 0 (under modulo 3), because 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 would modulo 3 yield 3, which simplifies to 0 in modulo 3 context. But the result we need is 3. The simplest value for X that makes this true could be such that 13 + X modulo 3 yields 3. \n\nConsidering the original equation might imply a direct value that aligns with these results without complex operations, the value of X that might satisfy this under simple assumptions and fairness to the equation structure could be thought of as 13 (under the context it simply aligns the equation towards the modulo result directly). Therefore,\n\nThe value of X should be considered based on a simple intended context,\n\n[[13]]."}

However, without explicit definitions, we can't determine exact values, but we can still reason about possible inequalities.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that § and $ represent some operations that we can reasonably guess (for example, both could be addition for this guesswork). If we consider § and $ as addition (+), the equation simplifies to: (X + 4) + (3 + 2) = 10. Simplifying this, we get X + 9 = 10, which gives us X = 1. For this operation, the equation is solved exactly, and it doesn't generate an inequality directly. Since the question asks for an inequality and we need to ensure we are answering as required, we can naturally derive that X cannot be larger than 1 (if § and $ were symbolic representations of addition).\n\nTherefore, under this assumption and considering the format required, the answer would be:\n\n[[X ≤ 1]]\n\nThis assumes § and $ were addition, and if they were any other operations or if the question requires us to consider the inequality form directly, the exact interpretation would vary.

So, (6♀2) would be 8 if '♀' were addition.\n- Now, we have 7♂8 which should equal 32.\n\nNext, we need to determine what operation '♂' could be, considering that applying it between 7 and 8 should give us 32. Considering simple operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), it's pretty clear that multiplication might be a fit.\n\nSo, if 7♂8, with '♂' being multiplication, would result in 56, this clearly does not fit our desired outcome.\n\nGiven the nature of deducing operations, let's try combination operations or a different approach. For simplicity, let's try '♂' as some transformation that might involve division or another form like subtracting and then multiplying or adding a constant.\n\nKnowing the exact nature of what '♂' and '♀' represent isn't clear from standard math terms, it suggests we might need more information on the exact nature of those operations, or it might be a specific case that isn't explicitly defined in conventional mathematics.\n\nGiven the complexity and without clear definition of the operations, pinpointing a direct computation with justification based on typical operations and given that the exact nature isn't defined, we can conclude this as an undefined operation based on provided information.\n\nHence, we provide the statement on understanding:\n[[Unable to compute with provided information]]"}
