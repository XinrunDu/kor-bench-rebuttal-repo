Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical expressions and the constraints given by Professor Wang's remarks. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Represent the Statements\nWe have the following logical expressions for each person's statements:\n\n- **Person A:**\n  - B1: !p & q (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai)\n  - B2: (!p & !q) | (p & q) (Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou nor Shanghai, or is from both Suzhou and Shanghai)\n  - B3: p & !q (Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai)\n\n- **Person B:**\n  - C1: p & !q (Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai)\n  - C2: (p & q) | (!p & !q) (Professor Wang is from both Suzhou and Shanghai, or is neither from Suzhou nor Shanghai)\n  - C3: !p & q (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai)\n\n- **Person C:**\n  - D1: !q & !r (Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor Hangzhou)\n  - D2: (!q & r) | (q & !r) (Professor Wang is not from Shanghai but is from Hangzhou, or is from Shanghai but not from Hangzhou)\n  - D3: q & r (Professor Wang is from both Shanghai and Hangzhou)\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Final Expression\nThe final logical expression is:\n\\[ E = (B1 \\& C2 \\& D3) \\ | \\ (B1 \\& C3 \\& D2) \\ | \\ (B2 \\& C1 \\& D3) \\ | \\ (B2 \\& C3 \\& D1) \\ | \\ (B3 \\& C1 \\& D2) \\ | \\ (B3 \\& C2 \\& D1) \\]\n\nSimplifying \\( E \\):\n\\[ E \\equiv (!p \\& q \\& !r) \\ | \\ (p \\& !q \\& r) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Simplified Expression\nGiven that exactly one of \\( p, q, r \\) is true:\n- If \\( p \\) is true, then \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) are false. This corresponds to \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\) being false and \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\) being false.\n- If \\( q \\) is true, then \\( p \\) and \\( r \\) are false. This corresponds to \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\) being true.\n- If \\( r \\) is true, then \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are false. This corresponds to \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\) being true and \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\) being false.\n\nSince \\( E \\equiv (!p \\& q \\& !r) \\ | \\ (p \\& !q \\& r) \\), and only one of these can be true, we have two possible scenarios:\n1. \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\) is true, meaning \\( q \\) is true.\n2. \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\) is true, meaning \\( r \\) is true.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Correct Scenario\n- If \\( q \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Shanghai):\n  - Person A: B1 is true (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai)\n  - Person B: C3 is true (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai)\n  - Person C: D1 is false (Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou)\n\n- If \\( r \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Hangzhou):\n  - Person A: B3 is true (Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai)\n  - Person B: C1 is false (Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai)\n  - Person C: D1 is true (Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou)\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Conditions\n- If \\( q \\) is true (Shanghai):\n  - Person A got everything right (B1)\n  - Person B got everything wrong (C3)\n  - Person C got half right (D2)\n\n- If \\( r \\) is true (Hangzhou):\n  - Person A got everything wrong (B3)\n  - Person B got everything right (C1)\n  - Person C got half right (D1)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only consistent scenario that matches Professor Wang's remarks is when \\( q \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Shanghai). Therefore, the answers are:\n\n- Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n- Person A got everything right.\n- Person C got half right.\n- Person B got everything wrong.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[Shanghai; A; C; B]} \\]"}

For simplicity, let's assume we are dealing with DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form), which is a disjunction (OR) of conjunctions (AND) of literals.\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form means that each clause in the DNF must contain an even number of literals.\n\nGiven that the formula contains 4 propositional variables, let's denote these variables as \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Counting Clauses with Even Number of Literals**:\n   - A clause can have 0, 2, or 4 literals to be even.\n   - For 0 literals, there is only one such clause: the empty clause.\n   - For 2 literals, we choose 2 out of 4 variables, and each chosen pair can be either positive or negative. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 is \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\). Each pair can be positive or negative, so there are \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) combinations for each pair. Therefore, the total number of 2-literal clauses is \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\).\n   - For 4 literals, we choose all 4 variables, and each can be positive or negative. The number of ways to choose 4 out of 4 is \\( \\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\). Each combination can be positive or negative, so there are \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) combinations. Therefore, the total number of 4-literal clauses is \\( 1 \\times 16 = 16 \\).\n\n2. **Counting DNF Formulas**:\n   - A DNF formula is a disjunction (OR) of these clauses. Each clause can either be included or not included in the DNF formula.\n   - The total number of possible DNF formulas is the sum of the number of ways to include or exclude each type of clause.\n\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the empty clause is \\( 2^1 = 2 \\).\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the 24 2-literal clauses is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the 16 4-literal clauses is \\( 2^{16} \\).\n\n   Therefore, the total number of DNF formulas is:\n   \\[\n   2^1 \\times 2^{24} \\times 2^{16} = 2^{1 + 24 + 16} = 2^{41}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n[2^{41}]\n\\]"}
