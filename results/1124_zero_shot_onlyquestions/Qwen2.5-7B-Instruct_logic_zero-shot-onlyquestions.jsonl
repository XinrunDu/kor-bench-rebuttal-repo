However, we simplify further:\n- If \\( p \\) is true, then \\( ( \\neg p & \\neg q ) \\) is false, and \\((\\text{False} | p) \\equiv \\text{True}\\).\n- Therefore, the whole expression simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{True} | q \\equiv \\text{True} \\]\n\nSo, \\( ((p | q) & !p) > q \\equiv \\text{True} \\).\n\nThen:\n\\[ p & ((p | q) & !p) > q \\equiv p & \\text{True} \\equiv p \\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression for (2) is:\n\\[ [p; [p]] \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe simplified logical expressions are:\n\\[ [\\text{False}; [\\text{False}]] \\]\n\\[ [p; [p]] \\]"}

We know that one person's statements are entirely correct, one's are partially correct, and one's are entirely wrong.\n\nFirst, let's represent the statements clearly:\n\n- Person A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai. This is represented as: B1 = !p & q, B2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q), B3 = p & !q.\n- Person B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou. This is represented as: C1 = !q & !r, C2 = (p & !q) | (q & r), C3 = q & r.\n- Person C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou. This is represented as: D1 = !q & !r, D2 = (p & !q) | (!q & r) | (!r & p), D3 = (p & q) | (q & r) | (!p & r).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions based on the given information:\n1. **One is entirely correct**: This means one of B1, C1, or D1 must be true.\n2. **One is partially correct**: This means one of B2, C2, or D2 must be true.\n3. **One is entirely wrong**: This means one of B3, C3, or D3 must be true.\n\nFrom the statements, we see that C1 and D1 are the same, so they must both be false, as only one person can be entirely correct. Therefore, C1 = false and D1 = false. This means the correct person must be Person A.\n\nIf Person A is correct, then B1 is true, which means:\n- !p & q (Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and is from Shanghai).\n\nNow, we need to check the consistency:\n- If q is true (Professor Wang is from Shanghai), then p must be false and r must be false (since only one is true and the other two are false).\n- Now, let's check the statements of Person B and Person C:\n  - Person B: !q & !r (Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and is not from Hangzhou). Since q is true and r is false, B’s statement is partially correct, so B2 is true.\n  - Person C: !q & !r (Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou). Since q is true and r is false, C’s statement is entirely wrong, so C3 is true.\n\nLet's summarize the expressions:\n- B1 = !p & q\n- C1 = !q & !r (false)\n- C2 = (p & !q) | (q & r) (true, as q is true and r is false)\n- C3 = q & r (false)\n- D1 = !q & !r (false)\n- D2 = (p & !q) | (!q & r) | (!r & p) (false, as only one is correct and the other two are false)\n- D3 = (p & q) | (q & r) | (!p & r) (false)\n\nThus, the corresponding logical expressions are:\n[[C1 = false]; [C2 = (p & !q) | (q & r)]; [C3 = q & r]; [D1 = false]; [D2 = (p & !q) | (!q & r) | (!r & p)]; [D3 = (p & q) | (q & r) | (!p & r)]].\n\nGiven that q is true and r is false and p is false, the expressions simplify to:\n[[C1 = false]; [C2 = true]; [C3 = false]; [D1 = false]; [D2 = false]; [D3 = false]]."}

For example, \\(P\\), \\(\\neg P\\), \\(P \\land P\\), etc., each containing only one propositional variable or its negation.\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form can be conceptualized differently depending on the exact definition in the context. A common interpretation could be a formula where every possible truth assignment to the propositional variables results in an even number of true variables. For propositional logic, this usually means a formula where the number of true variables is always even, regardless of the assignment.\n\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, let's denote them as \\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\).\n\n### Analysis of Basic Forms:\nA basic form with 4 propositional variables can only be one of the following:\n- Any single variable: \\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\)\n- Negation of any single variable: \\(\\neg P_1, \\neg P_2, \\neg P_3, \\neg P_4\\)\n\nSo there are \\(4\\) basic forms if we consider only variables and their negations.\n\n### Analysis of All-Even Forms:\nFor an all-even form, every assignment of truth values to the 4 variables must result in an even number of true variables. This is a very restrictive condition.\n\nThe number of true variables can be 0, 2, or 4 (since 1 or 3 would not satisfy the all-even requirement).\n\n- **0 true variables**: This is only the formula \\(\\neg P_1 \\land \\neg P_2 \\land \\neg P_3 \\land \\neg P_4\\).\n- **2 true variables**: Any combination of 2 out of 4 variables can be true, and the others false. This gives us \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) different combinations.\n- **4 true variables**: This is only the formula \\(P_1 \\land P_2 \\land P_3 \\land P_4\\).\n\nIn total, there are \\(1 + 6 + 1 = 8\\) all-even forms.\n\n### Intersection of Basic and All-Even Forms:\nWe need to find formulas that satisfy both conditions. For a formula to be both basic and all-even, it must be a single variable or its negation because any formula containing more than one variable cannot satisfy the all-even requirement for all assignments.\n\n- For a single variable \\(P_i\\), it is only all-even if it is always true (i.e., always 1), which means it is \\(\\neg \\bot\\) (always true, which is not a valid negation).\n- The same applies to \\(\\neg P_i\\), which would mean the negation of a formula that is always true, which is not a valid basic form.\n\nThus, no basic form can be an all-even form.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form and an all-even form is \\(0\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[]}\n\\]"}

The term `dispel` typically refers to a logical operation where we eliminate a variable from both clauses by means of a disjunctive syllogism or a similar logical principle.\n\nLet's evaluate the clauses:\n- C1 = ¬p ∨ q ∨ r\n- C2 = p ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬s\n\nWe aim to eliminate a variable, typically p or r, by considering the implications of each clause.\n\n1. **Eliminating p:**\n   - If we want to dispel p from both clauses, one of the clauses must be p = false (or ¬p = true). So, in C2, if p is false, then C2 becomes ¬r ∨ ¬s (by replacing p with false).\n   - Now, C1 remains ¬p ∨ q ∨ r, which becomes true if r is true (because ¬p is true, and it can be sufficient for C1 to be true).\n\n   Therefore, if we set p to false, both clauses are satisfied:\n   - C1: ¬p = true (satisfied)\n   - C2: ¬r ∨ ¬s (can be satisfied by setting r or s or both to false)\n\n2. **Eliminating r:**\n   - If we want to dispel r from both clauses, one of the clauses must be r = false (or ¬r = true).\n   - In C1, if r is false, then C1 becomes ¬p ∨ q (by replacing r with false).\n   - In C2, C2 remains p ∨ ¬r ∨ ¬s, which becomes p ∨ ¬s (by replacing r with false).\n\n   Therefore, if we set r to false, both clauses are satisfied:\n   - C1: ¬p ∨ q (can be satisfied by setting p = false or q = true)\n   - C2: p ∨ ¬s (can be satisfied by setting p = true or s = false)\n\nThus, we can dispel the variable p or r from both clauses. The result of `dispel(C1, C2)` in the format specified is:\n\n`[[p; r]]`\n\nThis indicates that both p and r can be dispelled from the clauses, but if we pick one variable to dispel, either p or r will do. For the sake of a single variable, we typically pick one. Thus, the simplest answer is either p or r. In the format required, we can encapsulate this as:\n\n`[p]` or `[r]`\n\nBut since the task requires a format of a single dispelled variable, we should pick one. For the sake of this response, let's dispel p:\n\n`[p]`"}

Thus, we are stating that for any pair `(x, y)`, the result of the multiplication `x * y` is `z`. \n\nHowever, in logical implementations, a direct equality assertion like this might not make sense alone without a specific formula to assert equality or further context. Given the definition, a more logical interpretation or a direct implementation in this context would be to state the function `g(x, y)` that makes `z`. Therefore, if we are to directly implement the formula based on the function provided, it would be `[g(x,y) = z]`."}

For the second formula, \\( x = \\frac{y}{z - 1} \\) must be a natural number, which is possible if \\( z \\neq 1 \\) and \\( y \\) is divisible by \\( z - 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the implementation of both formulas under \\( J \\) are as follows:\n\n**[For all natural numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), \\( z = x + y \\) satisfies the predicate \\( F(f(x, y), z) \\); for a specific \\( x \\) that is a natural number, \\( x = \\frac{y}{z - 1} \\) when \\( z \\neq 1 \\) and \\( y \\) is divisible by \\( z - 1 \\).]** \n\nGiven the format, we express it as:\n\n\\[ [[z = x + y]; [x = \\frac{y}{z - 1} \\text{ when } z \\neq 1 \\text{ and } y \\text{ is divisible by } z - 1]] \\]"}

However, the task is to identify the syllogistic form of the given premises (1 and 2).\n\n### Translating the Premises into Syllogistic Form\nThe first premise, ∀M⇒P, can be rewritten in syllogistic form as: \"If M, then P\" or \"For all x, if x is M, then x is P\". This corresponds to a universal statement of the form \"All M are P.\"\n\nThe second premise, ∀S⇒M, can be rewritten as: \"If S, then M\" or \"For all x, if x is S, then x is M\". This corresponds to another universal statement of the form \"All S are M.\"\n\nNow we need to form a syllogism by combining these statements:\n1. \"All M are P\" (Premise 1)\n2. \"All S are M\" (Premise 2)\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can infer:\n- \"All S are P\" (Conclusion)\n\n### Identifying the Figure and Mood\nIn syllogistic logic, a syllogism is characterized by its figure and mood. The figure refers to the position of the middle term in the premises, and the mood refers to the combination of the quality (affirmative or negative) and quantity (universal or particular) of the propositions.\n\n- **Figure**: Syllogism with the middle term in the same position in both premises.\n- **Mood**: The mood is determined by the quality and quantity of the premises.\n\nIn our case:\n- The middle term (M) appears in both premises.\n- Both premises are universal and affirmative.\n\nSo, the figure is I (the first figure where the middle term is the subject in the first premise and the predicate in the second premise).\n- The mood is AAI (All M are P, All S are M, therefore All S are P).\n\nThus, the syllogism corresponds to:\n**[I; AAI]**\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[I];[AAI]]"}

The middle term (M) must appear once in each of the premises, but not in the conclusion.\n\n- ∀M⇒P (All M are P) – the middle term (M) is at the beginning of the proposition.\n- ∃M⇒S (Some M are S) – the middle term (M) is at the beginning of the proposition.\n- ∃S⇒P (Some S are P) – the middle term (M) does not appear here as it is subsumed by \"S\".\n\nThis arrangement aligns with Figure II of the traditional syllogistic logic, where both premises have a universal quantifier (one with M in the antecedent and one with M in the consequent) and the conclusion has a particular quantifier.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Mood\nThe mood of a syllogism is determined by the type of categorical propositions (their quality and quantity) involved.\n\n- ∀M⇒P – Universal Affirmative (A form)\n- ∃M⇒S – Particular Affirmative (I form)\n- ∃S⇒P – Particular Affirmative (I form)\n\nThe mood, therefore, is AI-1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe argument corresponds to Figure II and mood AI-1.\n\nThe final answer is: [[II];[AI-1]]."}

Therefore, ∀S⇒¬P (If something is S, then it is not P)\n\nLet's break down the syllogism:\n\n- The first implication ∀P⇒M can be rewritten as \"If something is a P-thing, then it is also an M-thing.\" This is a universal affirmative (A) form.\n- The second implication ∀M⇒¬S can be rewritten as \"If something is an M-thing, then it is not an S-thing.\" This is a universal negative (E) form.\n- The conclusion ∀S⇒¬P can be rewritten as \"If something is an S-thing, then it is not a P-thing.\" This is a universal negative (E) form.\n\nNow, let's structure the syllogism:\n- All P things are M things.\n- No M things are S things.\n- Therefore, no S things are P things.\n\nThis can be rephrased using letters and diagrammatic representation:\n- Major Premise: \"All P are M\" (A-form: All P are a subclass of M).\n- Minor Premise: \"No M are S\" (E-form: No M are S).\n- Conclusion: \"No S are P\" (E-form: No S are P).\n\nIn syllogistic form, this is typically represented as:\n- Major Term: P (the term that appears in the conclusion and represents any P).\n- Minor Term: S (the term that does not appear in the premises but is the subject of the conclusion).\n- Middle Term: M (the term that appears in both the premises but not in the conclusion).\n\nGiven the structure, we can determine the figure and mood. The figure is the arrangement of the terms in the premises and conclusion.

Categorical syllogisms are structured as follows:\n\n1. **Figure**: The relative position of the middle term, which can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.\n2. **Mood**: The combination of the quantitative (universal or particular) and qualitative (affirmative or negative) attributes of the three categorical propositions in the syllogism.\n\nLet's break down the given logical statements and translate them into categorical form.\n\nThe logic statements are:\n1. ∀P ⇒ ¬M\n2. ∃S ⇒ M\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first statement: ∀P ⇒ ¬M.\n- This is a universal negative statement. In categorical logic, a universal negative statement \"All P are not M\" or \"No P is M\" translates to \"All P are ∁M\" where ∁M represents the complement of M.\n\nBy de Morgan's laws, \"No P is M\" can be rewritten as \"All P are ∁M\".\n\nSecond, let's analyze the second statement: ∃S ⇒ M.\n- This is a particular affirming statement. In categorical logic, this directly translates to \"Some S are M\".\n\nNow, combining these:\n- From ∀P ⇒ ¬M, we can infer that \"No P is M\" which means \"All P are ∁M\". This is a universal negative.\n- From ∃S ⇒ M, we have \"Some S are M\". This is a particular affirmative.\n\nThe mood of the syllogism is therefore: Universal negative (MEN) and Particular affirmative (SEP or SIM).\n\nNow, let's determine the figure of the syllogism. The middle term in a syllogism is that which appears in both premises but does not appear in the conclusion. Here, the middle term is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer the syllogism structure.\n\nGiven the statements:\n1. All P are not M.\n2. Some S are M.\n\nFrom these, it is not clear which term is the middle term but we need to form a syllogism. Let’s assume M is the middle term and it is distributed in both premises appropriately:\n\n1. No P is M.\n2. Some S are M.\n\nFor the syllogism to work, the structure must be:\n- \"Some S are not P\" (from 1 and 2).\n\nThis implies the syllogism can be constructed as:\n1. All P are not M.\n2. Some S are M.\n\nThis fits into the 1st figure where the middle term does not appear in the conclusion but is distributed in both premises. Thus, the figure is 1st.\n\nTherefore, the syllogism in terms of figure and mood is:\n\n1. **Figure**: 1st\n2. **Mood**: MENO\n\nSo the format is:\n[[I];[MENO]]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n[[I];[MENO]]"}

Therefore, there exist S's that are not P's (∃S ⇒ ¬P)\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Figure and Mood\n\n- **Figure**: In a syllogism, the figure is determined by the positions of the terms. If the middle term M is in the first position (as the predicate of the major premise), it is Figure III.\n- **Mood**: The mood of a syllogism is identified by the shapes of the premises and the conclusion. Here, we have:\n  - Major premise: \"All S's are M's\" (A)\n  - Minor premise: \"There exist M's that are not P's\" (O)\n  - Conclusion: \"There exist S's that are not P's\" (O)\n\nThus, the mood is AO.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe argument corresponds to the mood AO and the figure III.

For the first pair of sentences \"In public places, smoking is prohibited.\" and \"In public places, smoking is mandatory.\" These sentences have a contradictory relationship. It is not logical for something to be both prohibited and mandatory at the same time in a given context. Hence, the relationship is represented by the symbol @, which indicates a contradiction.\n   \n2. For the second pair of sentences \"Not fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" and \"Fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" These sentences describe two different scenarios. The first sentence suggests that it is permissible not to fulfill a contract, while the second suggests that fulfilling a contract is permissible. Although they are not directly contradictory, they refer to different actions within a contract. The relationship here is more a choice between two actions rather than a direct contradiction. This type of relationship is represented by B, indicating a choice or alternative relationship between the statements."}

However, the question does not provide enough context to determine which relation specifically refers to \"Reasoning Formula 17.\" \n\nGiven the options and without additional context, let's reason through each of the provided symbols:\n\n- The `∗` relation could denote a Cartesian product or a general relational operation. \n- The `↦` relation typically denotes a function or an implication in some logical systems. \n- The `춘` (often used in information retrieval and databases) can denote a join operation.\n- The `⁄` (fraction) symbol is not commonly used as a relation in the context of logical systems or databases.\n\nTypically, in formal logic or relational database theory, the `↦` (function or implication) relation is one of the more typical and straightforward relations to represent transformations or mappings between sets or propositions.\n\nSince the question does not provide enough context to definitively choose between `∗` or `⁄`, and given that `↦` is a common and clear relation, we can infer that the relation most likely meant in this context is the `↦` relation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]]."}

However, directly applying this rule to estimate proportions in a small sample size (10 students) when the population size is known (50 students) requires some assumptions about the variability and representativeness of the sample.\n\nGiven that all 10 of the randomly selected students got an A, this suggests an extreme case where the sample proportion is 100%. If we assume this sample is highly representative of the whole class, we can use this proportion to estimate the whole class's performance. However, due to the small sample size, this estimate should be treated with caution.\n\nTo estimate the proportion of the whole class that would get an A, we use the sample proportion:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sample proportion} = \\frac{\\text{Number of A's}}{\\text{Total number of students in sample}} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\]\n\nConverting this proportion to a percentage:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 100\\% = 100\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimate for the proportion of the whole class that would get an A, based on the U-Generalization Rule and the given sample, is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{100\\%} \\]\n\nIt's important to note that this is a very high and potentially optimistic estimate based on a small and likely unrepresentative sample. In real-world scenarios, further sampling and analysis would be advisable to get a more accurate estimation."}

With the given data, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of days with AQI below 50.\n\nHere are the steps to find the 95% confidence interval:\n\n1. **Calculate the sample proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\))**:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{p} = \\frac{\\text{Number of days with AQI below 50}}{\\text{Total number of days}} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the standard error (SE)**:\n   \\[\n   SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.8 \\times 0.2}{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.16}{5}} = \\sqrt{0.032} \\approx 0.179\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval**:\n   For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score (Z) is approximately 1.96.\n\n4. **Calculate the margin of error (ME)**:\n   \\[\n   ME = Z \\times SE = 1.96 \\times 0.179 \\approx 0.35\n   \\]\n\n5. **Construct the 95% confidence interval**:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{p} \\pm ME = 0.8 \\pm 0.35 = [0.45, 1.15]\n   \\]\n\nHowever, since proportions must be between 0 and 1, we adjust the upper limit to 1. Thus, the 95% confidence interval is approximately [0.45, 1.00].\n\nGiven that the lower limit of this interval is 0.45, we can say that we are 95% confident that the true proportion of days with AQI below 50 is at least 45%.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n\\[ [45\\%] \\]"}

Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant who is good at reasoning.
