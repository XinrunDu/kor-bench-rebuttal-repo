We will do this by analyzing each formula individually.\n\n### Formula 1: ~(~p1 & p2) || ~p3\n\nWe need to find the truth assignments that make this formula evaluate to false. A formula is false if the negation of its evaluation is true.\n\n1. If the formula itself (without the outer negation) is false, then the negation of its falsehood (its negation being true) would imply the formula is true. So, we need to find when the formula (without the outer negation) is true:\n   - (~(~p1 & p2)) || ~p3 is true when (~(~p1 & p2)) is true and/or ~p3 is true.\n     - (~(~p1 & p2)) is true when ~p1 is false or p2 is false.\n     - ~p3 is true when p3 is false.\n   - Combining these, the formula (~(~p1 & p2)) || ~p3 can be true with p1 being true, p2 being true or false, and p3 being false.\n\n2. Therefore, to find when the _entire_ formula ~(~p1 & p2) || ~p3 is false, we look at the _complement_ of when it is true:\n   - The formula is false when p1 is false, p2 is true or false, and p3 is true.\n\nSo, for Formula 1, the falsity values are [[F:p1, p2 (any), p3]].\n\n### Formula 2: (~p2 || p3) & (p1 => p2)\n\n1. For this formula to be false, the conjunction of its two parts must be false. This means both parts must evaluate to false simultaneously.\n   - (~p2 || p3) is false when both ~p2 is false (meaning p2 is true) and p3 is false.\n   - (p1 => p2) is false when p1 is true and p2 is false. However, since we are looking for when both parts are false, we focus on the conjunction of their conditions, which align due to our analysis of the first part.\n   - Thus, for both parts to be false, p1 must be true, p2 must be true, and p3 must be false.\n\nSo, for Formula 2, the falsity values are [[F:p1, p2, p3]].\n\n### Formula 3: (p1 => p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n\n1. For this to be false, the conjunction of both parts must fail.\n   - (p1 => p2) is false when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n   - (~(p1 & p3) || p1) is true in multiple scenarios, but specifically to make the whole conjunction false in this context, we focus on the conditions that make p1 true without affecting the necessity of p2 being false due to the first part.\n   - However, the structure of the formula means that if p1 is true, the whole formula is not necessarily false due to the second part being true. But to directly find when the entire formula is false, we look at the conditions that make the first part (the implication) false, which are p1 true and p2 false.\n   - The second part, despite needing to be false for the entire conjunction to be false in theory, due to the nature of its structure, does not independently contribute a new condition for falsity beyond what p1 and p2 being true or false already provide, given the analysis of the first part.\n\nSo, for Formula 3, similar to Formula 2 in its direct falsity condition due to the structure of the implication and the way the conjunction requires both parts to be false, the falsity values are [[F:p1, p2, p3]].\n\n**Answers Summary:**\n\n1. For Formula 1: [[F:p1, p2 (any), p3]].\n2. For Formula 2: [[F:p1, p2, p3]].\n3. For Formula 3: [[F:p1, p2, p3]].\n\nGiven the format requested ([[F:... ];[F:... ];[F:... ]]), and noting that the analysis for each formula leads to identical falsity conditions, the consolidated answer for all formulas is:\n\n```\n[[F:p1, p2, p3]]\n```\n\nThis reflects that, under the logic of each formula's structure and implications, the common condition necessary for each to be false is p1 being true, p2 being true, and p3 being false. The structure of the formulas leads to identical conditions for falsity, despiteinitial appearances to seek variations, due to the interplay between the conditions required for the implications and the conjunctions within each formula."}

The levels are as follows:\n\n- A (Atomic): A formula consisting of a single propositional letter (e.g., p, q, r).\n- Z+1 (Binary): A formula built with two A-level formulas using a binary connective. Examples include (p =::> q), (p || q).\n- Z+2 (Ternary): A formula built with three Z+1-level formulas or one A-level and two Z+1-level formulas using a ternary connective. Examples include (p =::> (q =::> r)), ((p =::> q) || r).\n- Z+n (n>2): A formula built with any number of Z+(n-1)-level formulas using n-ary connectives, where n ≥ 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given formula (~(p1 =::>~p2 ))&((p3 ||p4 )=~p1 ) step by step:\n\n1. (p1 =::>~p2 ) is a Z+1-level formula because it is built from two atomic formulas (p1 and ~p2) using the implication connective (=::>).\n2. (p3 ||p4 ) is another Z+1-level formula, as it is constructed from two atomic formulas (p3 and p4) using the disjunction connective (||).\n3. ~(p1 =::>~p2 ) is a Z+1-level formula because it is a negation of the Z+1-level formula (p1 =::>~p2 ).\n4. (~(p1 =::>~p2 ))&((p3 ||p4 )) is a Z+2-level formula, as it is built from two Z+1-level formulas using the conjunction connective (&).\n5. (~p1 ) is a Z+1-level formula because it is the negation of the atomic formula p1.\n6. (p3 ||p4 )=~p1 is a Z+1-level formula because it is a biconditional constructed from the Z+1-level formula (p3 ||p4) and the Z+1-level negated atomic formula (~p1).\n7. (~(p1 =::>~p2 ))&((p3 ||p4 )=~p1 ) is a Z+2-level formula because it is a conjunction of the two Z+1-level formulas from steps 4 and 6.\n\nThus, the level of the given formula (~(p1 =::>~p2 ))&((p3 ||p4 )=~p1 ) is Z+2.

To do this, we apply the equivalence operator (10) to the result of (p > q) and r: ((p > q) 10 r).\n3.

Simplifying, we get:\n\n(p && q) || (p && !q)\n\nThis expression simplifies further to p, as being in either 'p and q' or 'p and not q' conditions still keeps us within the scope of 'p'.\n\nTherefore, (p && q) || (p && !q) simplifies to p.\n\nLooking at the equivalences, this is not directly a match for any of them. However, it technically simplifies to p, so in a very specific sense, it can be seen as a tautology, but it does not directly correspond to one of the 16 Basic Equivalences.\n\nAnswer for Sub-question 1: B\n\n### Sub-question 2: Evaluating the validity of (2 ) (p&! q)|(! p&q)::=::(p|q)&(! (p|q))\n\nGiven expression (2) is: (p&! q)|(! p&q)::=::(p|q)&(! (p|q))\n\nThe left side of the equivalence (::=::) represents two cases: 'p is true and q is false' OR 'p is false and q is true'. This effectively means 'p and q have different truth values'.\n\nThe right side of the equivalence is 'p or q' AND 'not(p or q)', which is a contradiction because 'p or q' cannot be simultaneously true and false.\n\nSince the left side correctly captures the condition of p and q having different truth values, while the right side is a contradiction, they are not equivalent.\n\nAnswer for Sub-question 2: B\n\n### Overall Answer:\nThe answers to the two sub-questions are:\n\n[[B];[B]]"}

The caret (^) symbol denotes logical conjunction (AND), not disjunction (OR). Therefore, we are looking for pairs of disjunctive terms that are combined via conjunction in the given expression.\n\nGiven the expression:\n\\[(p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r) \\land (\\neg p \\lor \\neg q \\lor r)\\]\n\nThe paired disjunctive terms are those that are logically connected by the conjunction (AND) operator within each parenthesis, as the overall expression is a conjunction of these two disjunctions. Thus, there are two pairs within the expression itself, considering each parenthesis as a unit for pairing purposes:\n\n1. Pair from the first disjunction within the first parenthesis: \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg q\\) and \\(r\\). These can be considered one paired disjunctive term since they are connected by the OR operator.\n2. Pair from the first disjunction within the second parenthesis (note there's no new pairing within the same level of parentheses as the first, as the OR disjunctions are identical except for the first variable): \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(\\neg q\\) and \\(r\\). These constitute another paired disjunctive term for the same reason.\n\nGiven the format requested:\n\n```\n[[paired disjunctive terms: (p, ¬q, r); (¬p, ¬q, r)]; [denoted: (p∨¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨¬q∨r)]]\n```\n\nThis format accurately reflects the question's request. The expression is clearly denoted as a conjunction of two identical disjunctions, with each disjunction considered a \"paired disjunctive term\" due to the way the logical connectors are organized within the expression. There's no need for further separation of terms into \"pairs\" considering the OR operation across the entire expression as asked, as the question's wording initially seems to imply looking for pairs at the level of conjunction within the given structure, leading to the interpretation of individual disjunctions as the \"pairs\" due to the absence of different disjunctive pairs within the same level of OR operations in the provided expression."}

However, DNF typically involves ORing AND terms with a maximum principle where each variable appears once and only once in its true and complemented form over all the terms, and this structure is not fully met in the given expression. The given expression does not simplify to the exact PDNF due to the interconnections and dependencies between the variables that DNF would ideally aim to isolate. \n\nGiven the structure and the operations involved, the expression is closer to CNF (CNF involves ANDing OR terms), but it does not simplify directly to the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) either, because PCNF typically involves unique combinations of variables or their negations without repetition or unnecessary terms, which is not clearly achieved in the given expression through mere logical manipulation as it stands. The expression involves three distinct OR terms within the scope of an AND operation, suggesting a CNF-like structure, but the \"principle\" or \"minimality\" criteria for PCNF (where each variable or its negation appears exactly once in a clause) are not fully met with the direct decomposition or simplification of the given expression without rewriting the entire expression from a minimized set of literals.\n\nTherefore, based on the initial analysis, the expression does not conform to either the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) or the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) in its current form. The closest alignment would be with CNF due to the structure of ANDing OR terms, but the \"principal\" aspect required for PCNF is not met.\n\n#### Answer Format:\n[[B]]"}

The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and understand the requirements.\n\n1. **Formula A contains 4 propositional variables.** This means the formula consists of logical statements involving these 4 variables.\n\n2. **The formula is a tautology.** A tautology is a formula that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its constituent propositional variables. This means the formula is essentially saying something that cannot be false, like \"It's either raining or it's not raining.\"\n\n3. **The formula is a basic form.** Without a specific list of basic forms provided, we can interpret this to mean that the formula is one of the fundamental logical constructs used in propositional logic, such as \"and,\" \"or,\" \"not,\" \"implies,\" or some combination of these that simplifies to a tautology when considering four propositional variables.\n\nGiven these considerations, one of the simplest and most common basic forms that fit the criteria of being a tautology when expanded to include four propositional variables is the tautology derived from the \"Or\" operation across all variables. This is because, logically, at least one of four propositional variables must be true, ensuring the formula's truth value remains true (1) regardless of the variables' specific truth assignments. The formula for this situation, when expanded to include four propositional variables, would look like:\n\n\\[ A = (p \\lor q \\lor r \\lor s) \\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\) are the four propositional variables. Since at least one of these must be true for the overall statement to be false (and thus, it's a tautology), and this structure is a fundamental logical operation (the \"Or\" condition), it fits the description.\n\nTherefore, the format for denoting such a formula is:\n\n```\n[[p ∨ q ∨ r ∨ s]]\n```\n\nwhere \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), and \\(s\\) are the propositional variables, and \\(\\vee\\) represents the \"Or\" operation, ensuring the formula is a tautology across any truth assignment of its variables. \n\nThis answer simplifies the complexity of the query by identifying the most straightforward tautological structure based on the number of variables and the requirement that it be a fundamental form, which is a common teaching methodology in logic and mathematics education."}

Your task is to try to answer the following questions.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's break down what is meant by \"basic form\" and \"all-even form\" in the context of propositional variables and formulas.\n\nA basic form in propositional logic is typically a form that involves only one propositional variable. However, the question specifies that we are looking for formulas that are both a basic form and an all-even form, which introduces a new criterion not commonly associated with basic forms. Given that \"all-even form\" is a less standard term in this context, we can infer it means a formula that only uses even numbers of occurrences of propositional variables. Since we are dealing with propositional variables, \"even\" occurrences mean that a variable is either not used (0 occurrences) or used an even number of times (2, 4, 6, etc.). Therefore, in the context of this question, a \"basic form\" that is also \"all-even\" would involve a propositional variable either not used at all or used exactly twice, keeping the entire formula structurally \"even\" in its variable usage.\n\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, we consider each variable to be either not included (0 occurrences) or included exactly twice (2 occurrences) in the formula to satisfy both the \"basic form\" (since the operation or connective would make it count as a \"basic form\" in terms of structure, though this term is loosely interpreted here to mean \"pertaining to a single variable or a minimal, easily evaluable configuration involving symmetry or simplicity,\" which in our case is symmetry or evenness in variable usage) and the \"all-even form\" (where the number of occurrences is even).\n\nFor each of the 4 propositional variables:\n- It can either not be used (0 occurrences) or used exactly twice (2 occurrences).\n\nThis gives us a binary choice for each of the 4 variables, leading to \\(2^4\\) possibilities. However, we must correct our interpretation for the \"all-even form\" condition, which specifically applies to the number of occurrences being even. The mistake in the straightforward calculation is that it doesn't fully align with the strict interpretation of \"all-even form\" in the context of minimizing the formula while still adhering to an even number of total occurrences across the variables.\n\nGiven the clarification needed for the term \"all-even form\" in a strictly literal sense (interpreting it as focusing on the even number of total occurrences across the variables), the simplest way to satisfy this condition for a \"basic form\" (in a context that emphasizes evenness in usage rather than the usual minimal complexity) is to structure the formula such that each of the 4 variables is either entirely absent (0 occurrences) or present exactly twice (2 occurrences). However, because the question frames \"all-even form\" in a manner that seems to mesh more with the number of occurrences rather than the structural simplicity of a \"basic form\" typically understood, we must ensure our count reflects the even distribution of presence across the variables without delving into more complex logical structures that might mix variables in more intricate ways.\n\nThe correct interpretation to satisfy both conditions (being a \"basic form\" in the context of focusing on evenness in variable usage and being an \"all-even form\" in terms of even occurrences across all variables) is to acknowledge that the \"basic form\" isn't strictly about the complexity of the logical operation but rather about the even distribution of variable usage. Therefore, the formula structure that accommodates an even number of total occurrences across all 4 variables, distributed either not used at all or exactly twice, is the key.\n\nThe correct approach to count valid formulas under these conditions is to recognize that each variable can be in one of two states: not used or used twice, but this does not directly translate to \\(2^4\\) formulas due to the specific constraint of evenness across variable occurrences in a \"basic form\" structure. The misunderstanding in the initial leap to \\(2^4\\) arises from not fully integrating the nuances of the \"all-even form\" criterion with the practical application of variable occurrences in a basic structure.\n\nGiven the constraint of even occurrences and the structure of a \"basic form\" under the evenness condition, the most straightforward interpretation that adheres to both the \"basic form\" (in terms of evenness of presence) and \"all-even form\" (in terms of even total occurrences) is to consider that the formula's \"simplicity\" or \"basicness\" in this context is best served by the even distribution of variable usage, not the complexity of logical operations. Therefore, the correct intuitive leap that misses the mark in the \\(2^4\\) calculation is recognizing that the even constraint for each variable's occurrence is fulfilled only by the formula structure that inherently results from the even condition across all variables, without the need to enumerate complex combinations that might randomly use variables under an even constraint, which isn't efficiently captured by a simple exponential count.\n\nThe question, in its current form, doesn't provide a straightforward mathematical answer based on the standard definitions of \"basic form\" and requires a creative interpretation focused on the even occurrence condition. The strictest interpretation, aiming to find how many such \"basic forms\" that are also \"all-even forms\" for a formula with 4 variables, would理论上 lead to considering the most basic structure that satisfies the even occurrence condition directly, which isn't simply a count of variations but rather recognizing the structural constraint imposed by the requirement for evenness across all variable occurrences.\n\nGiven the challenge in directly applying a \\(2^4\\) calculation due to the specific interpretation of \"all-even form,\" the answer here isn't to provide a numerical count without further clarification on how to correctly apply the \"all-even form\" condition in this context, as the initial logical leap leads to a misunderstanding of the structure's constraints under the combined definitions provided.\n\nThe answer, in the format requested, that reflects the precision of the question's complexity and the need for interpretation is not directly provided by a simple number but rather highlights the need for clearer criteria for evaluating \"basic forms\" that are also \"all-even forms\" in this specific logical structure with even occurrence constraints. In essence, the question invites a deeper dive into the definition of \"basic form\" within the context of even occurrence structures, making the straightforward application of \\(2^4\\) or any specific number an oversimplification that misses the nuanced interpretation required. \n\nTherefore, while a specific numerical answer in the strict format requested isn't directly provided, the response emphasizes the need for a nuanced interpretation of the terms given the unique criteria of the question, highlighting the complexity of satisfying both a \"basic form\" and \"all-even form\" under even occurrence constraints in a structure involving 4 propositional variables."}

To determine if these clauses can be resolved, we need to consider the resolution process in propositional logic, specifically the resolution rule, which seeks to derive a contradiction from a set of clauses.\n\nThe resolution rule works by taking two clauses where one contains a proposition and the other contains the negation of the same proposition, and then eliminating these conflicting literals.

The resolution process requires a direct opposition between literals (e.g., A and ~A) to proceed.

In propositional logic, \"dispel\" is typically used to refer to the act of negating or contradicting a statement. Since C2 = s, we can substitute s into C1 to see the contradiction.\n\nGiven:\nC1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬s\nC2 = s\n\nSubstituting C2 into C1 where ¬s appears:\n\nC1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬(s)\n   = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬(C2)\n   = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r ∨ ¬s (since ¬(C2) = ¬s)\n\nHowever, because C2 = s, the part of C1 where it says ¬s and then s directly contradicts itself. When you have a statement AND its negation together (e.g., something is true AND it's not true), the result is a contradictory statement that is always false, regardless of the values of the individual propositions.\n\nTherefore, dispelling C1 with C2 essentially leads to a contradiction, which can be represented as False in logical terms. However, since the question asks for the answer in the format [[]], which seems to imply a structure rather than a simple True or False, and given that the question doesn't directly ask for a truth value but rather what dispelling C1 with C2 results in, we can hypothesize that the intended answer might be focused on the structure of the contradictory statement rather than a simple True or False value.\n\nThe structure of the contradictory statement within C1, with C2 being s and directly contradicting the ¬s part of C1, can be represented in a way that shows the direct contradiction, but due to the categorical nature of the contradiction (it leads to a statement that is inherently and inevitably False, given the premise), the most logical interpretation within the [[]] format, from a logical standpoint, would simply mark the presence of the contradiction without further structuring, because the contradiction itself nullifies any specific structure within C1 that would remain true.\n\nSo, while a straightforward True or False ([]) could represent the logical outcome of the operation as False due to the contradiction, maintaining the format [[]] and considering the request for an answer structured in this way, and acknowledging that the operation results in a contradictory state that disrupts any normal operation or truth-preserving structure within C1, one could interpret the answer as:\n\n[[False]]\n\nThis is because the operation, in a strict logical sense, results in a False statement due to the direct contradiction, and the [[]] format is preserved by encapsulating False in another pair of brackets, reflecting the contradictory nature that wipes out the original structure of C1 upon application of C2."}

S0 (Initial set): This is the set of clauses that need to be resolved. Given the formula (¬p ∨ q)∧(p ∨ q) ∧ (q), we can break it down into the following clauses:\n   - (¬p ∨ q)\n   - (p ∨ q)\n   - (q)\n\n   To represent these as clauses, we can convert the conjunctions (∧) into disjunctions (∨) by applying De Morgan's laws and double negation elimination. This results in:\n   - (¬¬p ∨ q) : (¬p → q)\n   - (¬p ∨ q) : (p → q)\n   - (q) : q\n\n   Since there are no initial clauses in this problem, S0 is an empty set ∅.\n\n2. S1 (After the first loop iteration): The first loop iteration involves adding the negation of the formula to the set of clauses. In this case, the formula is (¬p ∨ q)∧(p ∨ q) ∧ (q).\n   - We need to add the negation of the formula, which is ¬((¬p ∨ q)∧(p ∨ q) ∧ (q)). Applying De Morgan's laws, we get:\n     ¬(¬p ∨ q) ∨ ¬(p ∨ q) ∨ ¬(q)\n   - Simplifying the negations using double negation elimination:\n     ((p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)) ∨ ¬q\n   - This simplifies further to:\n     (p ∨ ¬p) ∧ ¬q\n   - The first term can be simplified to a tautology (p ∨ ¬p) ≡ true, so the formula becomes:\n     true ∧ ¬q\n   - Thus, its negation is simply:\n     ¬(true ∧ ¬q) ≡ false\n\n   Since the negation of the formula results in a false value, we add it to S0, which remains unchanged as an empty set ∅.\n\n3. S2 (After the second loop iteration): At this point, we simply add the original clauses to S1 since no resolution has taken place yet. So, S2 is the same as S1:\n   - {¬p, q}\n   - {p, q}\n   - {q}\n\nTherefore, the sets S0, S1, and S2 before starting the resolution algorithm are:\n\n[∅; ∅; {¬p, q}; {p, q}]"}

Let's break down the statement into its constituent parts and simplify it using basic logical equivalences.\n\nGiven: p∧(p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(q∨¬r)∧(q∨r)\n\nStep 1: Apply the Distributive Law (p∨(q∧¬q) = p) to remove contradictions.\n- (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q) is a tautology and simplifies to p.\n\nStep 2: Substitute p for the simplified expressions and apply the same logic to any remaining pairs.\n- Our given statement now looks like this: p∧p∧(q∨¬r)∨(q∨r)\n- Since we have p∧p, which simplifies to p, our statement becomes: p∧(q∨¬r)∨(q∨r)\n- Notice that (q∨¬r)∨(q∨r) is true because either q or ¬r can make the left part true, and if not, r will make the right part true, giving us a tautology. This simplifies to TRUE.\n\nGiven the simplification, the original statement is equivalent to just p because the rest of the clauses are either redundant or simplify to a tautology.\n\nNow, to apply the resolution algorithm, we would typically have a set of clauses where each clause is a disjunction of literals. However, since our simplified statement is just p, there is no need for the resolution algorithm in its standard form, as we've already reduced it to a single literal. \n\nBut, for the sake of answering based on the initial format asked for and following the logical progression as if we were preparing for the resolution algorithm, we would start with the original clauses before simplification, treating them as separate clauses in the set. Given that our simplification directly leads to a single literal (p), the initial sets (S0, S1, S2) before any resolution cycles would essentially capture the original clauses. However, since our process simplified to just p, in a strict interpretation of the question asked for preparation of the resolution algorithm:\n\n- **S0 (Initial clauses):** [p], [q], [¬q], [¬r], [r]\n- **S1 (After first round of resolution, which in this case simplifies to S0 due to our simplification):** [p], [q], [¬q], [¬r], [r]\n- **S2 (As S1 and no further resolution due to our simplification to just p):** [p], [q], [¬q], [¬r], [r]\n\nIn the format requested, with each set represented as {p, q, ¬q, ¬r, r}, since our final simplification and application of the resolution algorithm in the strict sense (as initially unfolded) doesn't lead to any reductions beyond what we've logically done, S0, S1, and S2 are identical as described. However, it's important to note that the logical progression and the final answer do not align with the typical iterative process of the resolution algorithm due to the initial simplification. \n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n- **S0:** {{p}; {q}; {¬q}; {¬r}; {r}}\n- **S1:** {{p}; {q}; {¬q}; {¬r}; {r}}\n- **S2:** {{p}; {q}; {¬q}; {¬r}; {r}}\n\nThis answer, while structured according to the question's format, reflects a scenario that deviates from the usual application of the resolution algorithm due to the initial simplification of the logical statement."}

The given formula can be simplified using logical equivalences as follows:\n\nGiven: p ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ r)\n\nBy the Law of Excluded Middle (p ∨ ¬p), we can deduce (p ∨ ¬q) ≡ T (True), because p ∨ ¬p is always true. Similarly, (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ q (since ORing with a complementary pair of literals results in the non-complemented variable). So, the formula simplifies to:\n\np ∧ (p ∨ q)\n\nBy the Distributive Law, we can rewrite this as:\n\n(p ∧ p) ∨ (p ∧ q)\n\nSince p ∧ p ≡ p, the formula further simplifies to:\n\np ∨ (p ∧ q)\n\nNow, applying the Resolution Algorithm directly on this simplified formula might not be straightforward because the resolution operation typically works on clauses (pairs of literals negated or not) that are OR'ed together. The given formula is not in a purely clause form with exclusive OR's. However, we can attempt to apply resolution by considering the simplified formula as a CNF using the distributive law once more:\n\np ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ (p ∨ p) ∧ (p ∨ q)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\np ∧ (p ∨ q)\n\nNow, focusing on the resolution aspect, the resolution algorithm combines two clauses if they contain opposite literals and produces a new clause without these literals. In our case, the clauses are not directly set up for resolution because one literal (p) appears positively in both parts of the formula, and there is no clause with the opposite literal (¬p) to resolve with. Therefore, the resolution algorithm as traditionally applied to find a contradiction or simplify a CNF formula doesn't yield a clear output from this starting point because the formula simplifies to a tautology that doesn't require resolution to prove its truth under classical logic.\n\nGiven this, the output of the resolution algorithm for the initial formula as directly formulated is not straightforward for resolution because it doesn't lead to a contradiction or a simplified form that contrasts with the given axioms (it's always true). However, for the purpose of answering with a response based on the question's structure, if we were to apply the resolution on the simplified form (p ∨ (p ∧ q)), we would note that there is no clear resolution step because there are no complementary literals across different clauses from which to resolve.\n\nAs for the number of cycles, since the formula simplifies to a tautology without leading to a contradiction that would require resolution to resolve (as no such resolution opportunity exists given the form), the number of cycles would be considered 0, as there's no iterative resolution process to undertake.\n\nHowever, it's important to clarify the direct application of the resolution algorithm to this simplified form due to the nature of the simplification leading away from a typical resolution scenario. \n\nGiven these qualifications and explanations, the answer in the requested format, reflecting the nature of the question's expectation rather than a strict resolution process, would be:\n\n[[\"no specific output; simplification to tautology\"];[0]]\n\nThis answer acknowledges the unique nature of the question and the specificity of applying the resolution algorithm to a formula that simplifies to a tautology without a clear path for iterative resolution."}

For simplicity, we will use two transistors and two resistors in this example. Typically, an AND gate requires two inputs, so we will use A and B as our input variables.\n\nHere's a simple circuit diagram for an AND gate using transistor logic:\n\n1. **Input 1 (A):** Connect A to the base of the first transistor (Transistor 1) through Resistor 1.\n2. **Input 2 (B):** Connect B to the base of the second transistor (Transistor 2) through Resistor 2.\n3. **Output (OUT):** Connect the collectors of Transistor 1 and Transistor 2 together and then to the positive voltage supply (Vcc). Connect the emitter of both transistors to ground (GND). The point where the collectors meet (between Transistor 1 and Transistor 2 collector) is the output (OUT).\n\nThe output voltage (OUT) will reflect the logical AND operation based on the input voltages (A and B). Since we're describing this in a text-based format, let's translate the circuit into the requested format:\n\n```\n[[0, 0], 0],\n[[0, 1], 0],\n[[1, 0], 0],\n[[1, 1], 1],\n[[circuit off], 0],\n[[neither on nor off; in undefined state], 0]\n```\n\nExplanation of the states:\n- **[[0, 0], 0]:** If both inputs A and B are at low voltage (0), the base of both transistors will not be triggered to the point where they allow current to flow from the collector to the emitter, resulting in no path for current to flow from Vcc to GND. Therefore, OUT is at the high voltage state (0, indicating logical 0 or 'off').\n- **[[0, 1], 0]:** Only B is high, so Transistor 2 remains closed (no output current since there's no path for current to flow from Vcc to GND), and the output remains logical 0.\n- **[[1, 0], 0]:** Only A is high. Similar to the previous case, Transistor 1 remains closed, and the output remains logical 0.\n- **[[1, 1], 1]:** Both A and B are high, triggering both transistors to open. This creates a path from Vcc to GND, allowing current to flow. OUT is at the low voltage state (1, indicating logical 1 or 'on').\n- **[[circuit off], 0]:** When the power is off, there is no current flowing through the circuit, and both transistors will be open, preventing current from flowing to OUT, keeping it at the logical 0 state.\n- **[[neither on nor off; in undefined state], 0]:** In any state where the input is neither fully on nor fully off (e.g., if the inputs are floating or the input voltages are in between logic levels), the circuit will likely default to the off state due to the nature of transistor logic, where the transistors need a strong trigger to fully open. In a real-world scenario, proper input conditioning is necessary to avoid undefined states. Here, the assumption is that such states are interpreted as neither input being fully high (1), resulting in OUT being at the logical 0 state.\n\nThis explanation simplifies the behavior of transistor-based logic gates for educational purposes, glossing over the nuances of transistor operation and the need for proper biasing and stability in actual circuits."}

The expression involves two operations: AND (conjunction, represented by ∧) and OR (disjunction, represented by ∨).\n\n1. **Inputs**: p, q, r\n2. **First AND gates**: Apply AND operation on p and q; on p and r. This will give us two outputs, one for (p∧q) and the other for (p∧r).\n3. **Second OR gate**: Apply OR operation on the outputs of the first set of AND gates. This will be the final output of the circuit.\n\nGiven this setup, the circuit diagram can be represented as follows, where each set of brackets represents the output of each gate, and the final output is the result of the OR gate.\n\n```\n[[p, q, r],                             ; Inputs\n [(p∧q), (p∧r), p],                     ; Outputs of the AND gates (first column) and the input 'p' for the OR gate\n [((p∧q)∨(p∧r)), ((p∧q)∨(p∧r)), (p∧q), (p∧r), p]] ; Final output (OR gate result), and intermediate outputs for clarity\n```\n\nTo provide the outputs in the requested format:\n\n```\n[[p=0, q=0, r=0], [0, 0]],\n[[p=0, q=0, r=1], [0, 0]],\n[[p=0, q=1, r=0], [0, 0]],\n[[p=0, q=1, r=1], [0, 0]],\n[[p=1, q=0, r=0], [0, 1]],\n[[p=1, q=0, r=1], [0, 1]],\n[[p=1, q=1, r=0], [0, 1]],\n[[p=1, q=1, r=1], [1, 1]]\n```\n\nThis format lists each combination of input states (p, q, r) and the corresponding output when the circuit is powered (0 or 1) and when it is not powered (which is irrelevant for a simple circuit like this, as it's either powered up and running or not). The last column in the original detailed explanation is included for clarity, showing the intermediate outputs of the first AND gates, which are essential for building the final OR gate output but not typically part of the concise output format requested. \n\nThe key to understanding this format is recognizing that for each combination of input states, the circuit produces a specific output when powered, regardless of whether it's powered or not (since it's a static description of output based on input). The simplification of not including the \"output when circuit is not powered\" column is based on the fact that in conceptual explanations of simple logic gate circuits, the focus is on the operational state, ignoring the scenario where the circuit is not powered."}

In logical expressions, \"-\" is often used to represent False or 0.\n\nThe expression can be broken down into three disjunctions:\n\n1. (p∧q∧¬r) -> True if p=True, q=True, and r=False.\n2. (¬p∧q) -> True if p=False, q=True, and r can be either True or False because of ¬p∧q - the expression only needs q to be True for it to be True.\n3. (p∨r) -> True if p=True, q can be either True or False, and r=True. If r=False, then p must be True for the expression to be True.\n\nGiven these conditions, there are multiple input combinations that could lead to a False (\"-\") output. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. [[];[];[]] = [True; True; False] - This satisfies the first condition: (True∧True∧¬False) which simplifies to (True∧True∧True), which is True. But since all three conditions need to be False for the entire expression to be False, this is not a valid solution by itself. However, for educational purposes, it shows how one condition can be satisfied.\n\n2. [[];[];[]] = [False; True; False] - This satisfies the second condition: (¬False∧True) which simplifies to (True∧True), thus True. It does not satisfy the first or the third condition, but since we need to find an input that makes the entire expression False, we look further.\n\n3. [[];[];[]] = [True; False; False] - This does not satisfy any of the three conditions individually but needs to be considered in the context of the entire expression because the expression is a disjunction of these conditions, meaning only one needs to be True for the entire expression to be True. Since r is False in every case, it can lead to a False outcome by not satisfying any of the individual conditions. For example, if we consider [True; False; False], it does not satisfy (p∧q∧¬r) or (¬p∧q), but it does satisfy (p∨r) since p is True, which makes the entire expression True. However, if r were True, the third condition (p∨r) would still be True regardless of p's value, as r is True. Therefore, to find a scenario where the entire expression evaluates to False, we need to consider inputs that do not satisfy any of the three conditions when taken individually.\n\n4. [[];[];[]] = [False; False; True] - This input does not satisfy any of the conditions. Both p and q are False, and r is True, so none of the individual disjunctions are True. Since the entire expression requires at least one of the disjunctions to be True for it to be True, this combination satisfies the requirement of the entire expression being False in a scenario where r does not need to be False for any of the given conditions to hold true.\n\nTherefore, one set of inputs that satisfies the entire logical expression as False is [False; False; True]. However, it's important to note that there are multiple configurations that could satisfy this condition, depending on how you interpret the requirement for each condition within the disjunctions. The key is to ensure that none of the individual disjunctions are satisfied simultaneously, which is the case with [False; False; True]. Other combinations that could work similarly include [True; False; True] (which satisfies the third conjunction but not the others when considered in the context of the entire disjunctive expression), but [False; False; True] is one straightforward example that adheres closely to the logical structure of the given expression without satisfying any individual conditions."}

This can be interpreted as: for all x in the set of natural numbers N, x multiplied by 2 is equal to x.\n\n(2) ∃xF(f(x, a), y)→∃yF(f(y, a), x)\nThis formula states that if there exists a natural number x such that the function fJ(x, a) (which is the addition function) applied to x and the constant a' (which is 2) yields a result that is equal to y, according to the predicate FJ(x, y), then there exists a natural number y such that the function fJ(y, a) applied to y and the constant a' yields a result that is equal to x. In simpler terms, if adding 2 to some natural number x results in a value that is equal to another natural number y, then there exists a natural number y such that adding 2 to y results in the original natural number x.\n\nNow, let's write down the implementation of the given formulas under J in [[];[]] format:\n\n(1) ∀xF(g(x, a), x) can be represented as:\n[[\"∀\";\"x\";\"∈\";\"N\"],[\"FJ\";[\"gJ\";[\"x\";\"a'\"]];\"x\"]]\n\n(2) ∃xF(f(x, a), y)→∃yF(f(y, a), x) can be represented as:\n[[\"→\";[\"∃\";\"x\";\"∈\";\"N\"],[\"FJ\";[\"fJ\";[\"x\";\"a'\"]];\"y\"];[\"∃\";\"y\";\"∈\";\"N\"],[\"FJ\";[\"fJ\";[\"y\";\"a'\"]];\"x\"]]\n\nNote: The variables \"y\" in the second formula are distinct, as indicated by the different indices in the quantifiers (x representing a specific natural number that satisfies the condition, and y representing the natural number that the condition is being checked against). In the original question's context, there is only one mention of \"y,\" but in the logical formula, we interpret it as two separate variables due to their roles in the formula."}

Without knowing the specific method or operation to apply, it's impossible to provide a direct answer.\n\nFor the sake of completing the task as requested, if we were to arbitrarily apply a method that concludes whether a statement is true or false, the result based on the given sentence \"Some products are not top-grade\" would be:\n\n```\n[status: true]\n```\n\nThis is because the sentence correctly conveys that not all products are of top grade, which is a true statement. However, this is a hypothetical interpretation of \"method A\" and does not reflect a specific method mentioned in the question. The actual result of executing \"method A\" would depend on the definition of that method, which is not provided."}

This is a valid logical inference, and the conclusion perfectly aligns with the third premise of the syllogism.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements in terms of the four figures:\n\n1. First Figure:\n   Major premise (GP): All P are M.\n   Minor premise (GP): All S are P.\n   Conclusion (GP): All S are M.\n\n2.

However, since the conclusion is specifically \"Some S are P\" which is an I-type, we rule out the OAO mood because it would not lead to an I-type conclusion. Additionally, the mood must match the given premises of an A-type and an I-type.\n\nThe IAI mood fits these criteria:\n- Major premise (Premise 2) is I-type (Some M are S).\n- Minor premise (Premise 1) is A-type (All M are P).\n- The conclusion (Some S are P) is I-type.\n\nTherefore, the figure and mood of the syllogism are [[IV];[IAI]]."}

Fourth Figure:\n   Some S is P.\n   All M is S.\n   ∴ Some M is P.\n\nThe mood of a syllogism refers to the type of the three propositions used in the syllogism. There are 24 possible moods (4 * 3 * 2) based on the Aristotelian logic, but we'll focus on the ones that match the structure of our given statements.\n\nThe structure of our given statements seems to match the First Figure, as:\n- ∀M⇒¬S (All M are not S) implies \"All M is not P\" (since we have ∀M⇒¬S and ∀S⇒¬P, which together suggest a contradiction that all M lead to ¬S and from ¬S follows ∀S⇒¬P, indicating M→¬P).\n- ∀P⇒M (All P are M) directly implies \"All M is P\".\n\nTherefore, the given argument corresponds to a First Figure.\n\nFor the mood, since the given premises lead to a contradiction in terms and don't directly map to a standard mood (as the traditional moods focus on categorical syllogisms that don't inherently contain contradictions like ∀S⇒¬P which negates itself when considering ∀M⇒¬S and ∀P∨M), we cannot directly assign a standard mood from the 24 possible moods found in classical syllogisms without contradiction. The structure and logical progression suggest a hypothetical scenario that doesn't perfectly fit a traditional Aristotelian mood due to the contradiction between ∀S⇒¬P and the implications of ∀M⇒¬S and ∀P⇒M.\n\nHowever, for the sake of illustration, if we were to humor the given premises without considering the contradiction, and just for the purpose of identifying which mood could have led to this structure if the contradiction were not present, we might tentatively consider a hypothetical mood that mirrors the form of conversion in the first premise (from All P are M to All M are P) and then following a valid middle term through the second premise (All M are not S). This would not be accurate given the actual content of the premises, but it serves to show that the structure itself suggests the First Figure without considering the contradiction. If we were to ignore the contradiction and just look at the form, one might loosely think of a mood like \"Barbara\" for the first two premises, and then considering the negation in the third premise, it's crucial to note that this is a stretch and purely illustrative due to the contradiction present.\n\nGiven the contradiction and the strict requirements of classical syllogism logic, the most accurate answer focusing on the format requested is:\n\n[[I]; [N/A (due to contradiction)]]\n\nThis response underscores the importance of logical consistency and the fact that the given statements lead to a contradiction, which is not typical of standard syllogisms and thus doesn't fit neatly into a conventional mood and figure classification. The initial assessment of the figure was correct based on the structure alone, but the mood designation is moot due to the contradictory nature of the premises."}

A standard categorical syllogism has the following form:\n\n1. Major premise (premise involving the major term)\n2. Minor premise (premise involving the minor term)\n3. Conclusion (involving the remaining terms)\n\nThe figures of a syllogism are categorized by the position of the middle term relative to the conclusion:\n\n- Figure I: Middle term in the preamble of the conclusion\n- Figure II: Middle term in the postamble of the conclusion (after the minor term)\n- Figure III: Middle term in the preamble of the conclusion\n- Figure IV: Middle term in the conclusion but nowhere in the premises\n\nThe moods of a syllogism are determined by the quality and quantity of the premises and conclusion.\n\nGiven the logical statements:\n- ∀P⇒¬M: \"All Ps are not M.\" (This can be simplified to: \"No P is M.\")\n- ∃S⇒M: \"Some S is M.\"\n- ⇒∃S⇒¬P: \"Therefore, some S is not P.\"\n\nLet's assign letters to the categorical propositions for reference:\n- Major term: P\n- Minor term: S\n- Middle term: M\n\nThe given statements translate to:\n- Major premise: No P is M. (Negative, Universal)\n- Minor premise: Some S is M. (Affirmative, Existential)\n- Conclusion: Some S is not P. (Negative, Existential)\n\nNow, let's identify the figure:\n- The conclusion \"Some S is not P\" places the middle term (M) before the minor term (S), indicating Figure I.\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure I of categorical syllogisms. To determine the mood, we consider the quality and quantity of the propositions:\n\n1. Major premise: Negative, Universal\n2. Minor premise: Affirmative, Particular (since \"Some S is M\" is not a universal statement about S)\n3. Conclusion: Negative, Particular\n\nGiven the premises and conclusion, we match these qualities and quantities to the traditional moods of a syllogism. The mood is determined by the quality (affirmative or negative) and quantity (universal or particular) of each proposition, which corresponds to:\n\n- Negative, Universal (Major)\n- Affirmative, Particular (Minor)\n- Negative, Particular (Conclusion)\n\nThis combination does not directly map to one of the standard moods (A, E, I, O) because the major premise's quality and quantity are not typical of the standard moods. However, for the purpose of identifying the figure, we've already determined it to be Figure I. The standard moods apply when the premises and conclusions follow the classical forms (e.g., AAI for First Figure), but the given premises do not fit neatly into one of these classical moods due to the specificity and structure of the logical operators in the premises.\n\nThus, based on the figure alone, which is the primary focus of the question, the answer is:\n\n[[I];[N/A (not a standard mood)]]\n\nThe mood cannot be accurately classified as one of the traditional moods (A, E, I, O) due to the unique formulation of the premises using logical operators instead of the traditional categorical terms."}

The argument starts with a universal proposition (A), uses a particular negative (O) to reach a particular negative conclusion (O), which corresponds to Figure III.\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure III, and its mood is determined by the types of propositions used:\n- First premise: A (universal affirmative, \"All P are M.\")\n- Second premise: O (particular negative, although disguised as an obverted form, it essentially works as an O when considering its role in the conclusion, \"Some S are not M.\")\n- Conclusion: O (particular negative, \"Some S are not P.\")\n\nThus, the mood of the syllogism is an OAO (O-A-O) syllogism.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument corresponds to [[III];[OAO]]."}

The comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Water Geology Team have created a \"file\" for each well, also citing historical data to support their conclusion that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to identify the method used for deriving cause and effect in this passage. The methods listed (A to E) are represented in square brackets on various writing systems, which suggests a language-specific approach. However, in this context, the numbers A to E do not represent specific writing systems but rather the labels for the methods. Therefore, to find the correct method, we should look at the pattern of reasoning applied in the passage rather than attempting to match it to a specific writing system.\n\nThe passage does not explicitly mention any of the methods (A to E) from the given options as a specific method of reasoning. Instead, the cause and effect relationship is established through historical data and observation:\n\n1. **The first wells were dug in the early 1970s** - This sets the timeline for the introduction of deep wells in Shanghai.\n2. **By the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells** - This shows the gradual increase in the number of wells and the amount of water being extracted as the city's history progresses.\n3. **During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased** - This period is highlighted as a significant increase in the number of wells and a corresponding increase in ground subsidence.\n\nThe reasoning in the passage is not directly associated with any specific method (A to E) mentioned, as these methods seem to be placeholders for different writing systems or ideograms rather than standardized logical or scientific reasoning methods. However, the essence of the reasoning is inductive, based on historical data and the observation that ground subsidence has been a direct consequence of the increase in the number of deep wells and the amount of underground water used.\n\nGiven the options, none of the listed methods (A to E) from the writing systems provided directly match the reasoning in the passage. However, if we were to apply a logical framework to the passage, the method could be considered a form of inductive reasoning (commonly associated with scientific investigation and discovery) rather than one of the specific ideograms mentioned.\n\nSince none of the provided ideograms (A to E) directly fit as a recognized logical or scientific reasoning method relevant to the passage's cause and effect derivation, and given the lack of a standard logical method match among the options, the most accurate answer based on the context provided would be to recognize the passage's reasoning as a form of observational, inductive reasoning rather than a specific method denoted by (A to E).\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is: [[N/A]], as none of the provided methods (A to E) are correctly attributed to the reasoning process described in the passage. The passage's reasoning process is inductive, observational, and grounded in historical data, which is more broadly categorized than the specific methods listed."}

The P-Generalization rule, also known as the law of large numbers, states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean. In other words, if we have a large enough sample, the proportion of days with an AQI below 50 in our sample can be used to estimate the proportion of days with an AQI below 50 in the whole city.\n\nGiven that the air quality test was conducted on 5 randomly selected days and 4 of those days had an AQI below 50, the proportion of days with an AQI below 50 in this particular sample is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ days with AQI below 50}}{5 \\text{ total days}} = 0.8 \\]\n\nThis means that 80% of the days sampled had an AQI below 50.\n\nApplying the P-Generalization rule, to estimate the proportion of days in which the average AQI of the city was below 50, we would use the sample proportion as an estimate for the population proportion. Given that the sample size is relatively small (n=5), the accuracy of this estimate depends on the representativeness of the sample and the consistency of the air quality in the city over time. However, based on the data provided:\n\n\\[ \\text{Estimated proportion of days with AQI below 50} = 0.8 \\]\n\nThis translates to 80%.
