This is represented by the expression \"Blue & Yellow,\" where \"&\" denotes the logical \"and\" operator. \n\nProposition (2) indicates that either √3 or 5 is irrational. We use the \"|\" operator, which denotes the logical \"or\" to represent this relationship. \n\nLastly, proposition (3) states that exactly one of √3 and 5 is irrational. For this, we use both \"|\" and \"~\" (denoting negation). The expression reads \"(~√3) & (~5)\", which means \"it is false that √3 is irrational and it is false that 5 is irrational\". Thus, exactly one of them must be irrational for this expression to be true."}

Let's break them down and analyze them:\n\n1. If the proposition SIP is false, it means that the statement represented by SIP is not true. Now, the statement \"SIP implies SOP\" can be written as:  \"If SIP is true, then SOP is true\". Typically denoted as \"SIP → SOP\" Now, if SIP is false, the \" → \" (implication) arrow is never traveled, so the truth value of SOP doesn't really matter. In other words, it is called a \"vacuous truth.\" Since SIP is false, we don't have to explore the truth value of SOP to know that \"SIP implies SOP\" is true. Therefore, ISSIP → SOP regarless of whether SOP is true or false.\n\n2. For the second question, we have a similar scenario as the first one. If the statement \"SOP is false\" regardless of whether SIP is true of false, we are only considering a situation where the premise of an implication is false.\n\nThe \"SOP → SIP\" statement reads as: \"If SOP is true, then SIP is true\". In this case, If SOP is false, then the \" → \" (implication) arrow is never traveled and then the truth value of SIP doesn't matter. The \"SOP → SIP\" statement is a vacuously true statement and can't be falsified if SOP is false.\n\n3. \"If the proposition SAP is true, then the proposition SEP is what?\"\n\nThis is an example of a suffiient condition proposition. The \"SAP is true\" will make the statement \"SAP → SEP\" true, regardless of whether SEP is true or false. Placing the question in context, the truth of SAP ensures the implication \"SAP → SEP\" is true. However, the truth value of SEP doesn't alter the truth value of the implication statement.\n\n4. \"If the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is what?\"\n\nThis scenario deals with a necessary condition statement. Consequently, if SEP is true, we know that the implication statement \"SEP → SAP\" is true if and only if SAP is true. For a necessary condition (SEP) to contribute to a true proposition, the sufficient condition (SEP) must also be true. Therefore, if SOP is true, then SAP is at least true.\n\nTaking the answers and applying them to the requested format; [[True;True];[True;True];[True;N/A];[True;True]]"}

The four figures also determine how the premises establish the relationship between the middle term (M) and the other terms - in other words, the mood of the syllogism. There are four possible moods - AAA, AII, AEI, and EIO - and each mood applies to one of the possible figures.\n\nIn this case, the statement ∀P⇒¬M reads \"For all P, if P then not M\" or \"Whenever P is true, M must be false.\" This is similar to the form P→~M expressed in Propositional Logic. The statement ∃S⇒M is similar, in that it suggests a one-way implication: \"If there is a case for S, M must hold true.\" Or, in other words, \"Given that there is a case for S, it establishes that M is true.\" Lastly, ∃S⇒¬P is a syllogism conclusion expressed as \"If there is a case for S, P must be false.\"\n\nPutting these three statements together, we have:\nP→¬M\nIf P is true, then M must be false.\nS→M\nIf there is a case for S, then M must be true.\nS→¬P\nIf there is agiven for S, it establishes that P must be false.\n\nThis syllogism comes out as Figure I (AAI) in a valid form."}

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.

In this case, we have a sample of 10 students from a class of 50 students, and all 10 students got an A on the math test.\n\nTo estimate the proportion of the whole class that would get an A, we can use the concept of proportionally extending the result from the sample to the larger population. In this scenario, we assume that the performance of the initial 10 students is indicative of the overall class's performance.\n\nGiven that all 10 students received an A, we can express the proportion as 100% for that sample. Now, we want to estimate what percentage of the entire class of 50 students would get an A.\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the following formula:\nEstimated Proportion = (Sample Proportion) * (Total Population) / (Sample Size)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nEstimated Proportion = (100%) * (50 students) / (10 students)\n\nNow, let's calculate it:\nEstimated Proportion = 100% * 5 = 500%\n\nSo, according to the U-Generalization Rule, the estimated proportion of the whole class of 50 students that would get an A is 500%.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a theoretical estimation based on the given information. In reality, there might be variability in students' abilities and performance, and the actual outcome might differ. This estimation assumes that the sample is representative of the entire class, which may not always be the case."}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !
