The double negation (\"not\" and \"never\") makes the second sentence affirm the first.  If one is true, the other *must* also be true, and if one is false, the other *must* also be false. This is often represented by the ※ symbol in logic.\n\nThe second pair of sentences have a entailment relationship (↦).

Since there are 4 propositional variables, each variable can appear either positively, negatively, or not at all in a basic form.  However, to be a basic form, each variable must appear exactly once, either as itself or its negation. This gives 2 choices (positive or negative) for each of the 4 variables.  Thus, there are 2^4 = 16 possible basic forms.\n\nAn all-even form is a Boolean formula where, when expressed in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), every clause contains an even number of literals.  All basic forms are also in DNF (they are a single clause). Since a basic form contains exactly one instance of each variable (either negated or not), every basic form *always* has an even number of literals (4 in this case).\n\nTherefore, all 16 basic forms are also all-even forms.\n"}

This formula isn't.  For example, if p is true, q is false, and r is true, the formula evaluates to false.\n\n* **Contradiction:** A contradiction is *always* false. This formula isn't. For example, if p, q, and r are all true, the formula evaluates to true.\n\n* **Basic formula:**  This term usually refers to atomic propositions (single variables like p, q, r) or their negations. This formula is a complex expression.\n\n* **All-even formula:** This typically refers to a formula where all clauses have an even number of literals.  (¬p∧¬q∧r) has three literals (odd) and (p∧q∧r) also has three literals (odd).\n\n* **All-odd formula:** Similar to all-even, but requires all clauses to have an odd number of literals. While both clauses here *are* odd, the term isn't commonly used and usually applies within specific contexts like parity games.\n\nTherefore, none of the provided options correctly describe the given formula.\n"}

The other rules don't fit:\n\n* **Substitution, Sequence, Choice, Loop, Concurrent:** These relate to program structure and control flow, not resource dependencies.\n* **Interruption, Exception:** These deal with unexpected events, not predictable outcomes based on resources.\n* **Dependency, Priority:** While related to resources, they don't capture the certainty of the outcome *given* the resource.  Dependency just says `c` needs `R`, not what happens when `R` is met.  Priority describes which process gets a resource first, not the guaranteed outcome.\n* **History, Prediction:**  History refers to past behavior; Prediction is a broader term.  Neither specifically addresses resource limitations as the *reason* for the certain outcome.\n\nTherefore, the **Resource Limitation Rule (H)** is the most appropriate answer.\n"}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes.

If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept.

This statement is true under interpretation J.  Let's break down why:\n\n    * **The left side ∃x(x + 2 = y)**:  This asserts the existence of an x that satisfies the equation.  For any given y ≥ 2, there exists an x (specifically, x = y - 2) that makes this true.

For any given x ≥ 2, there exists a y (specifically, y = x - 2) that makes this true. If x < 2, then no natural number y satisfies the equation.\n\n    * **The implication**:  An implication P → Q is only false when P is true and Q is false.\n\n        * **Case 1: Left side true, Right side true**: If y and x are both ≥ 2, both sides are true, thus the implication is true.\n        * **Case 2: Left side false, Right side true**:  If y < 2, the left is false.  The right side might be true (if x ≥ 2) or false (if x < 2). In either case, the implication is true.\n        * **Case 3: Left side false, Right side false**: If y < 2 and x < 2, both sides are false, thus the implication is true.\n        * **Case 4: Left side true, Right side false**: This case cannot happen.  If the left side is true, it means y ≥ 2, and there exists an x = y - 2.  Then, for the right side, we can choose y' = x (which is ≥ 0), meaning the right side will also be true.\n\n    Because the fourth case (the only one where the implication is false) is impossible, the entire statement is true.\n]];[]\n"}

This means 2 is prime, and *everything else* is not prime.  We'd also need a predicate C(x) for \"x is composite\". This implies a similar structure for C(4). Since the prompt states 0-ary predicates should be used, and F(x) is provided as unary,  we would theoretically need an infinite conjunction to cover all integers for both prime and composite. This is impractical to write out fully, hence the ellipses (...). It's also important to define C(x) even if only used for one number in the prompt because the statement specifies that 4 IS composite, implying other numbers are NOT.\n\n**(2)** This is a straightforward conditional statement.

LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\nThis closely resembles the structure of the Lottery Paradox (LS Paradox).  The core of the LS Paradox involves a tension between accepting highly probable individual statements (like \"this particular lottery ticket will lose\") and their collective implication (that all tickets will lose, which contradicts the premise that there *is* a winning ticket).\n\nHere, `R(x)` can be thought of as \"ticket x loses\" and `B(x)` as \"I believe ticket x loses\". The given conditions mirror the Lottery Paradox:\n\n* **∀x(R(x) → B(x))**: If a ticket loses, I believe it loses (reasonable belief).\n* **R(a) ∧ B(a)**:  A specific ticket *a* loses and I believe it loses (a specific instance of the general rule).\n* **∀x(R(x)→B(x)) ≡ ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))**:  The logical equivalence points to the idea that if I don't believe a ticket loses, it must be a winner (contrapositive).  This is analogous to the Lottery Paradox's implication that if even one ticket *doesn't* lose, it must be the winner.\n* **¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x))**: If there's a ticket *b* that I don't believe loses and it indeed doesn't lose (i.e., it wins), then it implies I believe all losing tickets lose (which seems trivially true, but creates a paradox due to the other statements). This is similar to how the existence of a winning ticket, while not contradicting individual beliefs about losing tickets, creates a tension with the collective belief.\n\nThe Grue-Bleen (GB) Paradox deals with inductive reasoning and justification of hypotheses, and the Raven's Paradox (sometimes known as the BC Paradox, though Hemp's paradox might be a more common usage of BC) deals with confirmation of hypotheses by seemingly irrelevant evidence. Neither of those fit the structure presented as well as the Lottery Paradox.\n"}

Categorical syllogisms deal with quantifiers (all, some, no) applied to relationships between *three* terms.  The provided statement has quantifiers and implication, but it relates four terms (M, P, S in two different existential quantifications).  Therefore, it doesn't fit any of the standard syllogistic figures or moods.\n\n\nLet's break down why it doesn't fit:\n\n* **Syllogisms have three terms:**  A major term (predicate of the conclusion), a minor term (subject of the conclusion), and a middle term (present in both premises but not the conclusion).  This statement uses M, P, and S... but the \"∃S\" seems distinct from the \"S\" in \"∃M⇒S\".  Even if we treated them as the same S, we have four terms if you consider the implied term in \"∀M⇒P\" which we could express as \"∀M(M⇒P).\"\n\n* **Syllogisms have two premises and a conclusion:** The given statement looks like a single compound statement connecting different implications. It's not clearly broken into premises and a conclusion.  We *could* interpret it as \"(∀M⇒P and ∃M⇒S) implies (∃S⇒P),\" but that's not a standard syllogistic form.\n\n* **Syllogistic figures are defined by the position of the middle term:**  Since we can't clearly identify a middle term in the standard sense, we can't determine a figure.\n\n* **Syllogistic moods are defined by the types of propositions (A, E, I, O):**  The propositions here aren't standard A, E, I, or O propositions. They are implications involving quantifiers.\n\nIn summary, the provided statement isn't a categorical syllogism, so it doesn't correspond to any figure or mood. It's a statement in predicate logic.\n"}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ￥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant who is good at reasoning.

Let's represent p1, p2, and p3 with binary digits (0 for false, 1 for true).  The inner expression is only true when p1=1, p2=1, and p3=0 (represented as 110).

As established above, this only occurs when p1=1, p2=1, and p3=0 (110).  So the falsity value is 110.\n\n\n**Explanation for (2) (~p1 & p2) => (p1=p3)**\n\n* **Truth Value (T):**  An implication (A => B) is only false when A is true and B is false. Let's analyze that condition for this formula:\n\n    * **(~p1 & p2) is true:** This occurs when p1=0 and p2=1 (010, 011).\n    * **(p1 = p3) is false:** This occurs when p1 and p3 have different values (p1=0, p3=1  OR  p1=1, p3=0).\n\n    Combining these, the only scenario where the entire implication is FALSE is when p1=0, p2=1, and p3=1 (011).  Therefore, the implication is TRUE for all other combinations: 000, 001, 010, 100, 101, 110, 111.\n\n* **Falsity Value (F):** As explained above, the only case where the formula is false is when p1=0, p2=1, and p3=1 (011).
