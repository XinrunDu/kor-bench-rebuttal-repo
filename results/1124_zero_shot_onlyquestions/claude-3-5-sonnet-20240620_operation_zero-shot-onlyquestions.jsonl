However, given that we have functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, it's more likely that this notation represents a non-standard operation being applied to the functions.  Without further context or definition of the $\\triangle$ operator, we cannot definitively compute $f \\triangle g$.\n\nIf $\\triangle$ were intended to represent multiplication, then $f \\triangle g = f(x) \\cdot g(x) = x^3 \\sin(x)$.\n\nIf $\\triangle$ were intended to represent function composition, it would typically be denoted as $f \\circ g$ or $f(g(x))$, resulting in $f(g(x)) = (x)^2 \\sin(x) = x^2 \\sin(x)$. Conversely, $g \\circ f$ or $g(f(x))$ would result in $x^2 \\sin(x)$.\n\nIf $\\triangle$ were intended to represent addition, then $f \\triangle g = f(x) + g(x) = x^2 \\sin(x) + x$.\n\nIf $\\triangle$ were meant to represent subtraction,  then $f \\triangle g$ could be either $f(x) - g(x) = x^2 \\sin(x) - x$ or $g(x) - f(x) = x - x^2 \\sin(x)$.\n\nSince the question doesn't define $\\triangle$, the most reasonable guess, given the format of the problem, is multiplication.

We're given the equation (6⊕3) + (X⊕2) * 2 = 10 + 11i.  It seems ⊕ represents some operation. Since the result involves a complex number (10 + 11i), it's likely ⊕ is complex multiplication.\n\nIf ⊕ is complex multiplication, then (6⊕3) is simply 6 * 3 = 18.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n18 + (X⊕2) * 2 = 10 + 11i\n\n(X⊕2) * 2 = 10 + 11i - 18\n\n(X⊕2) * 2 = -8 + 11i\n\nAssuming X is a complex number, let X = a + bi. Then (X⊕2) is (a + bi) * 2 = 2a + 2bi.\n\nSo, (2a + 2bi) * 2 = -8 + 11i\n\n4a + 4bi = -8 + 11i\n\nNow we can equate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n4a = -8  =>  a = -2\n\n4b = 11  =>  b = 11/4\n\nTherefore, X = -2 + (11/4)i.

However, we can express the relationship between 6 and X based on the fact that the total sum must equal 15.\n\nIf (9 § 2) results in a positive number, then (6 $ X) must be less than or equal to 15.  This would imply some form of limitation on X relative to 6.\n\nIf (9 § 2) results in a negative number, then (6 $ X) must be greater than 15 to compensate and reach the total of 15.  This would also imply a relationship between 6 and X.\n\nSince we are constrained to using only ≥ or ≤, and we don't know the operations, we must consider the most general case.  Given that (6 $ X) needs to combine with (9 § 2) to result in 15, we can only deduce that (6 $ X) must be *less than or equal to* 15 if (9 § 2) is non-negative, and *greater than or equal to* 15 if (9 § 2) is negative. We are asked to express the answer in terms of X. Without knowing the operation $, we can't definitively constrain X.  Therefore, we must consider the broadest possible inequality for X, encompassing all possibilities. This would be equivalent to saying X belongs to all real numbers.

We are given 7 ♂ (6 ♀ 2) = 32.  We need to find what operations ♂ and ♀ could be to satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's consider some common operations.  If ♀ is addition, we have 7 ♂ (6 + 2) = 7 ♂ 8 = 32.  If ♂ is multiplication, then 7 * 8 = 56, not 32.

There is no obvious integer operation that will do this.\nWe could consider ♂ as a function such that f(x, y) = x * y/14 + 4.\nThen 7 * 12/14 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10, which is incorrect.\nLet's consider 7♂(6♀2) where ♂ is + and ♀ is *.  Then 7+(6*2) = 7+12=19. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's try defining ♂ as * and ♀ as -.\n7*(6-2) = 7*4=28.\nNow consider if ♀ is division.  7 ♂ (6 / 2) = 7 ♂ 3.  If ♂ is multiplication, this would be 21, not 32.\n\nLet's try ♂ as multiplication and modify ♀ such that 6 ♀ 2 = 4 + 4/7.\nThen 7 * (4 + 4/7) = 28 + 4 = 32.  This could define ♀, though it's not a typical binary operation.\n\n\nLet's define  ♂ as x * y + 4. \nIf ♀ is subtraction:\n7♂(6-2) = 7*(6-2)+4 = 7*4+4 = 28+4 = 32.\n\nSo if ♂ is defined as a*(b)+4 and ♀ is subtraction, then this works.\n\n\n[[32]]\n"}

Given the functions f(x,y) and g(x,y),  the most reasonable interpretation of  f■g is function composition. Since both f and g are functions of two variables, and produce a single value, composition would mean applying one function to the output of the other. There's no indication that x and y should be treated as vectors for some sort of dot product.\n\nLet's represent the composition as (f∘g)(x,y):\n\n(f∘g)(x,y) = f(g(x,y)) = f(cos^2(x) + y, y)  Note: The second 'y' here is typically *not* replaced with anything from the output of g(x,y). Function composition works by substituting the entire output of g into wherever x appears in the definition of f.\n\nSo, f(cos^2(x) + y, y) = sin^2(cos^2(x) + y) + y\n\nThis resulting expression is still a function of x and y. We aren't given specific values for x and y to calculate a single number.  Therefore, *f■g is not a single number*.\n\n*If*  ■ was intended to represent adding the functions, then:\n\nf(x,y) + g(x,y) = sin^2(x) + y + cos^2(x) + y = (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) + 2y = 1 + 2y.  This is still not a single number without knowing y.\n\n*If* it was multiplication:\n\nf(x,y) * g(x,y) = (sin^2(x) + y)(cos^2(x) + y) = sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + ysin^2(x) + ycos^2(x) + y^2 = sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + y(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)) + y^2 =  sin^2(x)cos^2(x) + y + y^2.  Again, not a single number.\n\nSince the problem explicitly requires a single numerical answer,  and we aren't given values for x and y, and the operation ■ is ambiguous, there's no way to produce a valid answer. I'll proceed assuming addition and y=0 since that gets us closest.\n\nf(x,0) + g(x,0) = sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\n[[1]]\n"}
